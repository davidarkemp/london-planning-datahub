The Travel Plan shall include an action plan with timescales for the implementation of the proposed measures, funding, details of an ongoing programme of monitoring and review and targets for reductions in car use. Monitoring and review shall include the submission of annual travel plan update report for the approval of the Local Planning Authority which contains the results of annually repeated staff travel surveys and demonstrates progress towards meeting targets.\r\rReason: These details are required prior to commencement of development because the details would affect subsequent design of other elements of the scheme and must be agreed at the outset and to ensure that sustainable transport methods are encouraged and implemented in accordance with Policies CS5 (Reducing the Need to Travel) and CS6 (Sustainable Travel) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r",
    "Notwithstanding the provisions of Schedule 2, Part 3, of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order, 2015, (or any Order revoking or re-enacting this Order) no change from B1, B2, and B8 uses are permitted without the prior written consent from the Local Planning Authority.\r\rReason: In order to ensure that land and premises are available for both traditional and office based employment activities (B1, B2 and B8 uses) in accordance with Policy CS11 (Economy and Employment) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012\r",
    "Paragraph A.4 - (7) of Schedule 2, Part 1, Class A of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended) states that \"Where any owner or occupier of any adjoining premises objects to the proposed development, the prior approval of the local planning authority is required as to the impact of the proposed development on the amenity of any adjoining premises\".\r\r1 letter of objection has been received from an adjoining neighbour raising concerns regarding impact on amenity. Therefore the Council is permitted to assess the proposals as per Paragraph A.4 - (7) of Schedule 2, Part 1, Class A of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).\r\rThe proposed rear extension would pass the 45 degree rule on both plan and elevation in relation to adjoining premises, in compliance with BRE Guidance. The proposed development would therefore not result in a significant loss of light to No. 57 and No. 61 The Ridings.\r\rOverall, it is considered that the proposed extension would not result in a significant and unacceptable adverse impact on the residential amenities of an adjoining property, thereby complying with Policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy, 2012 and Council's Residential Design Supplementary Planning Document, 2013.\r",
    "The proposed outbuilding would be 3 metres in height and would be within 2 metres of the boundary of the curtilage of the dwellinghouse in conflict with Class E (e) (ii). A bathroom is proposed for which sufficent justification has not been provided.",
    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwelling.\r\r2 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations have been received. \r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings. \r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed two storey rear extension would project to a modest depth, match the eaves height of the original roof and have a hipped roof form that would be in keeping with the existing dwelling. Aluminium finishes are proposed for the window and door frames and the proposal would not extend beyond the principal side elevation and therefore would not be viewed from the street scene. The reduction of the bay window at first floor level in the rear elevation would be acceptable and be in keeping with the character of the original dwelling.  Officers also note that a similar two storey rear extension was granted permission at neighbouring property, No. 83 Latchmere Lane (see ref. 01/06178/FUL).\r\rTherefore, the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development. \r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rOfficer Comment: The two storey rear extension would not extend beyond the principal existing side elevation, thus maintaining the separation distance between neighbouring property No.81 Latchmere Lane. No. 77 Latchmere Lane would be seperated from the proposed development by approx 3m. Given the siting of the development in relation to the neighbouring properties, and the fact that the windows in the southern flank elevation of No. 81 Latchmere Road are obscure glazed and do not relate to habitable rooms, the extension would not have any adverse effect on the amenities of the neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance nor loss of light/sunlight. Further the proposal does not propose any openings to the side elevations and therefore there would be no loss of privacy for the neighbouring properties.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
    "The assessment has been based on the original layout of the house that shows a rear outrigger. The proposed extension would extend beyond the side elevation of the outrigger and would have a width greater than half the width of the original dwellinghouse, in conflict with Paragraph A.1 (j) (iii) of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "Officers note two objections have also been received in relation to the proposed extension but it has not been necessary to assess neighbouring amenity as the proposed development would not be permitted development.",
    "The assessment of this application is based on measurements taken from the submitted drawings / plans. If it transpires that the drawings / plans submitted are incorrect this would nullify the validity of this decision and you are advised to submit a fresh application with the correct information / drawings.",
    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwelling.\r\r34 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations have been received. \r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings. \r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed first floor rear extension element would project modestly in depth and be finished in materials that would match the existing dwelling. It would not project beyond the principal side elevation nearest the shared boundary with No. 11 Lowther Road and would not be viewed from the streetscene. Therefore, it would be considered an appropriate and subordinate addition to the host property and surrounding area. \r\rOfficers note that Policy Guidance 39 of the Residential Design SPD 2013 recommends against mansard roof extensions, noting that the roof extensions should ensure that dormer windows complement the original design of the house and do not dominate the existing roof form. While the proposed mansard roof form would be large and of a design that is out of keeping with the host dwelling, it would not be not be visible from the street scene on Lowther Road and would only gain limited views from the adjoining properties. Further, the depth and scale of the mansard roof extension in combination with the rear dormer would not appear as an incongruous addition to the host property.  Therefore, the proposed development would have a limited effect on the character and appearance of the immediate area as well as the original dwelling.\r\rThe proposal also includes a rooflight to the front of the roof slope, and given that there are existing rooflights to the front roof slopes of properties within Lowther Road, the proposed rooflight would appear in keeping with the area.\r\rTherefore, on balance, the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development. \r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rOfficer Comment: Given the siting and position of windows within the proposed mansard dormer roof extension and the first floor rear extension, it is considered that the developments would not cause undue harm to the amenities of neighbouring occupiers by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. \r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",

    "The site comprises a detached dwelling. \r\rA Blanket Tree Protection Order covers the site but the proposed works are not within the vacinity of any trees.\r\rFourteen neighbouring properties have been notified and no representations have been received.\r\rRBK Tree & Landscape Officer - No objection\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design.

    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwelling.\r\r2 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations have been received. \r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings. \r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed part two storey rear extension would extend to a modest depth, extend to match the eaves height and have a hipped roof form that would match the existing dwelling. While aluminium finishes are proposed for the windows and doors, the proposal would not extend beyond the side elevation and therefore not be viewed from the street scene. \r\rTherefore, the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development. \r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rOfficer Comment: The part two storey rear extension would not extend further than the existing side elevation, thus maintaining the separation between neighbouring property No.81 Latchmere Lane. No. 77 Latchmere Lane would be seperated from the proposed development by approx 3m. Given the siting of the development in relation to the neighbouring properties the two storey extension would not have any adverse effect on the amenities of these properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light/sunlight. Further the proposal does not propose any openings to the side elevations and therefore there would be no loss of privacy for the neighbouring properties.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",

    "The site comprises a mid terrace dwelling which falls within the Thetford Road Local Area of Special Charater.\r\r5 neighbouring properties have been notified and no representations have been received.\r\rThis application follows a previous refusal for a similar proposal (20/01030/HOU dated 13.07.2020) which was refused due to the total loss of the front boundary treatment which would result in an unacceptable harm to the character and appearance of the application dwelling and the wider Local Area of Special Character and also due to the on-site car parking space facilitated by the proposed crossover would not be of sufficient depth so as to accommodate the safe parking of a motor vehicle. The applicant has addressed both of these issues.\r\rRBK Neighbourhood Engineer - No highways objection in principle but requested information regarding the highways crossover policy be passed on to the applicant. \r\rRBK Tree and Landscape Officer - No objection\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r- The impact of the development on Highway safety\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of design and it would retain elements of soft landscaping. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  Due to the nature of the proposal, it is considered that the proposed dropped kerb would not cause any undue harm to the amenity of neighbouring occupiers. It is therefore not expected that the proposal would generate significant noise and disturbance, beyond the existing situation. The proposal would therefore be compliant with Policy DM10 of the Core Strategy and Policy Guidance of the Council's Residential Design SPD.\r\rPolicy CS7 of the Core Strategy (Managing Vehicle Use) sets out that the Council will - part d - manage on and off-street parking provision to promote sustainability and residential amenity and smooth traffic flow.\r\rThe NPPF requires that in assessing applications for development, it is ensured that: appropriate opportunities to promote sustainable transport modes can be - or have been - taken up; safe and suitable access to the site can be achieved for all users; and any significant impacts from the development on the transport network (in terms of capacity and congestion), or on highway safety, can be cost effectively mitigated to an acceptable degree.\r\rAs noted above, the Highways and Transport department were consulted and athough they have not raised an objection to the application they have requested that the applicant be informed that, if planning permission is granted, a separate application will still need to be made to the Highway Department for the approval of the vehicular crossover. As part of the separate vehicular crossover consent, compliance with the RBK Vehicle Crossover Policy, April 2020 will be checked as part of an on-site survey. If, at that survey, it is established that the proposed crossover would encroach into the root protection area of the substantial street tree in front of No. 22 The Spinney the crossover application could be refused. The applicant is therefore advised to check this themselves as the application fee would not be refunded in this situation. \r\rNo issues have been identified in relation to highway safety.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan, Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
    "Highway trees will not be removed to allow a vehicle crossover. If there is conflict with an established street tree on the public highway, a vehicle crossing cannot be constructed within the root protection area (RPA) of the tree in accordance with British Standards (currently BS 5837:2012). As a guide, for a tree with a single stem, the RPA is calculated as 12 times the stem diameter, measured at a height of 1.5m above the ground level.",
    "The crossover would also be dependent on lowering of the existing services, which will require the necessary utilities provider's approval and may incur considerable expense for which the applicant would be wholly liable.",
    "The site comprises a semi-detached cottage which is part of the Old Coach House. The building as a whole is a locally listed Building of Townscape Merit (BTM).\r\rSeven neighbouring properties have been notified and no representations have been received\r\rHistoric England - No Comment\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development and the impact on a locally listed building and the wider area; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rPolicy DM12 is clear that the Council will: 'ensure that development proposals affecting historic assets will use high quality materials and design features which incorporate or compliment those of the host building or the immediate area' and preserve or enhance the existing heritage assets of the Borough through the promotion of high quality design.\r\rOfficer Comment: Policy Guidance 34  of the Residential Design SPD states that in relation to a second storey rear additions the following guidance applies :\r- The roof should relate well to the host property and its existing roof and should not be higher than the ridge of the existing roof.\r- The roof should never encroach on the sill of windows of the 2nd floor.\r- Flat roofs should generally be avoided unless a flat roof is a feature of the existing building.\r\rThe proposed first floor extension would be a flat roof addition. This roof type would be incongruous and jarring when viewed within the street scene and would not relate well to the roof of the locally listed BTM.
