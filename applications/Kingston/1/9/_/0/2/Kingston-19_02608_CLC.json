    "The details submitted for Condition 11 (Refuse and Recycling Facilities)  of Planning Permission 18/12928/FUL by the applicant are considered insufficient and of an unacceptable design. The applicant has not demonstrated beyond the balance of probabilities that the proposal ensures the provision of satisfactory refuse and recycling facilities in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.",
    "Eaves height is measured from ground level at the base of the outside wall to the point where that wall would meet the upper surface of the roof slope. The proposed elevation plan shows this measurement to be 3 metres to the point where the wall would meet the lower surface of the roof slope. Therefore the actual eaves height would be over 3 metres in conflict with paragraph A.1 (i) of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "Please provide copies of all existing and proposed elevations at a recognised scale of 1:50 or 1:100, providing a scale bar, showing all elevations not just part and indicating all key dimensions for the proposed work.\r\rPlease note that we do require elevations showing the location of all windows.  They could be on the same drawing with a note to say that the proposed would be the same as existing."
