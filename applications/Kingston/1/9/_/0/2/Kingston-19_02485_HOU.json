    "Unless otherwise agreed in writing with the Local Planning Authority, a means of enclosure shall be erected along the full east and west boundaries of the terrace hereby approved prior to the beneficial occupation of the development hereby approved in accordance with a scheme which has first been submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority. The means of enclosure is to be retained for the life of the development. \r\rReason: In order to ensure the privacy and visual amenity of adjoining occupiers is retained in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.",
    "The assessment of this application is been based on measurements taken from the submitted drawings / plans. If it transpires that the drawings / plans submitted are incorrect this would nullify the validity of this decision and you are advised to submit a fresh application with the correct information / drawings.",
    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwelling.\r\rFive neighbouring properties have been notified and 1 objection and 1 comment have been received which have been taken into consideration in the assessment of this application.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of and and buildings.\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  It is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would accord with the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2016) Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwelling.\r\rRepresentations:\r7 surrounding owner/occupiers were notified of the proposals.  One letter has been received regarding the following summarised concerns: \r\r-\tExcessive height or bulk of buildings\r-\tLoss of light/Sunlight\r\rThe above concerns would be addressed in the report. \r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of the adjoining buildings.\r- The impact of the proposal on parking facilities\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: \rIt is acknowledged that the proposed single storey side extension and front porch would not be strictly in accordance with Policy Guidance 35 and 38 of the Council's Residential Design SPD. However considering the adjoining property and existing street scene that shows similar proposals, the proposed single storey side extension and front porch are considered acceptable in terms of design and massing. \r\rThe proposed materials for the front elevation of the new side extension and front porch have not been specified and it is unclear how the proposal would relate the host dwelling and surrounding area. \r\rDespite the loss of the garage, it is considered that the hardstanding to the front of the dwelling remains of an adequate size to accommodate 2 off street car parking spaces, therefore the parking facilities would not be affected as a result of the proposal.\r\rIt is noted that the proposed rear elevation plan is not consistent whit other proposed plans.\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  It is considered that the proposed single storey rear extension would have an unacceptable adverse impact upon the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring property no 26 Highdown by reason of an overbearing appearance and sense of enclosure, given the rear building line of No 26.  This adjoining property benefits from the part single storey rear extension, the undeveloped part of the property adjoining the site address would be adversely affected by the scale and depth of the proposal. \r\rThe proposed development would have an impact on daylight in relation to adjoining properties, however it would meet BRE guidelines, passing the 45 degree in elevation view for both properties. \r",
