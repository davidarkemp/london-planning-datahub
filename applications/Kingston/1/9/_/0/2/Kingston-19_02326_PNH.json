    "There have been amendments to the nationally set planning application fee regulations. Regulation 14 of the regulations has been amended to introduce a fee of Â£96, payable for all Notification of larger home extension applications.\r\rYou have not paid the requisite fee and as such your application has been Refused.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Core Strategy, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably. However the amendments required to make the application acceptable are substantial and would materially change the development proposal.",
    "Inspection:\rSite inspection carried out as a desktop exercise due to COVID19 lockdown. Photos provided by the applicant as supporting material to application.\r\rAssessment:\rT.4 is a mature large specimen Ash suffering significant dieback and entering terminal decline. Chalara cannot be seen at present, but I would not rule out it's presence given the pattern of defoliation as observed. The tree is becoming hazardous and given it's location adjacent to communal gardens and neighbouring property gardens, it's removal is necessitated.\r\rRecommendation:\rApprove without requirement for a replacement to be planted due to site constraints."
