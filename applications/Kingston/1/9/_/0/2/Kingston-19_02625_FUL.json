    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwelling located on the southern side of Waters Road.\r\rThe site is not subject to any particular environmental contraints or policy designations.\r\r12 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations have been received. \r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings. \r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed single storey rear extension would not strictly comply with the recommendations set out in the Residential Design SPD 2013, in terms of depth, however, it would have an appropriate height and roof form, In any case, given that proposal could be constructed under planning ref: 21/02156/PAEXT, officers consider this to be a credible fall back position.\r\rThe proposed first floor rear extension would adhere to the recommendations set out in the Residential Design SPD, and as such is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development. \r\rWhile the proposed roof dormer would not strictly adhere to the recommendations set out in the Residential Design SPD, in terms of set in from the sides of the roof slope, given that the proposal benefits from permitted development rights, ref: 21/02140/CPU, officers consider this to be a credible fallback position, and in any case, given that it would be set up from the eaves and down from the ridge it would appear a proportionate addition to the host property and would not detract from the character of the area. \r\rThe proposed front porch extension is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development. \r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rOfficer Comment: Given the modest eaves height of the single storey rear extension, and siting of the proposed front porch, first floor rear extension and dormer in relation to the neighbouring properties, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance or loss of light.\r\rOfficers note that a number of openings are proposed at first and second floor level on the side elevation of the proposed development, as such to mitigate against any loss of privacy officers consider it appropriate to impose a condition to ensure that the openings related to bathrooms are obscure-glazed and non-opening at 1.7m above FFL.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
    "Application Site\rThe site comprises a mid-terraced dwelling located on the south eastern side of Barker Close.\r\rProposal\rErection of a single storey rear conservatory extension.\r\rConsultation\r2x neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations have been received.\r\rEnvironment Agency (Flood Risk)- We have assessed this application and it is covered by our Flood risk standing advice. \r\rAssessment\rOfficers note that Condition 12 imposed on planning permission 97/3406/FUL is relevant to this case and applies to properties in Barker Close:-\r\r\"Notwithstanding the provisions of Part 1 of Schedule 2 of the Town & Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order, 1995, or any Order revoking or re-enacting this Order) no extensions (including porches or dormer windows to the dwelling houses or buildings shall by erected within the curtilage.\r\rReason: to safeguard the privacy and amenity of adjoining occupiers, maintain adequate amenity space and safeguard the cohesive appearance of the development.\"\r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development; \r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings;\r-The impact of the proposed development on flood risk.\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed ground floor extension would be to the rear of the property. The proposed ground floor rear extension would have no impact on the streetscene and would also appear to be a subordinate and proportionate addition in relation to the host property. Officers also note a simialr extension to the rear of a nearby property on Barker Close and therefore the proposal in this case would unot appear wholly out of character with the immediate surrounding area.\r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed ground floor extension would project 3.0 metres to the rear of the host property and include a significant amount of glazing, including on the flank walls. In the event of an approval, it is considered that these flank windows should be finished in obscure glazing so as not to have an unacceptable impact on the neighbouring properties in terms of overlooking and or loss of privacy. Subject to this condition and given the siting of the proposed development in relation to neighbouring properties and its subordinate and proportionate nature, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of loss of privacy, overbearing appearance, or loss of light.\r\rOfficers note that the proposed ground floor extension would reduce the amount of private outdoor amenity space available to current and future occupiers of No. 6 Barker Close. Whilst this would be regrettable, Officers note that the existing garden would not be large enough to meet the requirements outlined in Policy Guidance 13 (Private Amenity Space) of the Residential Design SPD Adopted July 2013. Furthermore, Officers believe that the existing property is a small x2 bedroom house, therefore in this case it is considered that the amount of remaining amenity space would be sufficient and useable for the number of occupants at the property.\r\rFlood Risk\rPolicy SI12 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM4 of the Council's Core strategy 2012 require development proposals to accord with the flood risk policies set out in the NPPF.\r\rOfficer Comment: The application site falls within Flood Risk Zone 2 (medium probability). Consequently the Flood Risk Assessment: Standing Advice issued by the Environment Agency and DEFRA, 2012 must be applied. For minor extensions such as this it is essential that the proposed floor level is no lower than existing in order to mitigate future flood risk impacts. \r\rThe Flood Risk Assessment submitted by the applicant indicates that floor levels within the proposed development would be set no lower than the main dwelling and appropriate mitigation measures would be implemented as part of the proposed development which are considered acceptable and in accordance with Policy SI12 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM4 of the LDF Core Strategy (2012).\r\rIn conclusion and on balance, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
    "Site\rThe application site is a two-storey semi-detached dwellinghouse located on Villiers Road. The site is located within a Controlled Parking Zone and Flood Risk Zone 3 (high probability). \r\rConsultations\rFour neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations were received.\r\rConsideration\rThe key areas of assessment are: \rThe impact of the development on character and appearance; \rThe impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\rThe impact of the development on flood risk. \r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficers Comments: The application proposes the construction of a single storey rear extension. Policy Guidance 33 (Single Storey Rear Extensions)of the Residential Design SPD 2013 states that single storey rear extensions should be designed so that they appear proportionate and subordinate to the host building. In all cases, at least 50% of the rear garden should remain, extensions should generally not exceed 3m to 3.5m in depth, extensions with a pitched roof should not exceed 4m in height.\r\rThe proposed development would measure approximately 4 metres in depth from the rear wall of the existing dwellinghouse and would have a pitched roof which would measure approximately 3.9 metres to its ridge. Whilst the depth of the proposed extension would exceed the recommendations set out in the Residential Design SPD, the height would generally conform with its requirements. Therefore, overall the proposed extension would appear subordinate and proportionate in relation to the host dwelling. As the extension would be to the rear of the property, it would not be clearly visible from the street and the proposed development would also retain at least 50% of the rear garden space.  \r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficers Comments: It is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rPolicy SI12 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM4 of the Council's Core strategy 2012 require development proposals to accord with the flood risk policies set out in the NPPF. As stated above the site falls within Flood Risk Zone 3. Consequently the Flood Risk Assessment: Standing Advice issued by the Environment Agency and DEFRA, 2012 must be applied. For minor extensions such as this it is essential that the proposed floor level is no lower than existing in order to mitigate future flood risk impacts. \r\rThe applicant has indicated that the floor levels within the proposed development would be set no lower than existing levels and flood proofing of the proposed development has been incorporated where appropriate. The application is therefore acceptable in relation to flooding.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
