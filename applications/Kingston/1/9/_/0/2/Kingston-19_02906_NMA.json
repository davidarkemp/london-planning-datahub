    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwelling.\n\n4 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations have been received. \n\nThe key areas of assessment are: \n- The design of the proposed development; and,\n- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings. \n\nWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \n\nOfficer Comment: While the proposed single storey rear extension would not strictly accord with the parameters set out in the Residential Design SPD in terms of depth, the proposed development would have a modest height and as such officers consider that it would not appear out of scale with the original dwelling and its plot size.

    "--- Officer Report ---\n\nIntroduction\nThis application is of a nature where the Council's Constitution delegates the authority to make the decision to Officers rather than it being decided by a Committee of Councillors.  \n\nBefore preparing this summary report a Planning Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the relevant Development Plan policies and guidance, considered any relevant previous planning applications, and considered any comments made by those interested in the application such as consultees with specialist knowledge and nearby residents.\n \nBy indicating that the development proposal complies with relevant Development Plan policies, the planning officer is taking into account the information submitted with the application, any previous relevant applications, any comments received in connection with the application and any other case specific considerations which are material to the decision.\n\nThe Development Plan comprises:\n\nThe London Plan 2021;\nRBK Core Strategy 2012;\nKingston Town Centre Area Action Plan 2008; and,\nThe South London Waste Plan 2012.\n\nThis decision has been authorised by a Senior Officer (Authorising Officer) in the Development Management Service. Prior to endorsing the Planning Officer's recommendation, the Authorising Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the application documents, the relevant planning policies and guidance, any relevant history, and any representations received.\n\nApplication Site\nThe site comprises a residential dwelling.\n\nObjection\n\nAn objection has been received from a neighbouring occupier and the concerns summarised as follows:\n\n- Excessive height or bulk of buildings\n- Privacy\n\nOfficer comment\n\nThe proposal at the request of officers has been amended to reduce the size of the dormer, omit the full height windows and juliette balconies at the rear, the window in the dormer cheek and the lower front rooflight reduced in size and aligned with the other two front rooflights. The impact on the character and appearance of the host property and surrounding area and neighbouring amenity has been address in the assessment below.\n\nAssessment\nThe key areas of assessment are:\n- The design of the proposed development; and,\n- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\n\nDesign\nWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS) (2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \n\nOfficer Comment: The proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\n\nNeighbouring Amenities\nPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\n\nOfficer Comment:  It is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\n\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\n\nDetails of the Application Submission\nIn accordance with the requirements of Local Government Act 1972 details of the application submission were available on the Council's website during the assessment of the application.\n\nhttps://www.kingston.gov.uk/info/200155/planning_applications_and_permissions/263/find_a_planning_application_or_appeal\n\n--- Informatives ---\n\nPositive and Proactive\nIn dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way.  We have made available detailed advice in the form or our statutory policies in the Core Strategy, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably.\n\nBuilding Regulations\nYour attention is drawn to the need to comply with the relevant provisions of the Building Regulations, the Building Acts and other related legislation.  These cover such works as  - the demolition of existing buildings, the erection of a new building or structure, the extension or alteration to a building, change of use of buildings, installation of services, underpinning works, and fire safety/means of escape works.  Notice of intention to demolish existing buildings must be given to the Council's Building Control Service at least 6 weeks before work starts.  A completed application form together with detailed plans must be submitted for approval before any building work is commenced.\n\nParty Wall Act\nThe Party Wall Act 1996 requires a building owner to notify, and obtain formal agreement from, any adjoining owner, where the building owner proposes to:\n\n- carry out work to an existing party wall;\n- build on the boundary with a neighbouring property;\n- in some circumstances, carry out groundworks within 6 metres of an adjoining building.\n\nNotification and agreements under this Act are the responsibility of the building owner and are quite separate from Building Regulations, or Planning Controls.  The Building Control Service will assume that an applicant has obtained any necessary agreements with the adjoining owner, and nothing said or implied by the Council should be taken as removing the necessity for the building owner to comply fully with the Party Wall Act. Further information and advice is to be found in \"The Party Walls etc. Act 1996 - Explanatory Booklet\".\n\nProperty Boundaries\nYour attention is drawn to the fact that planning permission does not override property rights, and that if your proposal involves construction on or near the site boundary then you should take appropriate steps to ensure that you have correctly identified the position of the boundary, that you do not build over it, and that any works which affect a neighbours property in any way have the benefit of the appropriate agreement from that landowner. Failure to undertake the above steps may leave you liable to legal action by neighbouring landowners. If you require further information or advice, you should consult a solicitor.\n\nConsistency of Plans\nReasonable efforts have been made to check that the plans submitted for the purposes of this planning application are consistent from one to the next, and that the development hereby approved can be implemented in accordance with all of the plans submitted. Should it transpire that this is not possible and that your plans are flawed, please be clear that it may be impossible to implement this permission, and that any development undertaken which relies on this permission may be unauthorised and subject to enforcement action if expedient.\n\nConstruction Site Noise\nWhen undertaking demolition and/or noisy building work, please be considerate to your neighbours and do not undertake work before 8am or after 6pm Monday to Friday, before 8am or after 1pm on a Saturday or at any time on Sundays or Bank Holidays.  \n\nYou are advised that the Council does have formal powers to control noise and nuisance under The Control of Pollution Act 1974, the Clean Air Acts and other relevant legislation, and that any works undertaken which impact unreasonably upon the surrounding area may be subject to action by the Council's Environmental Health Department.\n\nDefinition of Approved in Writing\nWhere reference is made within the decision notice to a condition applying 'unless otherwise agreed in writing with the local planning authority', please be aware that only a formal application under section 73 or 96a of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (As Amended) is acceptable as a method of said written agreement.",
    "The description on your application refers to making a Non-Material Amendment however this application is made on a Variation of Condition Application (Approved Plans). Kindly confirm if you wish for this Section 73 Application for a minor material amendment (and amend your proposal) or if you wish to replace it with a Non-Material Application",
    "Please be advised that as part of the application site is a Listed Building, a Listed Building Application will be required, accompanied by a Heritage Statement"
