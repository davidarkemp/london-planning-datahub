    "Please provide a copies of block plan scaled 1:500 showing the proposed works (hatched or shaded) in relation to the existing dwelling, site boundaries and any outbuildings on site.  The block plan should also show adjoining properties to the side and rear and those opposite in full outline.\r\rPlease indicate where the fencing will be.",
    "Please provide copies of existing and proposed plans/elevations at a recognised scale of 1:50 or 1:100, providing a scale bar, and  key dimensions for the proposed works.\r\rPlease note that all plans need to scale correctly and the scale used to be stated on each plan. \r\r\r\r\r\r\r",

Furthermore, please ensure that all vehicles associated with the construction of the development hereby approved are properly washed and cleaned to prevent the passage of mud and dirt onto the adjoining highway. You are advised that the Council does have formal powers to control noise and nuisance under The Control of Pollution Act 1974, the Clean Air Acts and other relevant legislation.  For further information and advice, please contact - Environmental Health Department Pollution Section.",
    "Your attention is drawn to the fact that planning permission does not override property rights and any ancient rights of light that may exist.  This permission does not empower you to enter onto land not in your ownership without the specific consent of the owner.  If you require further information or advice, you should consult a solicitor.",
    "The Party Wall Act 1996 requires a building owner to notify, and obtain formal agreement from any adjoining owner, where the building owner proposes to carry out work to an existing party wall, build on the boundary with a neighbouring property or, in some circumstances, carry out groundworks within 6 metres of an adjoining building.\r\rNotification and agreements under this Act are the responsibility of the building owner and are quite separate from Building Regulations, or Planning Controls.  The Building Control Service will assume that an applicant has obtained any necessary agreements with the adjoining owner, and nothing said or implied by the Council should be taken as removing the necessity for the building owner to comply fully with the Party Wall Act. Further information and advice is to be found in \"The Party Walls etc. Act 1996 - Explanatory Booklet\".",
    "You are advised that with condition 17 requires the submission of a revised Construction management Plan prior to any commencement of development. As previously advised that submitted Construction Management Plan contains issues that will need to be fully addressed and resolved before starting any construction.\rIt is stated that 3 parking bays in Ewell Road will be suspended to provide for unloading/loading and temporary storage of materials and waste. This overlooks the fact that this side of Ewell Road has a bus lane that operates between 7.00 am to 10.00 am Monday to Saturday with corresponding loading restrictions during these hours. To suspend the bus lane and loading restriction would require the permission of the Local Highway Authority and London Buses. In view of the strategic nature of Ewell Road, this is highly unlikely to be granted without comprehensive traffic management measures being agreed.\rLoading/unloading arrangements would require goods and spoil to be moved across and along the footway of Ewell Road causing inconvenience, nuisance and potential danger to the public. This will require a detailed method statement of site management procedures. Any service connections across the footway and into the carriageway of Ewell Road will require careful traffic management measures.\rIt is stated that operatives/contractors must use local public car parks but none are available in the vicinity. The pay and display bays on Ewell Road have a maximum stay of 2 hours and those in the side roads off Ewell Road have a maximum stay of 4 hours. Therefore, the proposal to use these for all day operatives parking is impractical.\r",
    "This proposal may lead to disruption to users of the highway network in the Borough. Therefore, the applicant should contact the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames' New Roads and Street Works Section, (telephone 020 8547 5002). This must take place at least one month in advance of the works and is a requirement under the New Roads and Street Works Act 1991 and the Traffic management Act 2004 and in order to satisfy the licensing requirements of the Highways Act 1980.\r\r",
    "Inspection:\rSite inspection carried out on 26/02/2020\r\rAssessment:\rThe condition of the tree is not more than fair, with some dubious top cuts from previous works to reduce, leaving the tree trying to recover. The new works applied for should address this.\r\rRecommendation:\rApprove.\r",
    "Inspection:\rSite inspection carried out on 26/02/2020 Site conditions were good and the site was open.\r\rAssessment:\rThe condition of the two Ash trees was fair but they are groing in a position to compromise the structural embankments of the river. As they form part of a woodland TPO and fall under woodland management and given the restrictions of the site, the requirement to plant replacements is dispensed with in this instance.\r\rRecommendation:\rApprove.\r",
    "Inspection:\rSite inspection carried out on 26/02/2020 site conditions were good and the site was open.\r\rAssessment:\rThe trees in question are not visible from a public space and therefore not worthy of a TPO as they offer no public amenity. The Laurels do not constitute a tree.\r\rRecommendation:\rNo objections.\r",
    "Inspection:\rSite inspection carried out on 26/02/2020 site conditions were good and the site was open.\r\rAssessment:\rThese are repeat works that have become necessary for health and safety reasons due to the length of time since they were last carried out.\r\rRecommendation:\rApprove. \r",
    "Inspection:\rSite inspection carried out on 26/02/2020 site conditions were good and the tree was easily accessed on the site frontage.\r\rAssessment:\rThe tree is in excellent condition with strong regrowth since last works. The works now to repollard to the previous points are appropriate in order to continue managing the tree as a pollard and prevent damage from overgrowth and associated failure.\r\rRecommendation:\rApprove.\r",
