    "The development hereby permitted shall be commenced within 3 years from the date of this decision.\r\rReason: In order to comply with Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act, 1990.  (As amended)\r",
    "Notwithstanding the provisions of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (or any Order revoking or re-enacting this Order) no windows or other openings shall be formed in the northern flank wall of the building hereby approved without the prior written consent of the Local Planning Authority.\r\rReason: To protect the amenities and privacy of the occupiers of the adjoining residential properties in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r\r",
    "Notwithstanding the provisions of Part M of Schedule 2, Part 3 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 2015 (or any Order revoking or re-enacting this Order) and the Town and Country Planning (Use Classes) Order 1987 (as amended) the proposed single storey rear extension hereby permitted shall only be used for the purpose of a shop (Use Class A1), and for no other purposes, or any other Planning Use Classes.\r\rReason: To protect the amenities and privacy of the occupiers of the adjoining residential properties in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r",
    "The roof of the extension hereby permitted shall not be converted or used as a balcony or a sitting out area, and no access shall be gained except for maintenance purposes.\r\rReason: To protect the amenities and privacy of the adjoining residential properties in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r",
    "The facing materials to be used in the construction of the building shall be those specified on the application form and approved drawings or such other materials as have been approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority before the development is commenced and shall thereafter be retained as such.\r\rReason: To ensure a satisfactory appearance on completion of the development in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r",
    "It has been brought to the attention of the Council that there is a Sewer which crosses the application site. You should contact Thames Water to obtain their permission (a planning permission does not replace any other permission required for example a Building Over Agreement from Thames Water)\r\rhttps://developers.thameswater.co.uk/Domestic-and-small-commercial/Building-near-pipes/Building-over-or-near-a-sewer/Build-over-a-public-sewer-application/Apply-to-build-over-a-sewer",
    "Your attention is drawn to the fact that planning permission does not override property rights and any ancient rights of light that may exist. This permission does not empower you to enter onto land not in your ownership without the specific consent of the owner. If you require further information or advice, you should consult a solicitor. \r",
    "Your attention is drawn to the need to comply with the relevant provisions of the Building Regulations, the Building Acts and other related legislation. These cover such works as - the demolition of existing buildings, the erection of a new building or structure, the extension or alteration to a building, change of use of buildings, installation of services, underpinning works, and fire safety/means of escape works. Notice of intention to demolish existing buildings must be given to the Council's Building Control Service at least 6 weeks before work starts. A completed application form together with detailed plans must be submitted for approval before any building work is commenced. \r\r",
    "Reasonable efforts have been made to check that the plans submitted for the purposes of this planning application are consistent from one to the next, and that the development hereby approved can be implemented in accordance with all of the plans submitted. Should it transpire that this is not possible and that your plans are flawed, please be clear that it may be impossible to implement this permission, and that any development undertaken which relies on this permission may be unauthorised and subject to enforcement action.\r",
    "Section 59 of the Highways Act permits the Highway Authority to charge developers for damage caused by excessive weight and movements of vehicles to and from a site. The Highway Authority will pass on the cost of any excess repairs compared to normal maintenance costs to the applicant/organisation responsible for the damage. \r\r",
    "Please submit existing and proposed floor plans and elevations to scale 1:50 or 1:100, with the scale bar shown",
    "Please provide an Existing First Floor plan, to scale 1:50 or 1:100",
    "Please note that the submitted plans do not have scale bars on them, detailing the measured scale. Please also submit accurately copied plans, as the drawings are not shaped accurately to the paper sizes submiited",
    "Please can you amend your application form accordingly if the proposed works differ to how the original application was described. We are only in receipt of plans from yourself, and no correspondance on what the amendment is.",
    "Please be advised that whilst the replacement plans and elevations are now correct, the proposed block plan, still shows a side extension and not a rear extension. Kindly resubmit accordingly",
    "Inspection:\rSite inspection carried out as a desktop exercise with information provided by the applicant as supporting material to application.\r\rAssessment:\rMinor repeat works with no adverse impact upon tree health or amenity.\r\rRecommendation:\rNo objections.",
    "Application withdrawn by agent in agreement with Council given that works are exempt from application or notification.",
    "Inspection:\rSite inspection carried out as a desktop exercise with information provided by the applicant as supporting material to application.\r\rAssessment:\rThis is a duplicate application with 24/00620/TCA for the same work but seemingly made by an alterante insurance group. Normally such an application would be withdrawn on the basis of not issuing a repeat decision and thereby accidentally duplicating the permitted works. But in this instance as it is for removal of the tree and by 2 different firms, there is no harm in the Borough issuing permission to both on the basis of the below assesment which stands for both:\r\rThe trees to be removed are not responsible for causing subsidence as suggested by the submission of subsidence related evidence. The only roots found in the borehole samples taken at the zone of influence are those os Sambucus (elder-a small shrub or bush), the Eucalyptus are both at the far end of the large rear garden and their roots were not found. On this basis the application is being made as a knee jerk reaction by the insurance group. However, given that the Eucalyptus are not visible to the public and therefore not contributing to public amenity, they are unworthy of the service of a TPO and the Council default response should simply be that of no objection as if the application had been made without the association with subsidence in which instance a decision of no objection would likewise have been appropriate.\r\rRecommendation:\rNo Objection.",
    "Inspection:\rSite inspection carried out as a desktop exercise with information provided by the applicant as supporting material to application.\r\rAssessment:\rSmall deformed unhealthy tree to rear of property and causing structural damage. No adverse impact upon amenity.\r\rRecommendation:\rNo objections."
