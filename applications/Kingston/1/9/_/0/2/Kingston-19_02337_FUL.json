    "Inspection:\rSite inspection carried out in person on 11/01/2024.\r\rAssessment:\rI'm unsure why the Agent applied for the removal of sucker growth as there is none, but the during my site visit I inspected the tree against the scope of works in the application and ammended the description of works to reflect the spirit of the application as well as the needs of the tree and the works as now described will not have a positive impact upon the trees health and will not affect it's public amenity contribution.\r\rRecommendation:\rApprove.",
    "Inspection:\rSite inspection carried out in person on 11/01/2024.\r\rAssessment:\rNo visit was possible but the works are minor in scope and all works have historically been conducted in a sympathetic manner by the owner previously. Furthermore the works will not have a negative impact upon tree health or public amenity as they are not really visible to the public and the works are simply repeat works of those carried out in the past to trees I know from regular visits over the years.\r\rRecommendation:\rApprove.",
    "Inspection:\rSite inspection carried out in person on 11/01/2024.\r\rAssessment:\rThe works required are for the removal of a major Oak which has been failing now for approx 10 years and has reached a point of decline where it is no longer safe to be retained given it's location over a high target area within the School grounds, the reduction of a second large Oak which has a major cavity at it's base and needs careful management to prevent failure and the sympathetic reduction of a large Lime. I visited and inspected in person at which time I was able to verify all of the tree conditions as posed by the agent in the application.\r\rRecommendation:\rApprove.",

    "Inspection:\rSite inspection carried out in person on 10/11/2023.\r\rAssessment:\rAppropriate and necessary works to prevent failure given the significant weight of regrowth placing stress on a basal union.\r\rRecommendation:\rApprove.",

    "Inspection:\rSite inspection carried out in person on 11/01/2024.\r\rAssessment:\rThe below excerpt from the application is a copy of the email that I sent to the land owner following my site visit-\r\r\"Given that your Tree Surgeon had said they were healthy not too long ago, I was surprised to find that they were in a very poor state. Certainly their condition has not been what I would call safe for a year or more on the basis of the advanced decay that I found which takes time to form. I had of course advised you to get an aerial inspection conducted and a report written, but in this instance I was able to verify the tree's condition from ground level by carrying out a simple knock test. This showed that 7 of the 8 trees were significantly decayed at the base, with major cavities in the main stems spreading from a height above 2m down to the base and into the buttress roots rendering them structurally unsound and at significant risk of further wind throw and failure. The eighth tree stands alone and is younger than the remainder of the group and thus smaller and thinner, but despite being younger evidence of decay was still present though at an earlier stage. Given the exposed state that this tree would be left in following the removal of the other trees though, and its position as one of the trees closest to the adjacent houses with that elevated risk, it is arboriculturaly justifiable to remove this tree also.\r\rOn these grounds I would like to invite you to make an application to the Council for the removal of all 8 Poplars to be replanted with a different species in the autumn of this year to be specified in the decision notice.\"\r\rRecommendation:\rApprove with condition for replacement planting.",
