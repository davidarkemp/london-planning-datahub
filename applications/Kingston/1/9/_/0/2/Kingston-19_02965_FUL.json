    "Development  shall  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  the  materials  specified  on  the approved plans and on the application form unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority.\r\rReason: To ensure a satisfactory appearance on completion of the development in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r",
    "The development hereby permitted shall begin before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.\r\rReason: This is required by Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990.",
    "The development to which this permission relates shall be carried out in strict accordance with the approved outline delivery and service management plan. After the approved use has been operational for six months, a survey of delivery and servicing activities shall be carried out. \r\rWithin one year of the approved use commencing, a revised Delivery Servicing Plan (which considers the information gathered from surveys and makes necessary amendments to the outline Delivery Servicing Plan) shall be submitted to the Council within one year of operations commencing on site. Thereafter the delivery and servicing operations shall be continuously monitored and revisions made to the plan as necessary.\r\rReason: In the interests of the safety and operation of the highway network, in accordance with policies 6.3 of the London Plan 2016 and policies CS6 and DM8 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "No music or other amplified sound shall be played within the premises so as to be audible from the nearest residential premises. \r\rReason: To ensure satisfactory living conditions for neighbouring occupiers, in accordance with policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "Prior to beneficial occupation of the development to which this permission relates, the extraction/ventilation systems shown on the approved plans shall be installed and permanently retained thereafter.\r\rReason: To ensure satisfactory living conditions for neighbouring occupiers, in accordance with policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The rating level of the noise determined by the cumulative sound emissions of the plant to which this permission relates shall be at least 5dBA lower than the existing background noise level at any given time of operation. The noise levels shall be measured or predicted 1m externally to any window at the nearest residential facade and the measurements and assessment shall be made according to BS 4142:2014.\r\rReason: To ensure satisfactory living conditions for neighbouring occupiers, in accordance with policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "Refuse storage facilities and recycling facilities shall be provided prior to the beneficial occupation of the development hereby permitted in accordance with details which shall have been previously submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority, the approved facilities shall be permanently retained at the site. The developer and/or their successors in title shall ensure that all refuse and recyclable materials associated with the development shall either be stored within this dedicated store/area as shown on the approved plans, or internally within the building(s) that form part of the application site, and that no refuse or recycling material shall be stored or placed for collection on the public highway or pavement, except on the day of collection.\r\rReason: To ensure the provision of refuse facilities to the satisfaction of the Council in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.",
    "The restaurant use to which this permission relates shall not open outside of the following hours:\r\r08:00 to 23:00 Monday to Friday\r08:00 to 23:00 on Saturdays\r09:00 to 22:00 on Sundays and bank holidays\r\rReason: To ensure satisfactory living conditions for neighbouring occupiers, in accordance with policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The site comprises an end of terrace dwelling.\r\r5 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and 1 objection has been received relating to privacy. The concerns raised will be taken into consideration during the assessment of the application and detailed below.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings. \r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development. \r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rOfficer Comment: Given the modest scale and siting of the proposed development in relation to the neighbouring properties there would be no adverse affect to the amenities of the  occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance or loss of sunlight/light. \r\rWhile two openings are proposed to the side elevation of the applicant's property at ground level, and would be facing neighbouring property No. 9 Hemsby Road, given the separation distance and existing boundary treatment, there would be no adverse impact in terms of loss of privacy. Further, given that no openings are proposed to the side elevation facing neighbouring property No. 5 Hemsby Road there would be no loss of privacy as a result of the proposed development. However, it is considered reasonable to attach a condition to any grant of planning permission to prevent any future insertion of windows in the side elevations of the first floor extension. The proposed development would comply with BRE guidelines in terms of loss of light to neighbouring properties.\r\rTherefore, It is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. \r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).\r",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way.  We have made available detailed advice in the form or our statutory policies in the Core Strategy, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably.",
    "It is highlighted that any proposed works will result in substantial movement of heavy vehicles on the highways, and therefore the Council will require the applicant to undertake a road and footway condition survey before construction begins. This will take the form of a joint inspection with a member of the Street Scene Team and will involve a photographic record and visual observation of the roads, verges and margins.",
    "Reasonable efforts have been made to check that the plans submitted for the purposes of this planning application are consistent from one to the next, and that the development hereby approved can be implemented in accordance with all of the plans submitted. Should it transpire that this is not possible and that your plans are flawed, please be clear that it may be impossible to implement this permission, and that any development undertaken which relies on this permission may be unauthorised and subject to enforcement action.",
    "Your attention is drawn to the fact that planning permission does not override property rights and any ancient rights of light that may exist. This permission does not empower you to enter onto land not in your ownership without the specific consent of the owner. If you require further information or advice, you should consult a solicitor.",
    "The development approved by this planning permission will be liable to pay the Mayor of London's Community Infrastructure Levy (MCIL). Payment will be due once the owner/developer serves a development Commencement Notice on the Council, and a payment Demand Notice has been received by the owner. Failure to submit a Commencement Notice will incur a surcharge of 20% of the chargeable amount or £2,500, whichever is the lower amount.",

    "Please provide a copy of proposed block plan scaled 1:500 showing the proposed works (hatched or shaded) in relation to the existing dwelling, site boundaries and any outbuildings on site.  The block plan should also show adjoining properties to the side and rear and those opposite in full outline.\r\rThe submitted block plan and site plan does not show adjoining properties to the side and rear and those opposite in full outline.\r",
