Given the site constraints it would not be suitable to impose a condition for replanting which would likely then cause the same issues to resurface at a later date. Also it is worth noting that T.2 is an unprotected tree.\r\rRecommendation:\rApprove.",

The tree is confirmed as healthy by the Agent who inspected it.\r\rRecommendation:\rRefuse and grant consent for lesser works as follows:\r\rT.1 Pine - Prune back the lateral branches over the garage to re-balance the crown by 1.5-2m."
