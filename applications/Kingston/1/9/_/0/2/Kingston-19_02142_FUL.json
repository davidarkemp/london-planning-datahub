    "Site\r\rThe application site is a two-storey semi-detached dwellinghouse located on The Ridings. The site is not subject to any particular designations or environmental constraints.\r\rPlanning History\r\r11768 - Extension and erect garage. Conditional Approval. \r\r22/00523/CPU - Demolition of existing garage and rear conservatory and erection of single storey side and rear extension. Refused. \r\rConsultations\r\r6 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations were received.\r\rConsideration\r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \rThe impact of the development on character and appearance. \rThe impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\rThe impact of the development on highways. \rThe impact of the development on fire safety. \r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficers Comments: The application proposes the construction of a single storey side and rear extension. Officers consider that the proposed development would appear proportionate and subordinate to the dwellinghouse, which would relate well to its design. Whilst it is not ideal that the proposed extension would encroach on the cill height of the windows of the first floor, Officers consider that the proposed development would still largely have an acceptable impact on the character and appearance of the dwellinghouse and area. \r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficers Comments:  It is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rPolicy T6 of the London Plan 2021 states that car parking should be restricted in line with levels of existing and future public transport accessibility and connectivity. The maximum standards as set out in policies T6.1 to T6.5 should be applied to development proposals.\r\rPolicy DM9 of the Council's LDF Core Strategy (2012) states that new development must comply with local car parking standards in order that it does not contribute to congestion or compromise highway safety. Policy DM10 supports this stance.\r\rOfficers Comments: The proposal would lead to the removal of an existing garage. To accommodate modern vehicles, proposed new garages should meet the required dimensions as recommended by Appendix 5 of the Sustainable Transport SPD, measuring 3 metres in width and 5.3 metres in depth internally. The existing garage would not meet the minimum required internal garage dimensions for one vehicle, and therefore the removal of this garage would not impact the parking provision on site. \r\rFurthermore, it is considered that the remaining hardstanding is of an adequate size to accommodate two off-street car parking spaces. Whilst this level of provision would be in excess of the maximum standards set out in the London Plan, this issue would not warrant a reason for refusal as it is reflective of the existing situation. \r\rPolicy T5 of the London Plan 2021 states that developments should provide cycle parking at least in accordance with the minimum standards set out in Table 10.2 and Figure 10.3. \r\rOfficers Comments: The proposal would result in a loss of access to the rear as well as the loss of a garage. Officers therefore consider it appropriate to attach a condition to the application in the event of an approval for the applicant to provide details of secure onsite cycle parking. \r\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",

    "Application Site\rThe site comprises a semi-detached dwelling.\r\rProposal\rErection of single-storey side extension\r\rConsultation\rEight neighbouring properties have been notified and no representations have been received.\r\rAssessment\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; \r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\r- Fire Safety.\r\rDesign\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment:Policy Guidance 35 (Single Storey Side Extensions) states that the following guidance should be followed when designing a single storey rear extension:\r- The roof of the extension should reflect and relate well to the main house and its roof form, and the height of the roof should never encroach on the sill of windows of the second storey.\r- The extension should remain proportionate and subordinate to the original house, so that in general, the width of the extension does not exceed 50% of that of the original house.\r- Side extensions should normally be set-back from the front wall of the original house by at least 500mm.\r- Features such as doors and windows on the new extension should relate to those on the original house.\r- Side extensions to semi-detached dwellings should respect the symmetry of the adjoining semi-detached property.\r\rThe proposed side extension has not been set back from the front wall and would not respect the symmetry of the adjoining property. It is therefore considered that there would be an unacceptable adverse impact on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposals.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  The principal properties to consider in relation to neighbouring amenity are No. 17 and No. 21 Kneller Road. Due to the location of the proposed development it is unlikely to cause any harm to No. 17 Kneller Road. With regards to No. 21, officer not there are not proposed windows to flank elevation facing towards No. 21. Officers therefore consider that due to its limited height, the proposed development will not cause loss of light or privacy. It is therefore considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rFire Safety \rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be contrary to the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.",
    "Consultations\r27no. surrounding properties were notified of the proposed development. Four representations received (however two are dismissed as repeat objections). The representations object to the proposals with concerns as follows:\r\r-\tPrinciple of conversion to smaller homes\r-\tCar parking as proposed would be impractical\r-\tConcerns regarding bin storage for the proposed development\r\rOfficer comment: Duly noted. Please refer to body of the report for detailed assessment of the proposals.\r\rRBK Highways and Transportation Team\rNo response received.\rRBK Waste and Recycling Team\rNo response received.\rRBK Policy Team\rNo response received.\r\rProposal\rThis application seeks full planning permission for the conversion of semi-detached four-bedroom house into a three-bedroom house and a two-bedroom annex, with associated amenity space. \r\rSite and Surroundings\rThe application site is located on the eastern side of Raeburn Avenue, Tolworth. The site is occupied by a two-storey, four-bedroom semi-detached dwellinghouse with attached garage along the northern boundary. There is a modest two-storey side extension on the northern elevation. \r\rThe site is not located in a conservation area and the buildings and curtilage are not statutory or locally listed.\r\rPlanning History\r22/00634/FUL - Conversion of existing detached 4 bedroom dwelling  into 2no.x maisonettes (1no.x 3 bedroom and 1no.x 2 bedroom) with garden space. Refused planning permission, dated 27 April, 2022 for the following reasons:\r\r1.\tThe applicant has failed to provide sufficient information / evidence to demonstrate that the proposed development would meet the required floor to ceiling height across the proposed accommodation in line with internal space standards, set out in the London Plan 2021, as such, Officers are not able to conclude that the development would provide a good standard of internal accommodation for future residents. As such, the proposal would be contrary to Policy DM10 of the RBK Core Strategy 2012 and Policy D6 of the London Plan, 2021.\r\r2.\tThe proposed accommodation would fail to comply with the minimum internal space standards in terms of built in storage space for 2no. two-storey, 2-bedroom flats set out in Table 3.1 of Policy D6 of the London Plan, 2021.\r\r3.\tThe applicant has failed to provide sufficient information to demonstrate that the rear garden areas would meet Council's required standards relating to amenity space, contrary to Policy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy, 2012 and Policy Guidance 13 of the Council's Residential Design SPD, 2013.\r\r4.\tThe proposed development would have an overprovision of parking and this is likely to lead to increased vehicle movement that could exacerbate existing congestion levels on the local highway network and prejudice highway safety. Therefore the proposal would not accord with Policies DM9 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy 2012.\r\r5.\tThe proposed development would not provide the required minimum quantum of cycle spaces to adequately serve the development and, as such, would be contrary to Policy T5 of the London Plan, 2021.\r\r6.\tThe proposals would result in the loss of 3-bedroom accommodation, suitable for family occupation, at a time when the Strategic Housing Market Assessment 2016 identifies a significant need for such accommodation in the Borough. The proposals are therefore found to be contrary to RBK Strategic Housing Market Assessment 2016 and Policy DM13 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames LDF Core Strategy, April 2012.\r\rPlanning Considerations\rThe key planning considerations in this case are as follows:\r- The principle of the development;\r- The standard of accommodation;\r- The character and appearance of the area;\r- The amenities of neighbouring occupiers;\r- Transportation; \r- Refuse and recycling; and \r- Fire Safety\r\rPrinciple of Development\rPolicy CS10 of the Council's LDF Core Strategy, 2012 sets out the Borough's housing targets as defined by the London Plan, 2011.  Policy H1 (Increasing Housing Supply) of the London Plan (2021) sets ten-year targets for net housing completions that each local planning authority should plan for. Table 4.1 sets out the 10 year targets for net housing completions in each London Borough from 2019/20 - 2028/29). The requirement for Kingston is to deliver 9,640 homes in this 10 year period, which would equate to 964 net completions per annum.\r\rAs there is no 5-year housing land supply, paragraph 11 of the NPPF indicates that planning permission should be granted unless (i) the application of policies in this Framework that protect areas or assets of particular importance provides a clear reason for refusing the development proposed; or (ii) any adverse impacts of doing so significantly and demonstrably outweigh the benefits, when assessed against policies in this Framework taken as a whole.  These considerations should be given considerable weight in the assessment of any forthcoming planning application.\r\rWhilst it is recognised that the Council does not have an up-to-date supply of housing sites, the benefits of the proposed development would need to be weighed against any significant adverse impacts, as required by paragraph 11 of the NPPF.\rThe site is in an established residential area and its use for residential purposes is well established. The principle of creating a new residential unit within an established residential area is acceptable, subject to compliance with Development Plan policies.\r\rStandard of Accommodation\rParagraph 130 of the NPPF, 2021 states that planning decisions should ensure that developments will create places that are safe, inclusive and accessible and which promote health and well-being, with a high standard of amenity for existing and future users.\r\rPolicy D6 of the London Plan, 2021 sets out the standards for new housing within London, in terms of overall gross internal area (\"GIA\"), built-in storage space, bedroom sizes and ceiling heights. Housing development should be of high quality design and provide adequately-sized rooms, with comfortable and functional layouts which are fit for purpose and meet the needs of Londoners without differentiating between tenures. Policy DM13 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 states that the Council will expect proposals for new residential development to demonstrate that the scheme has been designed to provide adequate internal space appropriate to the intended number of occupants. \r\rGIA\rThe nationally described space standard provides overall gross internal area (\"GIA\") requirements for various sizes of dwelling. The proposals show the accommodation to comprise of 2no. self-contained flats. One flat is labelled as a 2-bedroom, 3-person flat and the other is labelled as a 3-bedroom, 5-person flat.\r\rHowever, the larger flat shown as a 3-bedroom unit (labelled as No. 40) would not, in fact, be counted as a 3-bedroom flat in planning terms given that the small front room to the first floor labelled as a bedroom / study would measure to 6sqm and, therefore, not comply with the minimum space standards for a single bedroom. Also, the smaller flat shown as a 2-bedroom, 3-person flat would similarly not be counted as a 2-bedroom unit given that the small, irregular shaped front room labelled as a single bedroom/study would not comply with minimum space standards (including minimum width requirements for a single bedroom).\r\rOfficers would reclassify the proposals as comprising of 1no. one-bedroom, 2-person unit and 1no. two-bedroom, 4-person unit. \r\rAccording to the standards, dwellings of these sizes arranged over two floors should have a minimum GIA of 58sqm and 79sqm, respectively. \r\rThe proposed dwellings would present accommodation above the minimum space standards, providing a total floor area of approximately 73sqm and 120sqm, respectively. \r\rBuilt-In Storage\rThe standard also provides requirements for built-in storage space. The corresponding minimum standard for storage is 2.0sqm. The proposed dwellings would meet this requirement.\r\rBedrooms\rIn order to provide one bed space, a single bedroom should have a floor area of at least 7.5sqm and be at least 2.15m wide and in order to provide two bed spaces, a double (or twin) bedroom should have a floor area of at least 11.5sqm.\r\rOne double (or twin) bedroom should be at least 2.75m wide, with every other such bedroom being at least 2.55m wide. \r\rNotwithstanding the small front bedroom to the ground floor (which is discussed above) and which would fail to meet the width requirements for a single bedroom (at 1.9m at its widest, tapering to 1.3m), and the small front bedroom to the first floor measuring 6sqm, all of the double-sized bedrooms would comply with minimum space standards.\r\rCeiling Height\rAny dwelling should also have a floor to ceiling height of at least 2.5m across 75% of its floor area, in recognition of the fact that ceiling heights are an important element in the design of a dwelling in the unique circumstances of London.\r\rHigher ceilings can help to offset issues associated with London's distinct higher densities and the effects of climate change by positively impacting on how spacious, light and comfortable the dwelling is. They can also improve the amount and quality of natural light and ventilation, and provide flexibility in the use of a room.\r\rThe applicant has annotated the floorplans to state that the ground floor has a floor to ceiling height of 2.4m and the first floor has a floor to ceiling height of 2.3m. As such, 75% of the floorspace of the accommodation would not have a floor to ceiling height of 2.5m, contrary to Policy D6 of the London Plan, 2021.\r\rAspect, Outlook, Lighting and Ventilation\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy requires that developments have regard to the amenities of occupants in terms of outlook.\r\rStandard 29 of the Mayor's Housing SPG 2016 states that developments should minimise the number of single aspect dwellings. Single aspect dwellings that are north facing, or exposed to noise levels above which significant adverse effects on health and quality of life occur, or which contain three or more bedrooms should be avoided.\r\rThe subtext to Policy D6 of the London Plan, 2021 goes onto say that dual aspect dwellings with opening windows on at least two sides have many inherent benefits. These include better daylight, a greater chance of direct sunlight for longer periods, natural cross ventilation and a greater capacity to address overheating, mitigating pollution, offering a choice of views, access to a quiet side of the building, greater flexibility in the use of rooms, and more potential for future adaptability by altering the use of rooms. Where possible, the provision of dual aspect dwellings should be maximised in a development proposal.\r\rThe proposed dwellings would be dual aspect with windows provided to the front (west) and rear (east) elevations. Officers consider that the proposed dwellings would be afforded sufficient natural light, good outlook and ventilation for the size of dwelling, commensurate with other dwellings along Raeburn Avenue. \r\rOutdoor Space\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy requires developments to ensure adequate private and/or communal amenity space.\r\rPolicy Guidance 13 of the Council's Residential Design SPD 2013 states that although levels of private amenity space may vary considerably in different character areas, each new dwelling should have 50m2 of private outdoor space (plus an extra 5m2 for each bedroom after the third).\r\rThe proposed plans indicate that each dwelling would be provided with private external rear garden space. The submitted proposed site plan is annotated to demonstrate that each unit would be provided well in excess of Council's minimum standards for external amenity space. \r\rOverall\rThe layout of the accommodation is considered to represent logical internal floor space with good light, outlook and ventilation. However, whilst the proposed dwelling would meet the requirements of the nationally described space standards in terms of internal living accommodation, the ceiling heights would not meet the required standards. On this basis, Officers are not satisfied that the proposed dwelling would provide for a high quality overall standard of internal living accommodation for future occupiers. \r\rCharacter and Appearance\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS) (2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rPolicy D3 (Optimising Site Capacity Through the Design-Led Approach) of the London Plan (2021) sets out that all development must make the best use of land by following a design-led approach that optimises the capacity of sites. Development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions. Spaces and buildings should maximise opportunities for urban greening to create attractive resilient places that can also help the management of surface water.\r\rAccordingly, Policy CS8 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 states the Council's intention to protect the primarily suburban character of the Borough, its existing buildings and areas of high quality and historic interest from inappropriate development. The Council will seek opportunities for sensitive enhancement in these areas and in areas of poorer environmental quality, where character has been eroded or needs improving. The assessment of development proposals will be guided by the Borough Character Study and the Residential Design SPD, ensuring that new development:\r- Recognises distinctive local features and character\r- Has regard to the historic and natural environment\r- Helps enhance locally distinctive places of high architectural and urban design quality\r- Accords with neighbourhood \"strategies for delivery\" set out under \"Character, Design and Heritage\"\r- Relates well and connects to its surroundings Policy DM10 identifies the most essential elements in contributing to the character and local distinctiveness of a street or area which should be respected, maintained or enhanced. These include:\r- Prevailing development typology, including housing types, sizes and occupancy\r- Prevailing density of the surrounding area\r- Scale, layout, height, form (including roof forms) and massing\r- Landscape setting and features\r- Plot width and format, which includes spaces between buildings\r- Building line build-up, set-back and front boundary\r- Typical details and key features such as roof forms, window format, building materials and design detailing of elevations, existence of grass verges, etc.\r\rThis application does not propose any external changes in the form of extensions/additions. All of the proposed changes relate to the internal accommodation. \r\rThe proposal would have an acceptable impact on the character and appearance of the area.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rParagraph 130 of the NPPF 2021 states that planning decisions should ensure that developments will create places that are safe, inclusive and accessible and which promote health and well-being, with a high standard of amenity for existing and future users.\r\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan (2021) requires new development to deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity. Policy DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012) is clear that development proposals should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rPolicy Guidance 16 of the Council's Residential Design SPD 2013 considers neighbouring amenities in more detail. It states that for all new residential development (including conversions and changes of use), the priority should be to provide and protect acceptable levels of amenity for both existing and future residents. On smaller sites, the prevailing character of the area may dictate what separation distance will be but in general, minimum separation distances should be maintained using the following standards:\r- A separation distance of no less than 21m shall normally be maintained between facing windows of habitable rooms\r- A separation distance of 7.5m shall be maintained between new habitable room windows and the boundary to neighbouring properties or 15m between new habitable room windows and the flank wall of a neighbouring property\r- Where the site topology, landscape features or adequate screening is in place it may be appropriate to relax these distances\r- In all cases, developers should demonstrate, through a design and access statement, how adequate visual and acoustic privacy will be achieved - consistent with the Mayor's Housing SPG paras 2.3.30/Standard 5.1.1 \r\rThe proposed development by virtue of its size, siting and design in relation to the neighbouring properties would not cause any significant material harm to the outlook, daylight/sunlight provision or privacy of the neighbouring occupiers.\r\rTransport\rParagraph 110 of the NPPF 2021 requires that in assessing applications for development, it is ensured that: appropriate opportunities to promote sustainable transport modes can be - or have been - taken up; safe and suitable access to the site can be achieved for all users; the design of streets, parking areas, other transport elements and the content  of associated standards reflects current national guidance, including the National Design Guide and the National Model Design Code; and any significant impacts from the development on the transport network (in terms of capacity and congestion), or on highway safety, can be cost effectively mitigated to an acceptable degree.\r\rParagraph 111 goes on to say that development should only be prevented or refused on highways grounds if there would be an unacceptable impact on highway safety, or the residual cumulative impacts on the road network would be severe.\r\rParagraph 112 says that applications should give priority first to pedestrian and cycle movements, both within the scheme and in neighbouring areas, and second to facilitating access to high quality public transport, with layouts that maximise the catchment area for such services. They should also: address the needs of people with disabilities and reduced mobility; create places that are safe, secure and attractive, which minimise the scope for conflicts between pedestrians, cyclists and vehicles; allow for the efficient delivery of goods and access by service and emergency vehicles; and be designed to enable charging of ultra-low emission vehicles in safe, accessible and convenient locations.\r\rPolicy T4 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should reflect and be integrated with current and planned transport access, capacity and connectivity. Where appropriate, mitigation, either through direct provision of public transport, walking and cycling facilities and highways improvements or through financial contributions, will be required to address adverse transport impacts that are identified. Development proposals should not increase road danger.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 states that development proposals should have regard to local traffic conditions and highway safety and ensure they are not adversely affected.\r\rAccess\rThe vehicular access to the site would remain as existing and it is not considered that its use would materially intensify. \r\rOfficers are therefore satisfied that the proposal would have an acceptable impact on highway safety.\r\rCar Parking\rPolicy T6 of the London Plan 2021 states that car parking should be restricted in line with levels of existing and future public transport accessibility and connectivity. Car-free development should be the starting point for all development proposals in places that are (or are planned to be) well-connected by public transport, with developments elsewhere designed to provide the minimum necessary parking ('car-lite').\r\rThe maximum standards as set out in policies T6.1 to T6.5 should be applied to development proposals. Where provided, each motorcycle parking space should count towards the maximum for car parking spaces at all use classes.\r\rPolicy CS7 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 sets out the Council's intention to manage on and off-street parking provision to promote sustainability and residential amenities.\r\rPolicy DM9, Policy DM10 and the Council's Sustainable Transport SPD 2013 together require development proposals to comply with the car parking standards in the London Plan.\r\rThe site has a public transport accessibility level (PTAL) rating of 2, which represents a poor level of accessibility by means of public transport. Policy 6.1 within Table 10.3 of the London Plan 2021 requires the proposed development to have a maximum of 0.75 car parking spaces per 2-bedroom dwelling - this would equate to 1.5 spaces.\r\rThe application site currently provides off-street car parking for 2no. vehicles. The existing garage is not capable of accommodating modern standard vehicles. The proposals provide for 3no. car parking spaces to serve the proposed dwellings to its frontage. As such, there would be a net increase to the total amount of off-street car parking which would be contrary to sustainable transport principles in national and regional planning and would not be acceptable. Officers also raise concerns that the front forecourt would not provide the necessary space to be able to safely manoeuvre / park 3no. cars as well as cycle storage and refuse/recycling store to serve the proposed development and would result in impractical/visually cluttered frontage. \r\rCycle Parking\rPolicy T5 of the London Plan, 2021 states that developments should provide cycle parking at least in accordance with the minimum standards set out in Table 10.2 and Figure 10.3, ensuring that a minimum of two short-stay and two long-stay cycle parking spaces are provided where the application of the minimum standards would result in a lower provision. Cycle parking should be designed and laid out in accordance with the guidance contained in the London Cycling Design Standards.\r\rDevelopment proposals should demonstrate how cycle parking facilities will cater for larger cycles, including adapted cycles for disabled people.\r\rApplying Table 10.2 to the proposal results in a requirement for a minimum of 2no. cycle parking spaces per dwelling (i.e. total of 4no. cycle spaces). The application proposes 3no. cycle spaces be provided to the front of the proposed dwelling. This would not be an appropriate quantum of provision to serve the proposed development, contrary to Policy T5 of the London Plan, 2021.\r\rRefuse and Recycling\rPolicy CS9 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 requires integrated, well-designed recycling facilities to be incorporated into all new developments.\r\rPolicy Guidance 22 of the Council's Residential Design SPD 2013 provides further guidance on this matter, stating that the storage of waste facilities should be integral to the design of dwellings and located so that they can be accessed conveniently for residents. Ideally, they should be to the rear of the property, provided that a route between the front and rear of the property can be provided that does not go through the house.\r\rThe plans show that the waste and recycling bins will be stored within the front forecourt to the application site. A pre-commencement condition would have been recommended should the recommendation be for approval, to ensure that these bins are contained within suitably high-quality, ventilated enclosure(s) and details submitted to the local planning authority for assessment and approval. However, as aforementioned, Officers raise concerns that there would not be the necessary space to the frontage to suitably store refuse/recycling, as well as cycles and 3no. car spaces.\r\rConclusion / Planning Balance \rParagraph 11 of the NPPF states that where there are no relevant development plan policies, or the policies which are most important for determining the application are out-of-date, the Council should grant planning permission unless:\r- the application of policies in this Framework that protect areas or assets of particular importance provides a clear reason for refusing the development proposed or; \r- any adverse impacts of doing so would significantly and demonstrably outweigh the benefits, when assessed against the policies in this Framework taken as a whole. \r\rSignificant weight is given in the assessment of the proposals providing for one net additional residential dwellinghouse. \r\rOfficers find that the proposed development would provide for good quality living accommodation in terms of floorspace. However, Officers find that the proposed development would provide for poor living accommodation for future occupiers of the property, in terms of ceiling heights. \r\rThe proposals have been assessed as acceptable in terms of impact to the character and appearance of the host dwelling and area and impact to neighbouring amenity. These are given neutral weighting.\r\rThe proposed level of parking represents an overprovision that would encourage vehicle use. In turn, this could lead to increased vehicle movement that could exacerbate existing congestion levels on the local highway network and prejudice highway safety. Therefore, the proposed development would be in conflict with Policy DM9 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012 and fails to align with sustainable transport planning policies. Officers give significant weighting to this in the overall assessment of the proposals.\r\rIn addition, the proposals are found to provide insufficient cycle parking provision to the required minimum standards to properly encourage sustainable modes of transport to future occupiers of the proposed development. This is given moderate weighting against the proposals in the overall assessment. \r\rAdditionally, Officers consider it worth noting that although presented/labelled as a 3-bed unit and a 2-bed unit, it has been found that the proposals do not actually meet the space standards (specifically in relation to the single bedrooms to each unit) to qualify as such sized dwellings. Officers therefore reclassify the proposals as constituting 1x 1-bed unit and 1x 2bed unit.\r\rThe proposals would result in the loss of a family-sized dwelling, which would not be replaced in the proposed mix (given that the labelled 3-bedroom unit would not constitute a 3-bedroom, family-sized unit in planning terms), which is contrary to Policy DM13 of the Council's LDF Core Strategy April 2012 and which is afforded significant weighting in the overall planning balancing exercise.\r\rIn conclusion and on balance, the delivery of one additional residential dwelling is considered not to demonstrably outweigh the disbenefits associated with standards of internal and external living space and highways and transportation and loss of family sized accommodation, and in this respect many of the previous reasons for refusal have failed to be overcome/addressed in this submission.\r\rIt is therefore recommended that the application be refused.  \r\rRecommendation\rThat planning permission be REFUSED.\r",
