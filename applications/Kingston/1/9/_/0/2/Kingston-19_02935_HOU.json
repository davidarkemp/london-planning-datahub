    "The development hereby permitted shall begin before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.\r\t\rReason:  As required  by Section 91 of  the Town  and Country Planning  Act  1990,  as amended by Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004.\r",
    "Development  shall  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  the  materials  specified  on  the approved plans and on the application form unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority.\r\t\rReason: To ensure a satisfactory appearance on completion of the development in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r",
    "Before the beneficial occupation of the development hereby permitted, any rooflights in the west elevation and situated at the loft level shall be fitted with, and retained in, obscure glazing to a minimum of level 3 on the standard scale. Any film used to achieve the requisite obscurity level shall be non-perishable and tamper-proof, and must be replaced in the event that it ceases to result in obscurity to level 3. \r\rReason: To safeguard the amenities of the adjoining premises from overlooking and loss of privacy.\r",
    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwelling.\r\r6 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations have been received. \r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings. \r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment:  The proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development. \r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rOfficer Comment: Officers consider that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. \r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
    "Application Site\rThe site comprises a detached dwelling and detached single garage.\r\rProposal\rThe application seeks the erection of an extension to the existing garage and the provision of a vehicular crossover.\r\rThe application is essentially a revision of application reference 20/00173/HOU, which was refused because the applicant failed to demonstrate that the proposal would have had an acceptable impact on highway safety.\r\rConsultations\r8 surrounding properties were notified of the proposal. 1 objection was received. This objection referred to another letter but this letter was not received.\r\rSince that time, a second round of consultation was carried out. No representations were received in response to this.\r\rOfficers are however mindful of the representations made in respect of 20/02672/HOU, given the similarities between that scheme and the current application.\r\rRBK Highways and Transport - No objection\r\rAssessment\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The planning history;\r- The design of the proposed development; \r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of and and buildings; and,\r- The impact of the development on highway safety.\r\rPlanning History\rAs noted above, the current application is essentially a revision of 20/00173/HOU, which was refused because the applicant failed to demonstrate that the proposal would have had an acceptable impact on highway safety.\r\rThe current application is identical in terms of scale and design, with the only difference being the submission of additional information relating to the transport impacts of the proposal. The test is whether this additional information is sufficient to overcome the previous reason for refusal and render the application acceptable in its own right.\r\rIn carrying out this assessment, officers are mindful of the recent publication of the London Plan 2021, which supersedes the London Plan 2016 and now forms part of the development plan for the Borough. Officers have not identified any material change in site circumstances since the previous application was refused.\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed design is essentially unchanged from 20/02672/HOU, which was previously found to be acceptable in terms of its impact on the character and appearance of the area. Since that time, there has been a change in planning policy circumstances, namely the publication of the London Plan 2021. However, this change does not lead officers to alter their previous conclusion. The proposed development is therefore considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed design is essentially unchanged from 20/02672/HOU, which was previously found to be acceptable in terms of its impact on the character and appearance of the area. Since that time, there has been a change in planning policy circumstances, namely the publication of the London Plan 2021. It is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rHighway Safety\rPolicy T4 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should reflect and be integrated with current and planned transport access, capacity and connectivity. Where appropriate, mitigation, either through direct provision of public transport, walking and cycling facilities and highways improvements or through financial contributions, will be required to address adverse transport impacts that are identified. Development proposals should not increase road danger.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 also requires developments to ensure that highway safety will not be adversely affected.\r\rOfficer Comment: The existing garage is located adjacent to a residential access road but is nevertheless on a bend and in close proximity to two junctions. Planning permsision for the existing garage, as well as a crossover to serve it, was granted under application reference 01/06577/FUL and was conditional on sight lines being provided. These sight lines were not provided and the crossover was not implemented. \r\rOfficers found that the previous proposal would have been likely to exacerbate these issues by potentially doubling the vehicle movements to and from the garage whilst failing to provide adequate visibility splays or a safe means of crossing the footway. For these reasons, officers considered that the applicant had failed to demonstrate that the proposal would not have an unacceptable impact on highway safety.\r\rThis application is supported by drawings of visibility splays and a transport statement, both of which were absent from the previously refused application. The Council's Highways and Transportation Department has reviewed the application and no longer raises any objection to the proposal.\r\rAlthough no conditions were recommended by the Highways and Transportation Department, officers are mindful of the history of the site and the previous failure to provide a satisfactory crossover or visibility splays. Accordingly, officers recommend conditions to ensure that these are provided prior to use of the garage.\r\rSubject to these conditions, officers are satisfied that the proposal would have an acceptable impact on the safety and operation of the highway network.\r\rConclusion\rThe proposed development would have an acceptable impact on the character and appearance of the area, on the amenities of neighbouring occupiers and, subject to conditions, on the safety and operation of the highway network. Officers therefore consider the proposal to be in accordance with the development plan.\r\rThere are no other material considerations which indicate that permission should be refused. Accordingly, officers recommend that planning permission be granted.",
