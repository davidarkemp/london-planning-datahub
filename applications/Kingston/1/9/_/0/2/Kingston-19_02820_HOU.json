    "The proposed development by virtue of its excessively prominent roof form would result in a poorly designed building, which would erode the established character of the area. As such, the proposed development would be contrary to policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LFD Core Strategy April 2012.",
    "The council is not satisfied that the proposed development would result in the creation of a residential annexe but in effect a separate residential unit. Therefore the  proposed development by virtue of the scale, form, location, layout and design of the dwelling would result in an incongruous form of development that would erode the established character of the area. As such, the proposed development would result in the inappropriate development of garden land reducing the role such land can play in reinforcing suburban character, and would therefore be contrary to policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LFD Core Strategy April 2012.",
    "The proposed development would provide an inadequate level of private amenity space to serve this residential unit. Furthermore the development does not provide a reasonable level of internal floorspace. As such the scheme would result in a sub-standard level of living accommodation contrary to policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LFD Core Strategy April 2012.",
    "Reasonable efforts have been made to check that the plans submitted for the purposes of this planning application are consistent from one to the next, and that the development hereby approved can be implemented in accordance with all of the plans submitted. Should it transpire that this is not possible and that your plans are flawed, please be clear that it may be impossible to implement this permission, and that any development undertaken which relies on this permission may be unauthorised and subject to enforcement action.\r",
    "Your attention is drawn to the fact that planning permission does not override property rights and any ancient rights of light that may exist.  This permission does not empower you to enter onto land not in your ownership without the specific consent of the owner.  If you require further information or advice, you should consult a solicitor.",
    "In accordance with the requirements of Local Government Act 1972 The Plans / Drawings / Documents submitted with the application are available on the Council's website.\r\rhttps://www.kingston.gov.uk/info/200155/planning_applications_and_permissions/263/find_a_planning_application_or_appeal",
