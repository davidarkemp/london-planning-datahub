    "Prior approval is granted as the proposal would be in accordance with the provisions of Class M in Part 3 of Schedule 2 of the Town & Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "The development hereby approved shall not be occupied until such a time as a scheme has been submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority detailing how the development would be car free i.e. ensure that occupiers of the residential units hereby permitted including their visitors, other than those with disabilities who are blue badge holders, will not have an entitlement to obtain parking permits from the Council. The scheme shall also include details of how future occupiers will be informed of the restriction, prior to occupation. The development shall not be occupied otherwise than in accordance with the approved scheme unless prior approval is issued by the Council. \r\rReason: To avoid the congestion of surrounding roads by parked vehicles, and any resultant inconsiderate and dangerous driving as a result,  in accordance with Policies DM9 (Managing Vehicle Use for New Development) and Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy (2012)",
    "Prior to the occupation of the development hereby approved a scheme of noise insulation/reduction shall be submitted to ensure that the noise level of 35 dBLAeq,16 hour in living rooms and bedrooms during the daytime (0700 to 2300 hours) and 30 dBLAeq,8 hour  and 45 dBLAmax during the night time (measured with F time-weighting and between 2300 and 0700 hours) in bedrooms in accordance with BS8233:2014 shall not be exceeded.  Where these levels cannot be met with windows open appropriate acoustic ventilation should be provided so that the room can be sufficiently ventilated.  The acoustic performance of any passive vent, variable speed mechanical air supply unit or whole house ventilation must be sufficient to ensure that the noise level standards given above are not compromised. The development shall be carried out in accordance with the approved details.\r\rReason:  To safeguard the amenities of the future residential occupiers in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.",
    "The development shall be completed and thereafter permananently retained in accordance with the following details which shall have been submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority, prior to occupation.  \r\r(a)  all external changes to the building; and,\t\r(b)  materials for all external finishes (including their manufacturer(s) specification, colour and texture). \r\rReason: To ensure a satisfactory appearance on completion of the development in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.",

The Building Control Service will assume that an applicant has obtained any necessary agreements with the adjoining owner, and nothing said or implied by the Council should be taken as removing the necessity for the building owner to comply fully with the Party Wall Act. Further information and advice is to be found in \"The Party Walls etc. Act 1996 - Explanatory Booklet\".\r",

    "Should the access into the site during construction not be paved, spoil could be carried from the site onto the public highway. The access into the site should be paved to minimise the carryover of spoil onto adjacent roads.We would also require the applicant to sweep and wash down the adjacent roads to ensure that the public highway is kept clear of debris. This is to ensure a satisfactory road surface for road safety reasons at all times.",
