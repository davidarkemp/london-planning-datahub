    "Development  shall  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  the  materials  specified  on  the approved plans and on the application form unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority.\r\rReason: To ensure a satisfactory appearance on completion of the development in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r",
    "The development hereby permitted shall begin before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.\r\rReason: This is required by Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990.",
    "Notwithstanding the provisions of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (or any Order revoking and/or re-enacting that Order) no windows, other than those shown on the approved plans shall at any time be placed in the side elevation of the building/extension hereby permitted without the grant of a separate planning permission from the Local Planning Authority.\r \rReason: To safeguard the amenities of the adjoining premises from overlooking and loss of privacy.",
    "The roof area of the extension hereby permitted shall not be used as a balcony, roof garden or similar amenity area without the grant of further specific planning permission from the Local Planning Authority.\r\rReason: To safeguard the amenities of the adjoining premises.\r",
    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwelling.\r\rFive neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations have been received. \r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings. \r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed single storey rear infill extension would extend no further than the line of the existing rear projection with a height that would be within what is recommended by the Residential Design Guide SPD. The proposed parapet wall would border No.13 Cleaveland, in a depth that would match the extension and be under 3m in height. The rear extension would be rendered to match elements of the existing dwelling, while the parapet wall would be in brick.  \r\rAn additional rooflight is proposed to the front of the roof slope at a lower height to the existing rooflights. It is noted that a similar design is existing at No. 78 Cleaveland Road and therefore impact to the streetscene will be minimal.\r\rTherefore, the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development. \r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rOfficer Comment: The rear extension would be built up to the boundaries of both neighbouring properties. No.13 Cleaveland Road has a rear projection that falls in line with the proposed rear extension, and therefore will have no adverse impact on the amenity of this neighbouring property. No. 11 Cleaveland Road also enjoys an existing rear extension and is separated by an existing parapet wall with the applicants property, therefore there will be no adverse impact on the amenity of the neighbouring property.\r\rTherefore, It is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. \r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
