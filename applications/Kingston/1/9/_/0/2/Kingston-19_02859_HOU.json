    "The proposed outbuilding by reason of its design, bulk and poor detailing; would appear as an overly dominant structure within the application site which would be indicative of a separate independent dwelling. As such, the proposal would appear as a visually incongruous and unsympathetic form of development which would unbalance the modest character of the application site and would be at odds with the streetscene of Malvern Road. The proposal would be contrary to Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames LDF Core Strategy (Adopted April 2012), and the Residential Design SPD (Adopted July 2013).",
    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwelling.\r\rFour neighbouring peoperties have been notified and no representations have been received.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: Officers acknowledge the proposed extension is deep at approximatly 8.25 metres with a flat roof but due to the seperation distance between No. 44 and No. 42 the extension would be compliant with BRE guidance in relation to the 45 degree rule and will not appear as overbear or enclosing. It is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would accord with the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2016) Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
