    "Development  shall  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  the  materials  specified  on  the approved plans and on the application form unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority.\r\rReason: To ensure a satisfactory appearance on completion of the development in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r",
    "The development hereby permitted shall begin before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.\r\rReason: This is required by Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990.",
    "The flat roof area(s) of the development to which this permission relates shall not be used as a roof garden, balcony, seating area or other similar amenity area, and shall not be accessed except for the purpose of maintenance or in the case of emergency.\r\rReason: To ensure satisfactory living conditions for neighbouring occupiers, in accordance with policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "Prior to the beneficial occupation of the development to which this permission relates, details of waste and recycling facilities to serve the development to which this permission relates shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority. \r\rThe refuse and recycling facilities as shown in the approved details shall be provided prior to beneficial occupation of the development and shall be permanently retained thereafter. The developer and/or their successors in title shall take all reasonable steps to ensure that all refuse and recyclable materials associated with the development are either stored within these facilities or internally within the building(s) on the application site, and that no refuse or recycling material is stored or placed for collection on the public highway except on the day of collection.\r\rReason: To ensure proper waste management in the interests of the character and appearance of the area and the living conditions of neighbouring occupiers, in accordance with policies 5.17 and 7.4 of the London Plan 2016 and policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwelling.\r\rSix neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations have been received. \r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings. \r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed single storey rear extension would extend 6m in depth which is considerably over the parameters set by the Residential Design Guide SPD for semi-detached dwellings (3 - 3.5m depth). However, officers note that the existing single storey side extension on site extends farther than the proposed rear extension. Similarly, the proposed rear extension would extend to be in line with the neighbouring properties rear extension. Therefore, considering the nature of the site, the proposed development would appear a proportionate addition to the host property. The proposed flat roof would be in match the roof of the neighbouring properties rear extension and the proposed materials would be in keeping with the host property. \r\rTherefore, the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development. \r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed rear extension would be 6m in depth however, as noted above, the rear extension would be in line with neighbouring property No. 89 Warren Drive South's rear extension and would not extend further in depth, than the applicant's existing side extension. Therefore, the proposed single storey rear extension would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. \r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwelling.\r\rNine neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations have been received. \r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings. \r-Parking\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: While the Residential Design Guide SPD recommends that single storey side extensions are set in from the boundaries and set back from the front fenestration, officers note that similar side extensions are viewed on the streetscene, notably from adjoining properties No. 185 and 189 Kings Road. Given that the proposed side extension would be visually in keeping with the immediate surrounding area, the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development. \r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rOfficer Comment: As mentioned above the proposed single storey side extension would sit against the boundary. However, as adjoining property No.189 Kings Road benefits from an existing side extension of similar dimensions with no existing side windows, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. \r\rPolicy DM9 of the Council's LDF Core Strategy (2012) states that new development must comply with local car parking standards in order that it does not contribute to congestion or compromise highway safety. Policy DM10 supports this stance. \r\rOfficer Comment: London Plan policy T5 requires all development to include provision for cycle parking. Given that the proposed development would sever the existing access to the rear of the property it is unclear from the plans where cycle parking would be accommodated. As such, officers recommend that the provision of cycle parking should be implemented by a condition to include adequate cycle parking.\r\rTherefore, the proposal is considered not to have an adverse impact upon car parking provision, traffic congestion or highway safety, in compliance with Policy DM9 and DM10.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
