    "The development hereby permitted shall be commenced within 3 years from the date of this decision.\r\rReason: In order to comply with Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act, 1990.  (As amended)\r",

The approved scheme shall be implemented within the first planting season following completion of the development and the planting and landscaping shall thereafter be maintained for five years to the satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority.  Any trees or shrubs which die during this period shall be replaced in the first available planting season, and the area shown to be landscaped shall be permanently retained for that purpose only.  \r\rReason: In the interests of visual amenity and also that the Local Planning Authority shall be satisfied as to the details of the development in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r",
    "Within 3 months of first occupation, evidence must be submitted to the Council confirming that the development hereby permitted has achieved no less than the C02 reductions (ENE1), internal water usage (WAT1) standards equivalent to Code for Sustainable Homes Level 4.  Evidence requirements are detailed in the \"Schedule of Evidence Required for Post Construction Stage from ENE1 and WAT1 of the Code for Sustainable Homes Guide.  Evidence to demonstrate a 19% reduction compared to 2013 Part L regulations and internal water usage rates of 105L/day must be submitted to the Local Planning Authority, unless otherwise agreed in writing.\r\rReason:  In order to ensure that all development is designed and built to make the most efficient use of resources, reduce its lifecycle impact on the environment and contributes to climate change mitigation and adaptation in accordance with Policy CS1 (Climate Change Mitigation) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r",
    "Prior to occupation the following details shall have been submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority, implemented prior to occupation and thereafter permanently retained:\r(a)  boundary treatment, including walls, fences and gates (including their manufacturer's specification, dimensions, colour and texture).\r\rReason: In order to ensure a satisfactory appearance on completion of the development in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r",

Should it transpire that this is not possible and that your plans are flawed, please be clear that it may be impossible to implement this permission, and that any development undertaken which relies on this permission may be unauthorised and subject to enforcement action if expedient.",
    "The development approved by this planning permission will be liable to pay the Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) to the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames and the Mayor of London's Community Infrastructure Levy (MCIL).\rPayment will be due once the owner/developer serves a development Commencement Notice on the Council, and a payment Demand Notice has been received by the owner.  Failure to submit a Commencement Notice will incur a surcharge of 20% of the chargeable amount or £2,500, whichever is the lower amount.\r   \rWhen you have discharged all pre-commencement conditions the Council will issue a Liability Notice to the owner setting out the CIL calculations.  Accompanying the Liability Notice will be a  blank Commencement Notice and if necessary a blank Assumption of Liability form, both of which need to be completed and returned to the Council prior to development commencing.  A failure to do so will incur a surcharge.\r  \rShould you have any questions in respect of the contents of this letter or CIL more generally, please contact the Council's Contact Centre by email cil@kingston.gov.uk or phone 0208 547 5002.\r",
