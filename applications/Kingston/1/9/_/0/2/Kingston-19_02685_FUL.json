    "\r44 Neighbouring properties have been notified and four objections have been received stating \r- Excessive height or bulk of buildings\r- Inappropriate design/layout\r- Loss of light/Sunlight\r- Noise\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of and and buildings.\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: Officers consider that the proposed maximum depth of the extension would be of an unacceptably excessive nature and would fail to accord with the prevailing suburban pattern of development in the area. It is considered that there would be an unacceptable adverse impact on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposals.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  With regards to amenity, whilst Officers acknowledge that the extension would not cause any unacceptable adverse impacts on neighbouring properties in relation to overlooking, loss of privacy or sunlight/daylight. The proposed development however, would result in a significant loss of private outdoor amenity space.\r\rAlthough levels of private amenity space may vary considerably in different character areas, Policy Guidance 13 of the Residential Design SPD 2013 states that family dwellings (defined as dwellings with 3+ bedrooms) should have a minimum of 50m2 of private garden, where the prevailing character allows and that additional floor space should not be achieved through the loss of private amenity space below these standards. The proposed extension would reduce the level of private amenity space to approximately 25 sqm which would conflict with this guidance.\r\rTherefore, It is considered that the proposed development would have an unacceptable adverse impact upon the amenities of the future occupants of the development.",
    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwelling.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design.

    "This application is of a nature where the Council's Constitution delegates the authority to make the decision to Officers rather than it being decided by a Committee of Councillors.  \r\rBefore preparing this summary report a Planning Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, considered any relevant previous planning applications, and considered any comments made by those interested in the application such as consultees with specialist knowledge and nearby residents.\r \rBy indicating that the development proposal complies with relevant planning policies, the planning officer is taking into account the information submitted with the application, any previous relevant applications, any comments received in connection with the application and any other case specific considerations which are material to the decision.",

Currently the premises are open until this time Monday through Saturday. Officers are satisfied that the noise, vibration and odour mitigation measures already installed at the site would ensure adequate living conditions for neighbouring residential occupiers and consider that opening until 9pm is not unreasonable given the nature of the business and the location of the site within a designated local centre. It is further noted that there are other hot food takeaways in the area which are open until approximately this time on Sundays. Overall, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of noise and disturbance, fumes or odours to an unacceptable degree.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposal is considered to be in accordance with the development plan and there are no other material considerations which indicate that permission should be refused. Accordingly, it is recommended that planning permission be granted.",
