    "The erection of hip to gable and rear dormer roof extensions with installation of 1 x rooflight to front roofslope falls within the parameters of permitted development as set out under Schedule 2, Part 1, Class  B and C of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwelling.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  It is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rIn addition the losss of the garage accommodation would not result in increased demand for on street parking. Sufficient hard standing would remain at the front of the property to serve at leaset 2 car parking spaces off-street and the proposal would not prejudice highway safety.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would accord with the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2016) Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013)."
