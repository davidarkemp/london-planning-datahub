    "The fee required for your planning application is £ 1750.00.  If payment is by cheque please make payable to Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames or via the Contact Centre on 0208 547 5002. You may also pay online via the RBK website www.kingston.gov.uk",
    "Approve - The proposed amendments taken individually and cululuatively with any other changes are considered to be non-material.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way.  We have made available detailed advice in the form or our statutory policies in the Core Strategy, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably. Amendments required to make the application acceptable are substantial and would materially change the development proposal.  They would require further consultation to be undertaken prior to determination which could not take place within the statutory determination period specified by the Department of Communities and Local Government.\r",
    "Inspection:\rSite inspection carried out as a desktop exercise due to COVID19 lockdown. Photos provided by the applicant as supporting material to application.\r\rAssessment:\rThese are repeat works needed to manage the growth of 2 large trees. Both trees can be seen in the photo to have some deadwood and the Lime has some sparseness in the upper crown. The trees would also benefit from an aerial inspection being undertaken during the works to ensure they are safe.\r\rRecommendation:\rApprove.\r",
    "If the existing kitchen window is to be reused,  it is to be compliant with the required U-value of 1.4 w/m²K otherwise replace/upgrade (L, Vol 1)"
