    "Pedestrian/vehicular intervisibility splays of 2.8m x 3.3m should be provided in each direction where the access meets the back edge of footway, and shall be permanently retained free from any obstruction to visibility higher than 1.0m above ground level.\r\rReason: To maintain pedestrian/vehicular intervisibility in the interest of highway safety in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy  May 2012.",
    "Notwithstanding the information submitted the opening width of the crossover should be no greater than 4 metres\r\rReason: In the interest of highway safety, visual amenity, and to ensure a good environment is provided for all users of the highway (pavement).",
    "The site comprises a linked dwelling.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of and and buildings.\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  It is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would accord with the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2016) Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
    "The development approved by this planning permission will be liable to pay the Kingston's and Mayor of London's Community Infrastructure Levy (MCIL) .  We have calculated the amount of MCIL liability to be £35 per square metre and Kingston's CIL as £210 per square metre. \r\rPayment will be due once the owner/developer serves a development Commencement Notice on the Council, and a payment Demand Notice has been received by the owner.  Failure to submit a Commencement Notice will incur a surcharge of 20% of the chargeable amount or £2,500, whichever is the lower amount.   \r\rWhen you have approved/discharged all pre-commencement conditions the Council will issue a Liability Notice to the owner setting out the MCIL calculation.  Accompanying the Liability Notice will be a  blank Commencement Notice and if necessary a blank Assumption of Liability form, both of which need to be completed and returned to the Council prior to development commencing.  A failure to do so will incur a surcharge.  \r\rShould you have any questions in respect of the contents of this letter or the MCIL more generally, please contact the Council's Contact Centre by email mcil@rbk.kingston.gov.uk <mailto:mcil@rbk.kingston.gov.uk> or phone 0208 547 5002.\r",
    "The site comprises a terraced house.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of the adjoining buildings.\r\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed rear dormer roof extension would not be set back from the ridge of the roof and sides as recommnded in Policy Guidance 39 of the Council's Residential Design SPD. The proposed dormer would add considerable bulk to the host dwelling and would be prominent within the street scene, the dormer would be visible from Rushey Close and Barnsbury Close. As a result, officers consider that the proposal would result in an incongruous and\runduly prominent feature within the existing street scene, which would be unacceptably detrimental to the character and appearance of the area. Therefore, officers consider the proposal to be contrary to Policies 7.4 and 7.6 of the London\rPlan 2016 and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.\r\rThe proposed single storey rear extenson would measure approx. 6m in depth and would heave eaves approx. 2.7m high. \r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  It is considered that the proposed development would have an unacceptable adverse impact upon the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance/loss of light/loss of privacy (delete as appropriate).",

    "Please confirm \r- that the proposed materials would match the existing ones (the sides and face of the dormer should match the existing roof)\r- that the proposed roof lights would not protrude more than 0.15 metres beyond the plane of the slope of the original roof when measured from the perpendicular with the external surface of the original roof\r- that any window located on a roof slope forming a side elevation of the dwellinghouse must be—\r(a) obscure-glazed; and\r(b) non-opening unless the parts of the window which can be opened are more than 1.7 metres above the floor of the room in which the window is installed.\r",
