    "That the applicant is informed that the submitted details, as set out above are agreed and that the condition, as noted above, is fully discharged.\r",
    "The site comprises a detached dwelling.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development;\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; \r- Parking; and,\r- The impact of the development on the significance of heritage assets.\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed side extension would not be set in from the side boundary of the dwelling. However, officers note that this is the case with the existing garage and consider that this in isolation would not warrant refusal of the application. None of the proposed extensions would extend significantly beyond the rear building line of adjoining neighbours and they would satisfy the 45 degree test as set out in the Residential Design SPD. It is recommended that the proposed south-west facing window at first floor level be obscure glazed and fixed shut to prevent any harmful overlooking and subject to this condition, Officers consider that the proposal would not result in any materially harmful loss of privacy. Overall, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.",
