    "The applicant is informed that the submitted details are unacceptable and show an incorrect layout to that approved under 18/12928/FUL.  Therefore Condition 19 cannot be discharged.",
    "The assessment has been based on the original layout of the dwelling. The original layout of the dwelling has a rear projection (bay window) and as a result the proposed extension would extend beyond an original side wall and would have a width greater than half the width of the original dwellinghouse. The development therefore conflicts with paragraph A.1 (j) (iii).\r\rThe proposal would require planning permission.\r",
