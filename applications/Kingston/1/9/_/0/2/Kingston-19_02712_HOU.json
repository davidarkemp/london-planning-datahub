    "The development hereby permitted shall begin before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.\r\t\rReason:  As required  by Section 91 of  the Town  and Country Planning  Act  1990,  as amended by Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004.\r",
    "Development  shall  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  the  materials  specified  on  the approved plans and on the application form unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority.\r\t\rReason: To ensure a satisfactory appearance on completion of the development in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r",
    "The proposed roof of the single storey rear extension hereby permitted shall not be converted or used as a balcony or a sitting out area, and no access shall be gained except for maintenance purposes. \r\t\rReason: To protect the amenities and privacy of the adjoining properties in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r",
    "This application is of a nature where the Council's Constitution delegates the authority to make the decision to Officers rather than it being decided by a Committee of Councillors.  \r\rBefore preparing this summary report a Planning Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, considered any relevant previous planning applications, and considered any comments made by those interested in the application such as consultees with specialist knowledge and nearby residents.\r \rBy indicating that the development proposal complies with relevant planning policies, the planning officer is taking into account the information submitted with the application, any previous relevant applications, any comments received in connection with the application and any other case specific considerations which are material to the decision.",
    "Policies 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan 2016 require that development have regard to the form, function and structure of an area, place or street, as well as the scale, mass and orientation of surrounding buildings. Architecture should make a positive contribution to a coherent public realm, streetscape and wider cityscape.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed rear dormer would increase in width but would remain appropriately set in from the sides of the roof slope, as well as up from the eaves and down from the ridge. The proposed development is therefore considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rPolicy 7.6 of the London Plan 2016 requires that buildings and structures do not cause unacceptable harm to the amenity of surrounding land and buildings, particularly residential buildings, in relation to privacy, overshadowing, wind and microclimate.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design SPD 2013 requires proposals to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  While the width of the rear dormer would increase, the extent of glazing would remain the same as the original permission. It is therefore considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rIn conclusion, it is considered that the proposal is in accordance with the development plan and there are no other material considerations which indicate that permission should be refused. Accordingly, it is recommended that planning permission be granted.",
    "Please be advised that the application would need to be in the same name as the previous application in order to qualify for the 'free-go' resubmission",
    "Please be advised that the Proposed Plans, showing the revisions to be made have not been submitted with this application. Kindly arrange for these to be sent, along with the previously approved (proposed plans) from the planning consent granted.",
    "You are required to complete the 'Determining whether a Development may be CIL Liable Planning Application Additional Information Requirement form'. This form can be downloaded from the planning portal at https://ecab.planningportal.co.uk/uploads/1app/forms/form_1_cil_additional_information.pdf. Please complete and return as soon as possible.\r\r\rWhilst writing if you have confirmed that the development is Cil Liable, please also complete the Assumption of Liability Form at https://www.planningportal.co.uk/info/200136/policy_and_legislation/70/community_infrastructure_levy/5 and return as soon as possible."
