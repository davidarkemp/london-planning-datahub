    "The development hereby permitted shall begin before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.\r\t\rReason:  As required  by Section 91 of  the Town  and Country Planning  Act  1990,  as amended by Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004.\r",
    "The development hereby approved shall be carried out in accordance with the materials specified on the approved plans and on the application form unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority.\r\rReason: To ensure a satisfactory appearance on completion of the development in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r",
    "The roof of the extension hereby permitted shall not be converted or used as a balcony or a sitting out area, and no access shall be gained except for maintenance purposes.\r\rReason: To protect the amenities and privacy of the adjoining residential properties in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.",
    "The site comprises a detached dwelling and is located on a private road.\r\rSix neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations have been received.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment:  The site does not lie within a conservation area and the buildings on the site are not listed or locally listed. In addition Officers note the various roof forms and heights along Dell Walk and acknowledge that both properties adjacent to the application property are higher, although, not by a considerable amount. \r\rWith regards to the proposed rear dormer roof extension, Officers note that it would not achieve strict compliance with Policy Guidance 39 of the Residential design SPD 2013, particularly in terms of set down from the roof ridge, however, it would not be visible from the street, or be unduly overbearing.\r\rGiven the site context, which is typifed by detached family properties and the variety of roof forms previously mentioned, it is considered that the alterations to the roof height and form would not have an unacceptable adverse impact on the street scene. \r\rOverall, the proposed development would be in keeping with the host dwelling, is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design and there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: Due to the siting of the propsed development and the separation distances between the neighbouring properties, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy to an unacceptable degree.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would accord with the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2016) Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
