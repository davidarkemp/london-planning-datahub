    "The development hereby permitted shall begin before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.\r\t\rReason:  As required  by Section 91 of  the Town  and Country Planning  Act  1990,  as amended by Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004.\r",
    "Development  shall  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  the  materials  specified  on  the approved plans and on the application form unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority.\r\t\rReason: To ensure a satisfactory appearance on completion of the development in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r",
    "Before the beneficial occupation of the development hereby permitted, any windows or rooflights in the rear (west) elevation and situated on the loft floor level shall be constructed so that no part of the framework less than 1.7m above finished floor level shall be openable.  Any part below that level shall be fitted with, and retained in, obscure glazing to a minimum of level 3 on the standard scale. Any film used to achieve the requisite obscurity level shall be non-perishable and tamper-proof, and must be replaced in the event that it ceases to result in obscurity to level 3. \r\rReason: To safeguard the amenities of the adjoining premises from overlooking and loss of privacy.\r\t\r",
    "Reasonable efforts have been made to check that the plans submitted for the purposes of this planning application are consistent from one to the next, and that the development hereby approved can be implemented in accordance with all of the plans submitted. Should it transpire that this is not possible and that your plans are flawed, please be clear that it may be impossible to implement this permission, and that any development undertaken which relies on this permission may be unauthorised and subject to enforcement action.\r",
    "Section 59 of the Highways Act permits the Highway Authority to charge developers for damage caused by excessive weight and movements of vehicles to and from a site. The Highway Authority will pass on the cost of any excess repairs compared to normal maintenance costs to the applicant/organisation responsible for the damage. \r",
    "The developer is reminded that it is an offence to allow materials to be carried from the site and deposited on or damage the highway from uncleaned wheels or badly loaded vehicles. The Highway Authority will seek, wherever possible, to recover any expenses incurred in clearing, cleaning or repairing highway surfaces and prosecute persistent offenders. (Highways Act 1980 Sections 131, 148, 149).",
    "This application has been subsequently found to be invalid, as we require floor plans that show the total new floorspace. This will also enable us to determine the correct fee.\r\rPlease provide existing and proposed floor plans at a recognised scale of 1:50 or 1:100, providing a scale bar, showing the outline of entire floor plan, not just part and all key dimensions for the proposed works.\r\r",
    "Page 4 of your Proposed Plans, on the Elevations, is not clear. It labels the application site what may appear to be Number 19 - we would ask that you remove any reference to the adjoining property as this would lead to confusion on consultation to residents, that this application may extend to more than just one property",
    "Please can you pay the Pre-Application fee of Â£1775. This can either be paid online at www.kingston.gov.uk or by calling our Customer Service team on 020 8547 5002",
    "Inspection:\rSite inspection carried out as a desktop exercise with information provided by the applicant as supporting material to application.\r\rAssessment:\rSmall tree to rear of property and it's removal therefore has no impact upon public amenity that might warrant the service of a TPO. This means the Council decision should be one of no objection.\r\rRecommendation:\rNo objection.",
    "Inspection:\rSite inspection carried out as a desktop exercise with information provided by the applicant as supporting material to application.\r\rAssessment:\rMinor necessary works with no adverse impact to public amenity.\r\rRecommendation:\rNo objection.",
    "Inspection:\rSite inspection carried out as a desktop exercise with information provided by the applicant as supporting material to application.\r\rAssessment:\rAppropriate repeat works with no adverse impact upon tree health or public amenity.\r\rRecommendation:\rNo objections."
