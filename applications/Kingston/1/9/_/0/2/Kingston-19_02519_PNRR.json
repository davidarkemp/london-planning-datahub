    "The proposal would fail to satisfy Condition M2-(1)(a) of schedule 2, Part 3, Class M of the 2015 General Permitted Development Order (as amended) as it would have an unacceptable adverse immpact upon transport and highways.  The proposed development is considered to prejudice highway safety and is likely to lead to sporadic, inconsiderate and illegal parking on roads in the vicinity of the site, thereby also failing to comply with Policies DM9 and DM10 of the Council's LDF Core Strategy, 2012.",
    "The proposal would fail to satisfy Condition M2-(1)(e) of schedule 2, Part 3, Class M of the 2015 General Permitted Development Order (as amended) as the proposed design and external appearance of the building would be unacceptable.\r\rThe proposed windows and openings on Acre Road would be visually incongruous and out of character with the application site and the surrounding area, thereby conflicting with Policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy, 2012.\r\r",
    "The proposal would fail to satisfy Condition M2-(1)(d)(i) and (ii) as it would be undesirable for the building to change to a use falling within Class C3 (dwellinghouses) because of the impact of the change of use on the adequate provision of services of the sort that may be provided by a building falling within Class A1 and on the sustainability of that shopping area.  \r\rThe proposal would also conflict with Policy CS12 of the LDF Core Strategy, 2012 as it would fail to maintain the attractive and distinctive character of Kingston Town Centre, through the implementation of the Kingston Town Centre Area Action Plan (K+20)  and conflict with Policy K2 of the Kingston Town Centre Area Action Plan, 2008 (K+20) which seeks to control the use of premises in shopping streets to safeguard and enhance the vitality and viability of Kingston Town Centre.  The site forms part of a designated \"other frontage\".",
