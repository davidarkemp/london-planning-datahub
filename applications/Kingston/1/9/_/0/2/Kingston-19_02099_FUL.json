    "The proposed development, by virtue of the total loss of a mature Beech hedge would result in a harmful impact on the appearance and quality of the surrounding landscape.\tWhat is more, insufficient evidence was provided to demonstrate that the removal of the hedge would not have a detrimental impact on the biodiversity of the area and ecological interests of the site. Therefore, the proposed development would fail to comply with the policies CS8, DM 6 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012.",
