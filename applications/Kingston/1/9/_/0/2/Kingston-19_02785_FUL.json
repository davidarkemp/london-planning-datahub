    "Officer Report\r\rIntroduction\rThis application is of a nature where the Council's Constitution delegates the authority to make the decision to Officers rather than it being decided by a Committee of Councillors.  \r\rBefore preparing this summary report a Planning Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the relevant Development Plan policies and guidance, considered any relevant previous planning applications, and considered any comments made by those interested in the application such as consultees with specialist knowledge and nearby residents.\r \rBy indicating that the development proposal complies with relevant Development Plan policies, the planning officer is taking into account the information submitted with the application, any previous relevant applications, any comments received in connection with the application and any other case specific considerations which are material to the decision.\r\rThis decision has been authorised by a Senior Officer (Authorising Officer) in the Development Management Service. Prior to endorsing the Planning Officer's recommendation, the Authorising Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the application documents, the relevant planning policies and guidance, any relevant history, and any representations received.\r\rSection 38(6) of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004 states that planning applications must be determined in accordance with the development plan unless material considerations indicate otherwise.\r\rThe development plan for the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames comprises the following documents:\r\r- The London Plan 2021\r- The South London Waste Plan 2012 \r- The LDF Core Strategy 2012\r- The Kingston Town Centre Area Action Plan 2008\r\rApplication Site\rThe site comprises a 3-storey semi-detached property which was formerly a single dwelling but has been converted into 5no. flats.\r\rProposal\rThe application seeks the erection of a single storey rear extension and conversion of the property from 5no. flats to 4no. flats. \r\rConsultations\r13 properties were notified of the proposal. No representations were received.\r\rAssessment\rThe key issues in the assessment of this application are:\r- The principle of the development;\r- The standard of the proposed accommodation;\r- The impact of the development on the character and appearance of the area;\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of neighbouring occupiers; and,\r- The impact of the development on the transport network.\r\rPrinciple of Development\rThe NPPF 2019 sets out measures to support the Government's objective of significantly boosting the supply of homes. These include a requirement for planning authorities to identify and update annually a supply of specific deliverable sites sufficient to provide a minimum of five years' worth of housing against their housing requirement set out in adopted strategic policies, or against their local housing need where the strategic policies are more than five years old. The Council cannot currently demonstrate a 5 year housing land supply.\r\rWhere there is an existing shortage of land for meeting identified housing needs, the NPPF also states that it is especially important that planning decisions avoid homes being built at low densities, and ensure that developments make optimal use of the potential of each site.\r\rPolicy H1 of the London Plan 2021 sets a target for the Borough of 9,640 net housing completions within the next ten years. Planning decisions should optimise the potential for housing delivery on all suitable and available brownfield sites to ensure that this target is met.\r\rPolicy H8 of the London Plan 2021 states that loss of existing housing should be replaced by new housing at existing or higher densities with at least the equivalent level of overall floorspace.\r\rAt the local level, Policy CS10 of the Core Strategy 2012 states that the Council will seek to ensure that a broad mix of accommodation options are available to residents and that a range of local housing needs are met and Policy DM14 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 states that the Council will resist the loss of existing accommodation (of all types).\r\rThe application seeks a reduction in the number of flats on the site from five to four. Officers note that a certificate of lawful development was issued for the continued use of the building as five flats in 1998 under application reference 98/3137/LDE.\r\rHowever, officers also note that the site falls within the boundary of a much larger and ongoing residential development, reference 18/12928/FUL. The existing plans submitted with this application, which are much more detailed than those submitted under the current application, show the building as containing six flats. The lawful use of the site is therefore open to question but officers do not have sufficient evidence to answer it conclusively. As such, the application will be assessed on the basis of the applicant's version of events.\r\rIn any event, the proposal would result in the loss of one unit of accommodation on the site, which would not be replaced at existing or higher densities. Therefore, the proposal is contrary to policy H8 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM14 of the Core Strategy 2012. This carries weight against the proposal.\r\rStandard of Accommodation\rPolicy D6 of the London Plan 2021 sets out the standards for new housing within London, in terms of overall gross internal area (\"GIA\"), built-in storage space, bedroom sizes and ceiling heights. Housing development should be of high quality design and provide adequately-sized rooms, with comfortable and functional layouts which are fit for purpose and meet the needs of Londoners without differentiating between tenures. Policy DM13 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 states that the Council will expect proposals for new residential development to demonstrate that the scheme has been designed to provide adequate internal space appropriate to the intended number of occupants.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 requires developments to provide adequate private and/or communal amenity space. Policy Guidance 13 of the Council's Residential Design SPD states that although levels of private amenity space may vary considerably in different character areas, each new flat should have 10m2 (plus an extra 1m2 for each occupant after the first).\r\rThe proposed two bedroom flat on the ground floor would not meet the minimum GIA required by policy D6. It would measure approximately 59sqm, while Policy D6 requires a minimum of 61sqm. It would also fail to provide an built-in storage space, where 2sqm should be provided.\r\rThe proposed one bedroom flat on the ground floor would meet the GIA requirement of 37sqm. 1sqm of built-in storage space should be provided yet none is proposed. The same is true of the proposed one bedroom flat on the first floor, although here 1.5sqm should be provided.\r\rIt is noted that the proposed flat on the second floor would occupy the roof space of the building. It is therefore likely that the floor-to-ceiling height will be limited to some degree and this is evidenced by the fact that areas of this flat have been marked on the submitted drawings as \"storage in eaves\". Policy D6 requires that dwellings have a floor-to-ceiling height of 2.5m or more across at least 75% of their gross internal area. Additionally, areas are discounted from the GIA calculation or counted at a different rate if they are below a certain floor-to-ceiling height. Since no sectional drawings have been provided with the application, officers are unable to assess the standard of this unit.\r\rIn terms of outdoor amenity space, the proposed two bedroom flat on the ground floor would be provided with a private garden, measuring approximately 45sqm. The one bedroom flat on the ground floor would be provided with a \"private patio\" but it is noted that this would not achieve the minimum width of 1.5m as specified by London Plan policy D6. The remaining flats would not benefit from any private outdoor space and no communal space would be provided to compensate for this.\r\rHaving regard to the above, officers consider that the proposed development would offer a poor standard of accommodation both internally and externally. The proposal is therefore contrary to policy D6 of the London Plan 2021 and policies DM10 and DM13 of the Core Strategy 2012. This carries weight against the proposal.\r\rCharacter and Appearance\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rThe proposed rear extension was considered recently under application reference 20/02666/FUL and was found to be acceptable. It is highly material that this permission is extant and could still be implemented on site.\r\rOfficers note that planning policy circumstances have changed since the granting of 20/02666/FUL, insofar as the London Plan 2021, which supersedes the London Plan 2016, has now been published. However, this does not lead officers to reach a different conclusion in respect of the impact of the proposed extension on the character and appearance of the area.\r\rThe current application also proposes that a door be inserted in the flank elevation. Officers consider that this would have a negligible impact on the character and appearance of the area.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rThe only material impacts on the amenities of neighbouring occupiers would result from the proposed single storey rear extension. As with the impact on the character and appearance of the area, officers see no reason to depart from the view previously taken under 20/02666/FUL.\r\rHaving regard to this, officers consider that the impact of the proposed development on the amenities of neighbouring occupiers would be acceptable.\r\rTransport\rPolicy T4 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should reflect and be integrated with current and planned transport access, capacity and connectivity. Where appropriate, mitigation, either through direct provision of public transport, walking and cycling facilities and highways improvements or through financial contributions, will be required to address adverse transport impacts that are identified. Development proposals should not increase road danger.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 requires development proposals to have regard to local traffic conditions and highway safety and ensure they are not adversely affected.\r\rGiven that the proposed development would not involve any new or amended access to the public highway, that the level of on-site parking would remain unaltered and there would be no material change in the character or volume of traffic entering or leaving the site, officers are satisfied that it would have an acceptable impact on highway safety.\r\rPolicy T5 of the London Plan 2021 states that developments should provide cycle parking at least in accordance with the minimum standards set out in Table 10.2 and Figure 10.3, ensuring that a minimum of two short-stay and two long-stay cycle parking spaces are provided.\r\rPolicy DM8 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the Sustainable Transport SPD 2013 together require new development to provide facilities on-site for cyclists as appropriate, including showers, lockers and secure, convenient cycle parking, in accordance with the minimum standards set out in the London Plan.\r\rThe application proposes that six cycle parking spaces be provided within the site frontage. This level of provision is in accordance with London Plan policy T5. It is recommended that full details be secured by condition in the event of permission being granted.\r\rPolicy T6 of the London Plan 2021 states that car parking should be restricted in line with levels of existing and future public transport accessibility and connectivity. The maximum standards as set out in policies T6.1 to T6.5 should be applied to development proposals. Where provided, each motorcycle parking space should count towards the maximum for car parking spaces at all use classes.\r\rPolicy DM9, Policy DM10 and the Council's Sustainable Transport SPD 2013 together require development proposals to comply with the car parking standards in the London Plan.\r\rThe application proposes retention of the two existing on-site car parking spaces. This level of provision is in accordance with London Plan policy T6.1 and is considered to be acceptable. Measures to preclude future occupants of the development from obtaining Council-issued car parking permits are considered to be unnecessary in this instance, since the reduction in the number of units on the site would not be likely to increase competition for on-street car parking spaces.\r\rConclusion\rThe proposed development would result in the loss of one unit of accommodation on the site. The proposal is therefore contrary to policy H8 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM14 of the Core Strategy 2012. Land for the supply of housing within the Borough is constrained, as is housing delivery. Officers therefore attach significant weight to this harm.\r\rThe proposed development would provide substandard accommodation, both internally and externally. The proposal is therefore contrary to policy D6 of the London Plan 2021 and policies DM10 and DM13 of the Core Strategy 2012. \r\rOfficers are mindful of the fact that the proposed accommodation would be an improvement upon the current standard of accommodation, which is a benefit to the proposal. However, the proposed accommodation would nonetheless be substandard and would offer poor living conditions for future occupants. The proposal should therefore be seen as an attempt to replace one form of substandard accommodation with another. Accordingly, officers attach limited weight to this benefit.\r\rThe impact of the proposed development on the character and appearance of the area, on the amenities of neighbouring occupiers, and on the transport network are considered to be acceptable. These are neutral matters.\r\rThe fact that the site forms part of an extant permission for a larger residential development is noted. However, the elements of that permission relating to the site have not been implemented and the site has now been sold on. Thus a new chapter in the history of the site has begun.\r\rHaving regard to the above, officers consider that the harms arising from the loss of accommodation would outweigh the benefits arising from improving the standard of accommodation on the site. The proposal is therefore considered to be contrary to the development plan taken as a whole. In the absence of any other material considerations which would warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan, officers conclude that planning permission should be refused.\r\rBackground Papers\rIn accordance with the requirements of Local Government Act 1972 The Plans / Drawings / Documents submitted with the application are available on the Council's website.\r\rhttps://www.kingston.gov.uk/info/200155/planning_applications_and_permissions/263/find_a_planning_application_or_appeal",

    "The site comprises a detached dwelling.\r\rTen neighbouring properties have been notified and no representations have been received.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: Policy Guidance 44 of the Residential Design SPD states that when designing walls and enclosures they should respect the form and detail of other enclosures in the street so that new walls or enclosures do not appear out of character. The proposed fence would be excessive in height when compared to the prevailing height of boundary treatment in the area. Officers note that fencing along this part of  Upper Brighton Road is a maximum of approximately 2 metres in height.  The proposed fence would therefore appear incongruous and would result in significant harm to the character and appearance of the area.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  Given the nature of the site and proposed development, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rIn conclusion, Officers acknowledge the benefits of the proposed larger fence in relation to security and reduction in noise pollution for the applicant, however, it is not considered that this benefit would outweigh the significant harm to the character and appearance of the area. The proposed development would be excessive in height and out of keeping with the other properties on both Walpole Road and Upper Brighton Road, resulting in an incongruous feature within the streetscene. The proposed development would therefore, not be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan, Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).\r\r",

    "The site comprises a detached dwelling.\r\r9 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and 1 objection has been received relating to the address of the application site and loss of light. \r\rFor the avoidance of doubt the concerns relating to the address have been clarified and the correct address is shown on the submitted drawings. The concerns raised relating to loss of light will be taken into consideration during the assessment of the application and detailed below.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings. \r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed two storey side and rear extension would result in a similar footprint to the existing dwelling. Whilst it is acknowledged that the first floor extension would result in additional mass to the rear of the property, it would have a modest width and as such would appear a proportionate addition to the host dwelling. While the proposed development would not extend past the existing side elevation, it would be partially visible from the streetscene, however, given that it would be of an appropriate scale and form, it would not negatively affect the character of the surrounding area. \r\rTherefore, the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development. \r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rOfficer Comment: Whilst the proposed two storey rear and side extension would project beyond the first floor rear elevation of neighbouring property No.2 Chumleigh Walk, it would not result in a reduction in the separation distance to the shared boundary, or include any side facing windows. At ground floor level the proposed extension would be set back from the rear elevation of No.2 Chumleigh Walk. Therefore, the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of No. 2 Chumleigh Walk by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. \r\rIt is acknowledged that side facing windows are proposed at ground and first floor level facing properties Nos. 34, 32 and 30a Everseley Road, however, due to the considerable separation distance between the proposed development and adjoining properties there would be no loss of light, feeling of overbearing or loss of privacy as a result of the proposed development to Nos. 34, 32 and 30a Everseley Road.\r\rTherefore, It is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. \r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
