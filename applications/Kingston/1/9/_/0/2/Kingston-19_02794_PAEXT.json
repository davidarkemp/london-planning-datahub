    "The development complies with the criteria set out in Schedule 2, Part, 1 Class A of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015.\r\rComments have been raised by a Neighbour - however, they do not raise any planning material consideration. \r\rIn any event Officers have assessed the proposed development and have concluded that the proposed extension would not harm the residential amenities of the occupants of neighbouring land and buildings. \r\r\r",
    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwelling.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of and and buildings.\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: Whilst it is acknowledged that the proposal would exceed the recommended depths for single storey rear extensions as set out in the Council's Residential Design SPD, officers consider that the proposal would not have an unacceptable adverse impact on the character or appearance of the area in terms of scale, form, bulk, height and design. \r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed extension, by reason of its depth, height, and proximity to the boundaries of the site, would create an undue sense of enclosure to No. 347 Ewell Road and unacceptably limit the outlook from the principal window of the nearest ground floor habitable room at this property, thereby resulting in unacceptable living conditions for its occupants. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy 7.6 of the London Plan 2016 and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
