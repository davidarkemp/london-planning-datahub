    "Please provide existing and proposed floor plans/ elevations at a recognised scale of 1:50 or 1:100, providing a scale bar, showing the outline of entire floor plan, not just part and all key dimensions for the proposed works.\r\rIf no changes are proposed to elevations please provide photographs with confirmation that no changes are being made.",
    "Inspection:\rSite inspection carried out as a desktop exercise with information provided by the applicant as supporting material to application.\r\rAssessment:\rMinor works not causing loss of public amenity. The Council response should therefore be one of no objection.\r\rRecommendation:\rNo objections."
