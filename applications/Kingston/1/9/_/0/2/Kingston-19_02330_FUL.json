    "The proposed side dormer extension by virtue of its size, siting and design would create an incongruous addition to the host property that would unbalance the pair of semi-detached properties it forms part of and would be visually intrusive in the streetscene to the detriment of the character and appearance of the pair of semi-detached properties and streetscene. The proposal would not accord with policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012.",
