    "The proposed two storey side extension by reason of its excessive width and the lack of a 0.5m front elevation setback would appear as a disproportionate and incongruous form of development which would unbalance the character of the application property and the pair of semi-detached properties, therefore the proposal would be at odds with the streetscene of Bazalgette Gardens. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames LDF Core Strategy (Adopted April 2012), and the Residential Design SPD (Adopted July 2013).",
    "The proposed two storey side extension by virtue of the first floor rear window serving bedroom (4) would prejudice the neighbouring amenities of no.14 Bazalgette Gardens by way of overlooking and loss of privacy. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames LDF Core Strategy (Adopted April 2012) and the Residential Design SPD (Adopted July 2013).",
    "Please provide scaled plans showing both existing and proposed floor plans, and if any external changes are proposed, elevational plans also, to scale 1:50 or 1:100\r",
    "When submitting your site location plan (to scale 1:1250) please ensure the red line around the application site is acurate and reflects the boundary details.",
    "Your attention is drawn to the fact that planning permission does not override property rights and any ancient rights of light that may exist.  This permission does not empower you to enter onto land not in your ownership without the specific consent of the owner.  If you require further information or advice, you should consult a solicitor.",
    "The Party Wall Act 1996 requires a building owner to notify, and obtain formal agreement from any adjoining owner, where the building owner proposes to carry out work to an existing party wall, build on the boundary with a neighbouring property or, in some circumstances, carry out groundworks within 6 metres of an adjoining building.\r\rNotification and agreements under this Act are the responsibility of the building owner and are quite separate from Building Regulations, or Planning Controls.  The Building Control Service will assume that an applicant has obtained any necessary agreements with the adjoining owner, and nothing said or implied by the Council should be taken as removing the necessity for the building owner to comply fully with the Party Wall Act. Further information and advice is to be found in \"The Party Walls etc. Act 1996 - Explanatory Booklet\".",
    "Inspection:\rSite inspection carried out as a desktop exercise with photos provided by the applicant as supporting material to application.\r\rAssessment:\rThe two trees in question are small Leyland Cypress to the rear of the property and not contributing to public amenity. They are therefore not worthy of a TPO and the only other recourse is to issue a decision stating that this Council has no objections to the notified works.\r\rRecommendation:\rNo objection."
