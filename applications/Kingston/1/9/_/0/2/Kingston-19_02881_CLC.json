    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwelling. The building is not listed but does fall within the St Andrews Square Conservation Area.\r\rFive neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations have been received.\r\rSurbiton neighbourhood Conservation Area Advisory Committee - No response\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development;\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\r- The impact of the development on the St Andrews Square Conservation Area.\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the main dwelling or the surrounding area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  It is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rSection 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended) places a duty on local planning authorities to pay special attention to the desirability of preserving or enhancing the character and appearance of conservation areas, when considering development proposals that would affect land or buildings within them.                                                                                                                  \rIn determining planning applications which affect heritage assets, Paragraph 192 of the NPPF 2019 requires local planning authorities to take account of: the desirability of sustaining and enhancing the significance of heritage assets and putting them to viable uses consistent with their conservation; the positive contribution that conservation of heritage assets can make to sustainable communities including their economic vitality; and the desirability of new development making a positive contribution to local character and distinctiveness.       \r                                                                                                              \rParagraph 193 of NPPF 2019 states that when considering the impact of a proposed development on the significance of a designated heritage asset, great weight should be given to the assets conservation, irrespective of whether any potential harm amounts of substantial harm, total loss or less than substantial harm to its significance.    \r                                          \rPolicies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Core Strategy 2012 sets out the Council's commitment to preserve or enhance the existing heritage assets of the Borough through the promotion of high quality design and a focus on heritage-led regeneration. The Council will allow alterations which preserve or enhance the established character and architectural interest of a heritage asset, its fabric or its setting, and will ensure that development proposals affecting historic assets will use high quality materials and design features which incorporate or compliment those of the host building or the immediate area. Features of local importance and special interest will be respected through the consideration of form, scale, layout and detailed designs of a site, area or streetscape.\r\rOfficer comment: The significance of the St Andrews Square Conservation Area is derived from the area of Victorian housing dating from the 1860s - 1880s, in Gothic and Classical styles, including a garden square unique to South West London. It forms a later phase of the Surbiton \"New Town\" begun in 1838 by Thomas Pooley.\r\rThe nearest listed building to the site is St Andrews Church which is 100 metres to the north on the same side of Maple Road, however, the proposed rear extension would not be visible from it due to the surrounding development and associated boundary treatment and its proportionate and subordinate nature. As such, it is considered that the proposed development would not result in any harm to the significance of this heritage asset. In relation to the Conservation Area, the proposed development is considered not to result in any harm to its significance and would preserve its character and appearance. This is due to not only its proportionate and subordinate nature, but its sensitive design and appropriate materials which would relate well to the main dwelling and the surrounding area. As no harm to the aforementioned heritage assets has been identified it is not necessary to weigh up the proposals against any public benefits. \r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would accord with the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2016) Policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
