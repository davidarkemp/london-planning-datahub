    "Officer Report\r\rIntroduction\rThis application is of a nature where the Council's Constitution delegates the authority to make the decision to Officers rather than it being decided by a Committee of Councillors.  \r\rBefore preparing this summary report a Planning Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the relevant Development Plan policies and guidance, considered any relevant previous planning applications, and considered any comments made by those interested in the application such as consultees with specialist knowledge and nearby residents.\r \rBy indicating that the development proposal complies with relevant Development Plan policies, the planning officer is taking into account the information submitted with the application, any previous relevant applications, any comments received in connection with the application and any other case specific considerations which are material to the decision.\r\rThis decision has been authorised by a Senior Officer (Authorising Officer) in the Development Management Service. Prior to endorsing the Planning Officer's recommendation, the Authorising Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the application documents, the relevant planning policies and guidance, any relevant history, and any representations received.\r\rSection 38(6) of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004 states that planning applications must be determined in accordance with the development plan unless material considerations indicate otherwise.\r\rThe development plan for the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames comprises the following documents:\r\r- The London Plan 2021\r- The South London Waste Plan 2012 \r- The LDF Core Strategy 2012\r- The Kingston Town Centre Area Action Plan 2008\r\rApplication Site\r\rThe application site is occupied by a two storey semi detached building.\r\rProposal\r\rThe application seeks permission for the erection of single storey rear and first floor side extensions.\r\rConsultation\r\r5 properties were notified of the proposal. No representations were received.\r\rAssessment\rThe main issues in the assessment of the application are:\r- The impact of the development on the character and appearance of the area; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of neighbouring occupiers;\r- The impact of the development on flooding\r\rCharacter and Appearance\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rThe proposed single storey extension would project 3.2m (depth) x 4m (width) from the rear wall of the existing building, with a flat roof design (Xm in height). The extension would integrate and align with the existing rear extension and incorporate 2 lantern roof lights and bifold doors across the rear elevation.\r\rThe first floor extension would be set back 800mm from the front elevation of the host building, would be 1.4m wide and 7m in depth to align with the existing rear wall, and setback from the ground floor below as it relates to No.96 Somerset, ensuring both a physical and visual separation of the built form. The external materials proposed are to match with the existing building. \r\rThe proposed roof form would relate well to the host property and would not exceed the ridge of the existing main roof, in accordance with Policy Guidance 36. It is considered that the proposed extensions would appear as a proportionate and subordinate addition in relation to the host dwelling. \r\rOfficers also note that the neighbouring property at No.96 Somerset Avenue has obtained planning permission 20/03162/HOU for a similar development at both ground and first floor levels.\r\rHaving regard to the above, the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design and there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rNos.96 and 100 Somerset Avenue are the principal properties to be considered in relation to amenity.  Due to the setback of the proposed first floor side extension there would be no unacceptable loss of light or outlook to neighbouring habitable rooms of No.96 Somerset Avenue. Existing windows to the side elevation of No.96 Somerset serve stairwell areas, and are proposed to be removed by planning permission 20/01362/HOU. Notwithstanding this, the proposed window to the side elevation at first floor level would serve a stairwell, and will be obscured by condition.\r\rWith regards to No. 100 Somerset Avenue there would be no adverse impact due to the nature and siting of the proposals. \r\rTherefore, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rHaving regard to the above, officers consider that the impact of the proposed development on the amenities of neighbouring occupiers would be acceptable.\r\rFlood Risk\r\rThe application site falls within Flood Risk Zone 2. Consequently the Flood Risk Assessment: Standing Advice issued by the Environment Agency and DEFRA, 2012 must be applied. For minor extensions such as this it is essential that the proposed floor level is no lower than existing in order to mitigate future flood risk impacts. \r\rOfficer Comment: The Flood Risk Form submitted by the applicant indicates that the proposed extension would be set no lower than the main dwelling and appropriate mitigation measures would be implemented as part of the proposed development which are considered acceptable and in accordance with Policy DM4 of the LDF Core Strategy (2012).\r \rConclusion\r\rThe proposed development would accord with the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2016) Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).\r\rHaving regard to the above, officers consider the proposal to be in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole.

    "The site comprises a commercial unit located on the ground floor of a terraced property forming a parade of shops, with residential properties on the floors above. \r\r20 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and 4 objections have been received relating to:\r\r- Access or traffic problems;\r- Car park issues;\r- Fumes;\r- Noise; and,\r- Unacceptable or incompatible use.\r\rThe concerns raised will be taken into consideration during the assessment of the application and detailed below.\r\rRBK Environmental Health Officer - The proposal should be refused unless an acoustic report is submitted demonstrating that the noise front he kitchen extract system would be within the recommended guidelines. Full details with calculations of the proposed extraction system should be submitted to demonstrate that odour and noise would be in compliance with relevant guidelines. The applicant should be aware that within the drawing submitted the fan is located before the carbon filter and pre-filter while it would be expected that the fan is after both these filters and the pre-filter is before the carbon filter to protect it. The proposed sound insulation is acceptable, but would request trading hours to cease at 11pm Monday to Saturday and 10pm Sundays and Bank Holidays.\r\rPublic Health Nutritionist - The site would be in close proximity to both Tolworth Girls School and Tolworth Hospital, as such restrictions should be placed on access to unhealthy options. Takeaways should not be within 400 metres walking distance from entrances and exits of an existing or proposed primary or secondary school. The applicant has not made reference to the type of food to be served which is of key relevance to the proposal.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The principle of the development; \r- The design of the proposed development;\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and, \r- The impact of the development on highways and transportation matters.\r\rPrincipal of Development\rOfficers note that whilst the site falls within a small parade of commercial units, it does not form part of a designated Local Centre. It is understood that it last operated as a cafe. In relation to surrounding uses the proposed change of use in this case would not be incompatible or dissimilar to the existing. Neither would it result in a predominance of Sui Generis uses in the area.\r\rOfficers also note that the proposed fast food takeaway would not sit within 400m walking distance from any entrances or exits of an existing or proposed primary or secondary school and therefore would be compliant with the objectives of Policy DM21 of the Core Strategy.\r\rThe applicant asserts that the premises has been vacant for a year, although no evidence has been submitted to substantiate this. Notwithstanding, the proposal is considered not to result in a loss of employment land/floorspace and would therefore be compliant with the objectives of Policy DM17 of the Core Strategy.\r\rDesign\rThe proposed external changes would involve the installation of an extraction flue to the rear elevation of the property. It would not extend any more than 1m above the highest window head and as such officers consider the impact to the character to the surrounding area to be minimal. No changes are proposed to the front elevation of the property. \r\rOverall, the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rIn terms of controlling smells and odours the applicant has failed to provide an acoustic report, or details of the extraction system and as such has failed to demonstrate how smells and odours would be controlled on site and how the proposed development would not cause harm to the residential amenities of the neighbouring occupiers. Further, officers note that the proposed fan would be located before the carbon filter and pre-filter, where it is expected to be located after the filter and pre-filter. \r\rThe proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rIt is considered that in the event of an approval and subject to a condition to control the hours of operation, the proposed development would not result in undue noise or disturbance.\r\rHighways and Transportation\rWhile the application site has a PTAL Score of 1b (very low), officers consider that the change of use would not result in a significant intensification of activities on site and or trip generation. Despite the lack of parking provision associated with the site and the location of a bus stop on the road to the front of the premises, there would be sufficient opportunities for short stay parking (commensurate with the size and type of proposed use) on surrounding roads in close proximity of the site.  Therefore, the proposal is considered not to have an adverse impact upon on-street car parking provision, traffic congestion or highway safety over and above the existing use, thereby achieving compliance with Policy DM9 and DM10. \r\rConclusion\rThe scheme under consideration involves the change of use to Hot Food Take-Away - Sui Generis Use Class from Retail unit - E(a) Use Class and the installation of an extractor flue pipe.\r\rThe proposed development would have no adverse impacts on employment land and premises or health and well-being.  Neither would it have an unacceptable adverse impact upon character and appearance and or highways and transportation. These are all neutral matters.\r\rHowever, through the lack of an accoustic report or details of the proposed extraction system the applicant has failed to demonstrate how smells and odours would be controlled on site and how the proposed development would not cause harm to the residential amenities of the neighbouring occupiers. As such the proposal would fail to accord with policy DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012. Officers consider that this issue would significantly and demonstrably outweigh the benefits of granting permission, when assessed against the policies in the NPPF 2021 taken as a whole. It is therefore recommended that planning permission is refused.",
    "It is noted that the original permission 17/12989/FUL is required to be implemented within 3 years of the grant of planning permission. This date has now passed. There remain a number of outstanding pre-commencement planning conditions which have not been discharged.",

However, officers also note that there are a number of hip to gable extension already permitted along Endway such as No. 22 Directly opposite No.37 Endway and als No's. 6, 9, 11 and 13 Endway. The proposed development is therefore considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  It is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.",
    "--- Officer Report ---\r\rIntroduction\rThis application is of a nature where the Council's Constitution delegates the authority to make the decision to Officers rather than it being decided by a Committee of Councillors.  \r\rBefore preparing this summary report a Planning Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the relevant Development Plan policies and guidance, considered any relevant previous planning applications, and considered any comments made by those interested in the application such as consultees with specialist knowledge and nearby residents.\r \rBy indicating that the development proposal complies with relevant Development Plan policies, the planning officer is taking into account the information submitted with the application, any previous relevant applications, any comments received in connection with the application and any other case specific considerations which are material to the decision.\r\rThe Development Plan comprises:\r\rThe London Plan 2021;\rRBK Core Strategy 2012;\rKingston Town Centre Area Action Plan 2008; and,\rThe South London Waste Plan 2012.\r\rThis decision has been authorised by a Senior Officer (Authorising Officer) in the Development Management Service. Prior to endorsing the Planning Officer's recommendation, the Authorising Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the application documents, the relevant planning policies and guidance, any relevant history, and any representations received.\r\rObjections:\r2 neighbour objections have been received and summarised as follows.\r\r- Inappropriate design/layout; and,\r- Noise.\r\rThe objections have been addressed in the assessment. \r\rSurbiton CAAC have also objected to the siting of the A board. \r\rThe co-Chairs of the Surbiton Neighbourhood Planning Committee have authorised officers to make a delegated decision in this case. \r\rApplication Site\rThe site comprises a ground floor commercial unit located in the designated Surbiton District Centre and the Surbiton Town Centre Conservation Area. The host property is a locally listed building a non-designated heritage asset.\r\rAssessment\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; \r- The impact of the proposed devleopment on heritage assets; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r\rDesign and Heritage\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS) (2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rSection 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended) places a duty on local planning authorities to pay special attention to the desirability of preserving or enhancing the character and appearance of conservation areas, when considering development proposals that would affect land or buildings within them.                                                                                                                  \rParagraphs 189 to 208 of the NPPF set out the method for assessing the impact of development proposals on heritage assets. Policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 echo these requirements.\r\rWhen considering the impact of a proposed development on the significance of a designated heritage asset, great weight should be given to the asset's conservation (and the more important the asset, the greater the weight should be). This is irrespective of whether any potential harm amounts to substantial harm, total loss or less than substantial harm to its significance.\r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is also considered that the tables and chairs, jumberellas and A board would not compete with and would be a subordinate addition to the host property, a locally listed building. The special architectural features and historic interest of the building would be preserved, the proposal would not create visual clutter and would sit comfortably in the foreground of the building, as well as provide visual interest and stimulus in the streetscene. As such, the proposed development would not result in any harm to the character or appearance of the area and would preserve the character and appearance of the Surbiton Town Conservation Area. It is considerd that the proposal would not impede the free flow of pedestrian movement in and around the site and the building would maintain access for all. The presence of an A board on site would be in keeping with that of other propeties in the road and would be removed daily when the unit is not in use and this would be secured by condition.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  It is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. The seating area would be restricted by condition in terms of the hours in which it can be used 9.30am - 9.30pm Mon - Sat and 10.00am - 8.30pm Sun and Bank holidays. This is to mitigate noise pollution to neighbouring residential occupiers beyond unsociable hours.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r\rDetails of the Application Submission\rIn accordance with the requirements of Local Government Act 1972 details of the application submission were available on the Council's website during the assessment of the application.\r\rhttps://www.kingston.gov.uk/info/200155/planning_applications_and_permissions/263/find_a_planning_application_or_appeal\r\r--- Informatives ---\r\rPositive and Proactive\rIn dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way.  We have made available detailed advice in the form or our statutory policies in the Core Strategy, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably.",
    "The site comprises a ground floor flat within a detached property.\r\r16 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations have been received. \r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings. \r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: Officers note that the proposed outbuilding would have a modest footprint and height, and as such would appear a subordinate addition to the host property. Given the modest footprint, the proposed development would ensure that approx 77sqm of amenity space is retained, and as such officers consider the proposed development, whilst visible above the hedge line, to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development. \r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rOfficer Comment: Given the modest scale and siting of the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. \r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
    "Application Site\rThe site comprises a semi-detached dwelling within the Cranes Park  Local Area of Special Character. The site is not located within a Conservation Area and there are no Tree Preservation Orders (TPOs) applicable to the site or neighbouring properties.\r\rProposal\rErection of single storey rear extension\r\rConsultation\rFour neighbouring properties have been notified and no representations have been received.\r\rAssessment\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; \r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\r- The impact of the development on the Cranes Park  Local Area of Special Character.\r\rDesign\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment: The rear of the property already benefits from a single storey rear extension. The proposal would be to infill the area to the rear of the property up to the boundary of No. 11 Lingfield Avenue.  Officers acknowledge the proposed works would be visible from Geneva Road. However, the existing rear extensions are already visible so no further harm has been identified to the character and appearance of the local area of special character. The proposed development is therefore considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: The principle property to be considered in relation to amenity is No. 9 Lingfield Road.  With regards to No. 11 Lingfield Avenue, Officers note that an application has also been submitted for a similar extension (21/01630/HOU) which would be built to the boundary of No. 9. It has been proposed that both extensions, if permitted will be built out at the same time. This would therefore result in no harm to the amenity of both properties as a result. This has been discussed with the applicant and in order to ensure both extensions are completed at the same time a pre commencement condition will be added if approved to secure this element of the build.  It is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.",
    "Application Site\rThe site comprises a semi-detached dwelling.\r\rProposal\rErection of two storey side extension, part two storey rear extension, conversion of garage into habitable space and single storey outbuilding (office, cinema, storage and w.c) to rear garden\r\rConsultation\rFive neighbouring properties have been notified and no representations have been received.\r\rAssessment\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; \r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\r- The impact of the development on the Highways and sustainable travel\r\rDesign\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment: Officers note that a number of surrounding properties already benefit from this type of side extension including neighbouring No 87 and No. 89 Hook Rise South. The proposed first floor side extension has been set back from front elevation and below the existing ridge height with a matching roof pitch to the existing. Access to the rear of the property has also been maintained to decrease the terracing effect. In relation to the proposed outbuilding officers note that a similar outbuilding has already been permitted.(21/01652/CPU dated 15.07.2021) The proposed outbuilding would be of the same footprint but will have a crown roof instead of a flat roof. As the outbuilding is to the rear of the property, officer could not identify any harm caused to the character and appearance of the area.  The proposed development is therefore considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  In relation to neighbouring amenity the principle properties to be considered are No. 89 and No. 93 Hook Rise South. In relation to No. 89 Hook Rise South, due to the existing situation it is not consider the proposed two storey extension would lead to overbearing appearance or loss of light. In relation to No. 93 Hook Rise South, the Single storey element, due to its limited depth would also not lead to overbearing appearance or loss of light. It is therefore considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rCar Parking\rPolicy T6 of the London Plan 2021 states that car parking should be restricted in line with levels of existing and future public transport accessibility and connectivity. The maximum standards as set out in policies T6.1 to T6.5 should be applied to development proposals. Where provided, each motorcycle parking space should count towards the maximum for car parking spaces at all use classes.\r\rPolicy DM9, Policy DM10 and the Council's Sustainable Transport SPD 2013 together require development proposals to comply with the car parking standards in the London Plan.\r\rOfficer Comment: Despite the loss of the existing garage, it is considered that the hardstanding to the front of the dwelling remains of an adequate size to accommodate two off street car parking spaces, therefore the proposal would comply with the Policy DM9 and DM10.\r\rSustainable Travel\rPolicy T5 of the London Plan 2021 states that developments should provide cycle parking at least in accordance with the minimum standards set out in Table 10.2 and Figure 10.3, ensuring that a minimum of two short-stay and two long-stay cycle parking spaces are provided.\r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed development would not result in the loss of access to the rear garden from the front of the property so despite the loss of the garage, secure cycle parking can still be achieved in the rear garden.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.",

    "Application Site\rThe site comprises a detached dwelling. Although detached, the property is in close proximity to No. 85 St Albans Road.\r\rProposal\rErection of part single storey and part two storey rear extension including creation of a light well. Rear piggy back roof extension with installation of 7no rooflights, 1no front and 3no rear gable windows to facilitate loft conversion. Associated changes to fenestration\r\rThis application follows previously refused application 21/00046/HOU dated 22.03.2021 which was refused for the following reason:\r\rThe lack of set-back from the front elevation and the excessive height of the proposed piggyback extension would result in a prominent and incongruous feature which would detract from the character and appearance of the existing site and surrounding area.

As such and in this specific regard the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. In terms of the other aspects of the proposal it is considered that there would be no unacceptable adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  It is acknowledged that there would be some loss of daylight/sunlight to a ground floor side elevation window at No. 85, however, the window in question would appear to be an obscurely glazed non-habitable bathroom window (ref: 19/01094/HOU). As such, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy to an unacceptable degree.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.",

    "Officer Report\r\rIntroduction\rThis application is of a nature where the Council's Constitution delegates the authority to make the decision to Officers rather than it being decided by a Committee of Councillors.  \r\rBefore preparing this summary report a Planning Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the relevant Development Plan policies and guidance, considered any relevant previous planning applications, and considered any comments made by those interested in the application such as consultees with specialist knowledge and nearby residents.\r \rBy indicating that the development proposal complies with relevant Development Plan policies, the planning officer is taking into account the information submitted with the application, any previous relevant applications, any comments received in connection with the application and any other case specific considerations which are material to the decision.\r\rThis decision has been authorised by a Senior Officer (Authorising Officer) in the Development Management Service. Prior to endorsing the Planning Officer's recommendation, the Authorising Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the application documents, the relevant planning policies and guidance, any relevant history, and any representations received.\r\rSection 38(6) of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004 states that planning applications must be determined in accordance with the development plan unless material considerations indicate otherwise.\r\rThe development plan for the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames comprises the following documents:\r\r- The London Plan 2021\r- The South London Waste Plan 2012 \r- The LDF Core Strategy 2012\r- The Kingston Town Centre Area Action Plan 2008\r\rApplication Site\r\rThe application site is occupied by a two storey semi detached building located on the northern side of Sandal Road.\r\rProposal\r\rPlanning permission is sought for the erection of a hip to gable and rear dormer roof extensions with installation of 4no front rooflights to facilitate loft conversion.\r\rThis application follows a lawful development certificate (21/00969/CPU) that was refused for the same development.\r\rConsultation\r3 properties were notified of the proposal. No representations were received.\r\rAssessment\rThe main issues in the assessment of the application are:\r- The planning history of the property\r- The impact of the development on the character and appearance of the area; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of neighbouring occupiers.\r\rPlanning history of the application property is a material consideration. An application for permitted development (21/00969/CPU) was refused for the following reason: \r\rIt has not been demonstrated, on the balance of probabilities, that the cubic content of the resulting roof space would not exceed the cubic content of the original roof space by more than 50 cubic metres. It has also not been confirmed that the materials would be similar in appearance to those used in the construction of the exterior of the existing dwellinghouse. The proposed development would fail to comply with part B1.(d) (ii) and condition B.2(a) of Class B, Part 1, Schedule 2 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).\r\rThe current proposal makes no changes to the permitted development application.  The test therefore is whether this proposal is acceptable in its own right having regard to the parameters of the GPDO, in addition to other relevant policy guidance.\r\rCharacter and Appearance\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rPolicies 39 and 40 of the Residential Design SPD state that when considering roof extension such as dormer windows and gable end extensions, that dormer windows are set down from the ridge line of the existing roof slope, set in form the sides and elves of the roof by 500mm and do not feature on the front roof slope. Gable end extensions are not usually appropriate as they are often at odds with the existing character of the (semi detached) property and upset the visual balance of the two houses when viewed in the context of other houses in the street or wider area. \r\rOfficers consider that the proposed hip to gable and rear dormer roof extensions, notably the former would alter the appearance of the property, and change the symmetry and visual balance of the application property and No.10 Sandal Road. \r\rHowever, it is a highly material consideration that both the hip to gable and rear dormer extensions, with a very minor amendment/reduction in cubic content, would likely fall within the parameters of permitted development and on the evidence before officers, there would be nothing to prevent the applicant from carrying out the development in this way. Taking account of the comparable fall-back position, officers consider that the proposal is, on balance, in accordance with policies D3 and HC1 of the London Plan and policies DM10 and DM12 of the Core Strategy.\r\rHaving regard to the above, officers consider that the proposed development, whilst not representing the best design and not following the design guidance in the Residential Design SPD, would, when viewed in light of the highly material consideration i.e. with a minor amendment, both the hip to gable and rear dormer roof extensions would likely fall within the parameters of permitted development,  be no more harmful than such a similar development carried out under permitted development. On balance officers consider that the proposal is in accordance with policies D3 and HC1 of the London Plan and policies DM10 and DM12 of the Core Strategy.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rThere is an existing window at first floor level to the side elevation of No.12 Sandal Road. Outlook from this north facing window is already limited given its location (facing a brick wall) and separation distance from the application property. \r\rOfficers note the lawful development certificate was refused on the grounds that the proposed hip to gable and rear dormer roof extension would exceed the cubic content of the original roof space by more than 50 cubic metres. However, with a minor reduction in the cubic content permitted development rights would apply. \r\rTaking this into account, although the proposal may result in some loss of light to the window in the side elevation of No. 12, the level of outlook from this window is unlikely to be any worse as a result of the current development, than experienced through the same proposal under permitted development. \r\rWindows to the proposed roof extensions are either rooflights or located to the rear elevation, with the outlook directed to the rear of the application property. \r\rOfficers are therefore satisfied that the proposal would not appear overbearing or result in any undue loss of light to neighbouring occupiers. Having regard to the above, officers consider that the impact of the proposed development on the amenities of neighbouring occupiers would be acceptable.\r\rConclusion\r\rOfficers consider that the proposed development would result in material harm to the character and appearance of the area. However, having regard to the permitted development fallback position, officers consider the proposal to be in accordance with policies D3 and HC1 of the London Plan and policies DM10 and DM12 of the Core Strategy. \r\rHaving regard to the above, officers consider the proposal to be in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole. In the absence of any other material considerations which indicate that permission should be refused, officers conclude that planning permission should be granted.\r\rBackground Papers\rIn accordance with the requirements of Local Government Act 1972 The Plans / Drawings / Documents submitted with the application are available on the Council's website.\r\rhttps://www.kingston.gov.uk/info/200155/planning_applications_and_permissions/263/find_a_planning_application_or_appeal\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r",
    "---OFFICER REPORT---\r\rIntroduction\rThis application is of a nature where the Council's Constitution delegates the authority to make the decision to Officers rather than it being decided by a Committee of Councillors.  \r\rBefore preparing this summary report a Planning Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site and its planning history, the relevant legislation and guidance, considered any relevant case law, and considered any comments made by those interested in the application such as consultees with specialist knowledge and nearby residents.\r\rApplication Site\rThe site comprises a single storey, brick-built building attached to the north-eastern end of a row of garages adjacent to Lakeside (a block of residential flats), Eaton Drive.\r\rProposal\rThe application seeks a lawful development certificate for the existing use of the building as an estate office falling within Class E of Schedule 2 to the Use Classes Order.\r\rConsultation\rN/A.\r\rLegislation\rThe application is made pursuant to Section 191 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended).\r\rSection 191(2) of the Act reads:\r(2) For the purposes of this Act uses and operations are lawful at any time if—\r(a) no enforcement action may then be taken in respect of them (whether because they did not involve development or require planning permission or because the time for enforcement action has expired or for any other reason); and\r(b) they do not constitute a contravention of any of the requirements of any enforcement notice then in force.\r\rSection 191(4) of the Act reads:\r(4) If, on an application under this section, the local planning authority are provided with information satisfying them of the lawfulness at the time of the application of the use, operations or other matter described in the application, or that description as modified by the local planning authority or a description substituted by them, they shall issue a certificate to that effect; and in any other case they shall refuse the application.\r\rSection 171B of the Act reads:\r(1) Where there has been a breach of planning control consisting in the carrying out without planning permission of building, engineering, mining or other operations in, on, over or under land, no enforcement action may be taken after the end of the period of four years beginning with the date on which the operations were substantially completed.\r(2) Where there has been a breach of planning control consisting in the change of use of any building to use as a single dwellinghouse, no enforcement action may be taken after the end of the period of four years beginning with the date of the breach.\r(3) In the case of any other breach of planning control, no enforcement action may be taken after the end of the period of ten years beginning with the date of the breach.\r\rThe Applicable Test\rIn light of the above, the test is whether, on the balance of probability, the building was used as an estate office falling within Class E of Schedule 2 to the Use Classes Order for a period of ten years ending with the date the application was made.\r\rGuidance\rParagraph reference 17c-005-20140306 of the NPPG reads:\rAn application needs to describe precisely what is being applied for (not simply the use class) and the land to which the application relates. Without sufficient or precise information, a local planning authority may be justified in refusing a certificate. This does not preclude another application being submitted later on, if more information can be produced.\r\rParagraph reference 17c-006-20140306 of the NPPG reads:\rThe applicant is responsible for providing sufficient information to support an application, although a local planning authority always needs to cooperate with an applicant who is seeking information that the authority may hold about the planning status of the land. A local planning authority is entitled to canvass evidence if it so wishes before determining an application. If a local planning authority obtains evidence, this needs to be shared with the applicant who needs to have the opportunity to comment on it and possibly produce counter-evidence.\r \rIn the case of applications for existing use, if a local planning authority has no evidence itself, nor any from others, to contradict or otherwise make the applicant's version of events less than probable, there is no good reason to refuse the application, provided the applicant's evidence alone is sufficiently precise and unambiguous to justify the grant of a certificate on the balance of probability.\r\rParagraph reference 17c-008-20140306 of the NPPG reads:\rThere is no statutory requirement to consult third parties including parish councils or neighbours. It may, however, be reasonable for a local planning authority to seek evidence from these sources, if there is good reason to believe they may possess relevant information about the content of a specific application. Views expressed by third parties on the planning merits of the case, or on whether the applicant has any private rights to carry out the operation, use or activity in question, are irrelevant when determining the application.\r\rThe Evidence\rThe applicant has described the use of the building as an estate office and has stated that the building has been in this use since its construction in 1967. The applicant considers this use to fall within Class B1(a) of the Schedule to the Use Classes Order 1987 (as amended), as it existed prior to its amendment in September 2020. This former use class now makes up part of Class E of Schedule 2 to the Use Classes Order.\r\rAlthough the applicant has provided very little evidence to demonstrate that the building has been used as an estate office for the period of time stated, officers have no evidence to contradict this version of events and consequently do not dispute it. However, it is much more doubtful that this use falls within Class E. The applicant has not described the activities carried out from the building in any detail, but the typical purpose of an estate office is to assist with the management of an estate i.e. maintenance of the buildings and grounds, and providing general assistance to occupants. In other words, an estate office has a supporting function within a wider estate and in this sense, is functionally inseparable from that estate.\r\rOn the available evidence, officers consider that this is the purpose the application building fulfills, i.e. it is ancillary to the wider use of the estate as a residential block of flats and associated amenities, which is a use falling within Class C3 of Schedule 1 to the Use Classes Order. It follows that, on the balance of probability, the building was not used for a use falling within Class E of Schedule 2 to the Use Classes Order for a period of ten years ending with the date the application was made. Accordingly, officers conclude that the application should be refused.\r\rDetails of the Application Submission\rIn accordance with the requirements of Local Government Act 1972 details of the application submission were available on the Council's website during the assessment of the application.\r\rhttps://www.kingston.gov.uk/info/200155/planning_applications_and_permissions/263/find_a_planning_application_or_appeal\r\r---END OF OFFICER REPORT---",
    "--- Officer Report ---\r\rIntroduction\rThis application is of a nature where the Council's Constitution delegates the authority to make the decision to Officers rather than it being decided by a Committee of Councillors.  \r\rBefore preparing this summary report a Planning Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the relevant Development Plan policies and guidance, considered any relevant previous planning applications, and considered any comments made by those interested in the application such as consultees with specialist knowledge and nearby residents.\r \rBy indicating that the development proposal complies with relevant Development Plan policies, the planning officer is taking into account the information submitted with the application, any previous relevant applications, any comments received in connection with the application and any other case specific considerations which are material to the decision.\r\rThe Development Plan comprises:\r\rThe London Plan 2021;\rRBK Core Strategy 2012;\rKingston Town Centre Area Action Plan 2008; and,\rThe South London Waste Plan 2012.\r\rThis decision has been authorised by a Senior Officer (Authorising Officer) in the Development Management Service. Prior to endorsing the Planning Officer's recommendation, the Authorising Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the application documents, the relevant planning policies and guidance, any relevant history, and any representations received.\r\rApplication Site\rThe site comprises a semi detached residential dwelling.\r\rThe buildings on site are not listed, or locally listed and the site does not fall within a conservation area. However, the site falls within Flood Risk Zone 2 (medium probability).\r\rProposal\rThe application seeks the erection of a single storey side and rear extension.\r\rConsultation\r10 properties were notified of the proposal. 1 objection was received. The material issues raised are summarised as follows:\r- Excessive scale and depth;\r- Inappropriate form;\r- Fails to respect symmetry with adjoining property; and,\r- Terracing effect.\r\rAssessment\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; \r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\r-The impact of the proposed development on flood risk.\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS) (2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  It is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rFlood Risk\rParagraph 167 of the NPPF states that when determining any planning applications, local planning authorities should ensure that flood risk is not increased elsewhere. Where appropriate, applications should be supported by a site-specific flood risk assessment. This includes all development within Flood Zones 2 and 3.\r\rPolicy SI12 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM4 of the Council's Core strategy 2012 require development proposals to accord with the flood risk policies set out in the NPPF.\r\rOfficer Comment: As stated above the application site falls within Flood Risk Zone 2 (medium probability). Consequently the Flood Risk Assessment: Standing Advice issued by the Environment Agency and DEFRA, 2012 must be applied. For minor extensions such as this it is essential that the proposed floor level is no lower than existing in order to mitigate future flood risk impacts. \r\rThe Flood Risk Assessment submitted by the applicant indicates that floor levels within the proposed development would be set no lower than the main dwelling and appropriate mitigation measures would be implemented as part of the proposed development which are considered acceptable and in accordance with Policy SI12 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM4 of the LDF Core Strategy (2012).\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r\rDetails of the Application Submission\rIn accordance with the requirements of Local Government Act 1972 details of the application submission were available on the Council's website during the assessment of the application.\r\rhttps://www.kingston.gov.uk/info/200155/planning_applications_and_permissions/263/find_a_planning_application_or_appeal\r\r--- Informatives ---\r\rPositive and Proactive\rIn dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way.  We have made available detailed advice in the form or our statutory policies in the Core Strategy, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably.\r\rBuilding Regulations\rYour attention is drawn to the need to comply with the relevant provisions of the Building Regulations, the Building Acts and other related legislation.  These cover such works as  - the demolition of existing buildings, the erection of a new building or structure, the extension or alteration to a building, change of use of buildings, installation of services, underpinning works, and fire safety/means of escape works.  Notice of intention to demolish existing buildings must be given to the Council's Building Control Service at least 6 weeks before work starts.  A completed application form together with detailed plans must be submitted for approval before any building work is commenced.\r\rParty Wall Act\rThe Party Wall Act 1996 requires a building owner to notify, and obtain formal agreement from, any adjoining owner, where the building owner proposes to:\r\r- carry out work to an existing party wall;\r- build on the boundary with a neighbouring property;\r- in some circumstances, carry out groundworks within 6 metres of an adjoining building.\r\rNotification and agreements under this Act are the responsibility of the building owner and are quite separate from Building Regulations, or Planning Controls.  The Building Control Service will assume that an applicant has obtained any necessary agreements with the adjoining owner, and nothing said or implied by the Council should be taken as removing the necessity for the building owner to comply fully with the Party Wall Act. Further information and advice is to be found in \"The Party Walls etc. Act 1996 - Explanatory Booklet\".\r\rProperty Boundaries\rYour attention is drawn to the fact that planning permission does not override property rights, and that if your proposal involves construction on or near the site boundary then you should take appropriate steps to ensure that you have correctly identified the position of the boundary, that you do not build over it, and that any works which affect a neighbours property in any way have the benefit of the appropriate agreement from that landowner. Failure to undertake the above steps may leave you liable to legal action by neighbouring landowners. If you require further information or advice, you should consult a solicitor.\r\rConsistency of Plans\rReasonable efforts have been made to check that the plans submitted for the purposes of this planning application are consistent from one to the next, and that the development hereby approved can be implemented in accordance with all of the plans submitted. Should it transpire that this is not possible and that your plans are flawed, please be clear that it may be impossible to implement this permission, and that any development undertaken which relies on this permission may be unauthorised and subject to enforcement action if expedient.\r\rConstruction Site Noise\rWhen undertaking demolition and/or noisy building work, please be considerate to your neighbours and do not undertake work before 8am or after 6pm Monday to Friday, before 8am or after 1pm on a Saturday or at any time on Sundays or Bank Holidays.  \r\rYou are advised that the Council does have formal powers to control noise and nuisance under The Control of Pollution Act 1974, the Clean Air Acts and other relevant legislation, and that any works undertaken which impact unreasonably upon the surrounding area may be subject to action by the Council's Environmental Health Department.\r\rDefinition of Approved in Writing\rWhere reference is made within the decision notice to a condition applying 'unless otherwise agreed in writing with the local planning authority', please be aware that only a formal application under section 73 or 96a of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (As Amended) is acceptable as a method of said written agreement.\r\rGround Level / Base Level\rUnless clearly specified otherwise, the base of the development shown on the approved plans is taken to be external ground level, and not a Damp Proof Course or Internal Finished Floor Level. The external ground level is expected to remain consistent before and after construction of the approved development unless specified otherwise on the approved plans.",
    "Application Site\rThe site comprises a semi-detached dwelling within the Cranes Park  Local Area of Special Character. The site is not located within a Conservation Area and there are no Tree Preservation Orders (TPOs) applicable to the site or neighbouring properties.\r\rProposal\rErection of single storey side/rear extension\r\rConsultation\rTwenty neighbouring properties have been notified and no representations have been received.\r\rAssessment\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; \r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\r- The impact of the development on the Cranes Park  Local Area of Special Character.\r\rDesign\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment: The rear of the property already benefits from a single storey rear extension. The proposal would be to infill the area to the rear of the property up to the boundary of No. 9 Lingfield Avenue.  Officers acknowledge the proposed works would be visible from Geneva Road. However, the existing rear extensions are already visible so no further harm has been identified to the character and appearance of the local area of special character. The proposed development is therefore considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: The principle properties to be considered in relation to amenity are No. 9 and No. 13 Lingfield Road. In relation to No. 13, due to the existing situation it is not considered that the proposed infill extension would have a detrimental effect to the amenity. With regards to No. 9 Lingfield Avenue, Officers note that an application has also been submitted for a similar extension (21/01624/HOU) which would be built to the boundary of No. 11. It has been proposed that both extensions, if permitted will be built out at the same time. This would therefore result in no harm to the amenity of both properties as a result. This has been discussed with the applicant and in order to ensure both extensions are completed at the same time a pre commencement condition will be added if approved to secure this element of the build.  It is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.",
