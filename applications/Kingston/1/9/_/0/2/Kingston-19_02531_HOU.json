    "The proposed roof alterations and dormer window would, by virtue of the proposed roof dormer not being set down from the ridge line, set in from the side elevation and up from the eaves would not accord with Section 3.5 of the London Plan for Quality Housing, Policy Guidance 39 (Dormer Windows) of the Residential Design SPD and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's LDF Core Strategy. Therefore, the proposed roof alterations and dormers layout and design would appear as an incongruous addition to the host dwelling and wider locality and as such would appear harmful to the character and appearance of the surrounding area.",
    "There is a requirement to make alterations to vehicular access(s). Applicants should note the provisions of section 184 of the Highways Act 1980. The works should be carried out to the satisfaction of the Council and you will be required to pay fees to cover the Councils costs in undertaking the approval and inspection of the works.",
    "Please be advised that a fee of Â£407 is required for this application. This can be paid either online at www.kingston.gov.uk or by calling our Customer Service Team on 020 8547 5002\r"
