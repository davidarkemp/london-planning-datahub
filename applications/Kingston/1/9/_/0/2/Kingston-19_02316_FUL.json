    "The substandard access would prejudice the condition of highway safety, the proposal would also lead to conflict between pedestrians, cyclists and vehicles and would not encourage cycling or walking modes of transport. The proposal is therefore contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), Policy 6.13 of the London Plan (2016), Policies DM9 and DM10 of the adopted Local Development Framework Core Strategy (2012).",
    "The applicant has failed to submit a Unilateral Undertaking to prevent future occupiers from applying for residents parking permits, the proposal is therefore unacceptable in highways terms. As such, the proposal in this respect is considered to conflict with the National Planning Policy Framework (2019),  Policy 6.13 of the London Plan (2016) and Policies DM9 and DM10 of the adopted  Local Development Framework Core Strategy (2012).",
    "Unless clearly specified otherwise, the base of the development shown on the approved plans is taken to be external ground level and not a Damp Proof Course or Internal Finished Floor Level. The external ground level is expected to remain consistent before and after construction of the approved development unless specified otherwise on the approved plans.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way.  We have made available detailed advice in the form or our statutory policies in the Core Strategy, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably.",

    "Please confirm description of proposed works. \"Erection of 1 no. x 3 bedroom detached additional dwelling\"",
    "Inspection:\rSite inspection carried out as a desktop exercise with information provided by the applicant as supporting material to application.\r\rAssessment:\rAs evidenced by photos recieved in an email, the trees are clearly dead and should be removed for reasons of health and safety due to their being adjacent to a major road. However, while the Horse Chestnut is covered by the TPO, the Cypress is not.\r\rRecommendation:\rApprove with condition for 1 replacement planting.",
    "Inspection:\rSite inspection carried out as a desktop exercise with information provided by the applicant as supporting material to application.\r\rAssessment:\rMinor works with no adverse impact upon public amenity within the Conservation Area.\r\rRecommendation:\rNo objections."
