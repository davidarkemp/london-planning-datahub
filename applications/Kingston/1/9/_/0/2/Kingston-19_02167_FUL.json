    "The application site is prominently located on the corner plot of Wood Street within Kingston Town Centre. The building lies immediately opposite the Grade II listed Bentall Shopping Centre to the east, which is connected to the multi-storey car park located to the rear of Anstee House by an elevated, covered footpath. The building is positioned approximately 170m from the eastern bank of the River Thames, which flows through Kingston upon Thames.\r\rAnstee House is a three-storey building with a self-contained, ground floor entrance and reception area. The first and second floors are currently fitted out for educational purposes to cater for Kingston College's former occupation of the building. The ground floor of the building is currently occupied by a food outlet, with the third floor of the building housing a plant room. The main frontal elevation of the building fronts Wood Street and gradually curves round onto Steadfast Road to the west. \r\rThe application site is not located within a conservation area and no TPOs are recorded on site. The application site falls within Flood Zone 2.\r\rThe application seeks planning permission for change of use at first and second floor level from F1 (non-residential education) to E (Commercial). Kingston College were the previous occupants of the premises. The proposed change would be wholly internal and no external works have been proposed. It is noted that the host site was previously in use as offices under class B1 until changed to D1 under application 08/12332/FUL in 2008.\r\rThe main considerations when making an assessment of the application are the impacts of the proposed change of use upon the policy requirements of the site. The principal of the change of use from a D1 use has been established under planning permission Ref 19/00966/FUL.\r\rThe proposed change of use from D1 to E would require no external alterations and therefore would not impact the character or appearance of the existing property or surrounding area. Any potential internal alterations would reflect the existing and therefore would not cause harm to the area.  \r\rAs such, given that there would be no external alterations to the property, the proposed development would not detract from the character and appearance of the host property and the surrounding area and therefore would accord with Policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Council's adopted LFD Core Strategy April 2012.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's LDF Core Strategy (2012) seeks to safeguard residential amenities in terms of privacy, outlook, daylight /sunlight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rThe application proposes a change of use to Use Class E, however, no information has been submitted to demonstrate that the potential impacts of the development from all uses contained within Use Class E, namely (a),(b),(d),(e),(f),(g)(iii), have been assessed.\r\rA change of use Class E(c) and E (g)(i), and (g) (ii) to would reflect a similar footfall than that as existing therefore is not considered to cause a level of noises or disturbance greater than existing. The proposed works would be wholly internal and therefore would not impact upon neighbouring sunlight, privacy or overlooking.\r\rSubject to the conditions listed, the development would be acceptable in planning terms.",
