    "The proposed front boundary treatment by reason of its scale and height would be out of character with the streetscene and the surrounding area. In addition the applicant has failed to provide sufficient details in terms of the proposed materials to ensure a satisfactory appearance upon completion of development. The proposal would therefore be contrary to  Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy, the Kingston Residential Design SPD 2012 or advice in the National Planning Policy Framework and the National Planning Practice Guidance.",
    "The applicant has not demonstrated beyond the balance of probabilities that the proposal would not have an unacceptable adverse impact upon highway safety, thereby conflicting with Policy DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy, the Kingston Residential Design SPD 2012 or advice in the National Planning Policy Framework and the National Planning Practice Guidance.",
    "B.2 (a) states that the materials used in any exterior work shall be of a similar appearance to those used in the construction of the exterior of the existing dwellinghouse.\r\rThe face and sides of a dormer window should be finished using materials that give a similar visual appearance to the existing house, i.e. the facing materials used for the dormer should appear to be of similar design, colour and texture to the materials used in the main roof of the house when viewed from ground level. Window frames should also be similar to those in the existing house in terms of their colour and overall design. \r\rThe proposed use of render would not match the existing roof tiles.\r",
    "Please confirm description of proposed works \"Mixed use development including retention of 127 Chiltern Drive, demolition of all other buildings and erection of 2no. buildings for flexible commercial floorspace at ground floor and residential accommodation on upper floors, comprising 43 units, with associated access, landscaping, car parking, cycle parking and refuse storage\"\r\rPlease also amend application form (section 6) to reflect and return a copy to this office.",
