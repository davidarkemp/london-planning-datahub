    "The proposed development, by virtue of its disruptive flat roof design and the bulk and mass of the second storey, would create a visually intrusive form of development that would be out of keeping with the appearance of the streetscape and would be detrimental to the character of the surrounding area. The proposal is therefore contrary to policy CP30 of the Core Strategy (2010), Policies DMD6, DMD8 and DMD37 of the Development Management Document (2014), Policy D4 of The London Plan (2021) and guidance contained within the National Planning Policy Framework (2021)."
