    "In the absence of an adequate SuDs Strategy and Flood Risk Assessment, the proposed scheme fails to appropriately consider and mitigate the risk of flooding from all potential sources and utilise Sustainable Urban Drainage Systems (SuDS) following the drainage hierarchy in the London Plan. Therefore, it is considered the scheme would be unsafe over its lifetime, taking into account the impact of climate change. In view of this, the proposal is contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework 2024, policies SI12 and SI13 of the London Plan 2021 Policies, CP21, CP28 and CP29 of the Core Strategy 2010, Policies DMD60, DMD61, DMD62 and DMD63 of the Development Management Document 2014 and the Enfield Strategic Flood Risk Assessment."
