    "The proposed development, by virtue of its insufficient provision of private amenity space, lack of dual aspect, poor quality of outlook, and insufficient natural light would result in substandard and inappropriate accommodation incapable of meeting the reasonable needs of future occupiers. The proposal is therefore contrary to Section 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2024), Policies D3, D4, D6 of the London Plan (2021), Policy CP30 of the Enfield Core Strategy (2010) and Policies DMD6, DMD8 and DMD9 of the Enfield Development Management Document (2014).",
    "The proposed development, by virtue of its height, form, siting, bulk, location forward of the front building line, projection and proximity to the site boundaries would give rise to an unneighbourly loss of outlook, as perceived from neighbouring properties including Nos. 17 & 19 Brecon Road and No. 1 Tenby Road. The proposal is therefore contrary to Section 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2024), Policies D3, D4 and D8 of the London Plan (2021), Policies CP4 and CP30 of the Enfield Core Strategy (2010), Policies DMD6, DMD8, DMD10 and DMD37 of the Enfield Development Management Document (2014) and the London Housing Supplementary Planning Guidance (2016).",
    "The proposed development, by virtue of its projection, alignment, detailed design, form, siting, bulk, roof form, front boundary wall, proximity to the site boundaries, and extent of site coverage, would result in a cramped form of development which would appear visually intrusive, incongruous, overly dominant and out of keeping with the pattern of surrounding development and would constitute an overdevelopment of the site. The proposal is therefore contrary to Section 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2024), Policies D3, D4, D8 of the London Plan (2021), Policy CP30 of the Enfield Core Strategy (2010), and Policies DMD6, DMD8, DMD11, DMD13 and DMD37 of the Enfield Development Management Document (2014).",
    "The proposed development, in the absence of an adequate sustainable drainage strategy, fails to demonstrate how proposed measures manage the risk of flooding and utilise Sustainable Urban Drainage Systems (SuDS) following the drainage hierarchy in the London Plan. The proposal is therefore contrary to Section 14 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2024), Policies SI 12 and SI 13 of the London Plan (2021), Policies CP21 and CP28 of the Enfield Core Strategy (2010), Policies DMD59, DMD60, DMD61, DMD62 of the Enfield Development Management Document (2014) and the Enfield Strategic Flood Risk Assessment (2021).",
    "The proposed cycle storage, by virtue of its means of access, location and layout, would fail to provide a secure, convenient and high quality facility for all types of bicycles, and would fail to promote or prioritise the use of sustainable modes of transport. The proposal is therefore contrary to Section 9 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2024), Policies T5 and T7 of the London Plan (2021), Policies CP24 and CP25 of the Enfield Core Strategy (2010), and Policies DMD45, DMD47 andDMD48 of the Enfield Development Management Document (2014).",
    "The proposed refuse store, by reason of its constrained means of access, would fail to provide suitable storage for waste and recycling as required by adopted policy. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy DMD8 of the  Development Management Document (2014) and the Enfield Household Recycling and Waste Planning Guidance for New Developments (2024).  \r\r\r"
