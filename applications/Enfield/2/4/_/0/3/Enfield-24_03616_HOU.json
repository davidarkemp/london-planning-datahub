    "The proposed extensions, by virtue of design, form, bulk, scale and siting would represent a dominant and obtrusive form of development that fails to relate to, or appear subservient to the original dwelling and would be disproportionate to the established character, form and pattern of development, detrimental to the visual amenities of the subject property and surrounding area. The proposals are thereby contrary to Policies D4 of the London Plan (2021), Core Strategy (2010) Policy CP30 and Development Management Document (2014) Policies DMD8, DMD11, DMD14 and DMD37 and National Planning Policy Framework (2023)."
