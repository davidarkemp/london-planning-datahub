    "The proposed rear dormer, along with two rooflights on the front roof and the raising of the roof ridge, would, by virtue of their form, siting, and bulk within the roof plane, appear visually intrusive, incongruous, and overly dominant. This would be out of keeping with the character and appearance of the host building and the surrounding area. Consequently, the proposal would be contrary to Section 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2024), Policies D3, of the London Plan (2021), CP30 of the Enfield Core Strategy (2010), and Policies DMD6, DMD8, DMD13, and DMD37 of the Enfield Development Management Document (2014)."
