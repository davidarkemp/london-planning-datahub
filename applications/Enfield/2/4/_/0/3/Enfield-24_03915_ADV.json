    "The proposed advertisement, by virtue of its size, siting, prominent location on the building and method of illumination, would add prominent visual clutter and appear as an incongruous and unduly dominant addition, which would have a harmful effect on the visual amenity of the host building and the surrounding area of which it forms part, contrary to Sections 7 and 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2024), D8 of the London Plan (2021), CP30 of the Enfield Core Strategy (2010), DMD37 and DMD41 of the Enfield Development Management Document (2014) and the Enfield Shopfronts and Associated Advertisements Supplementary Planning Guidance.",
    "The proposed development, in the absence of adequate information regarding illumination, fails to demonstrate how proposed measures manage and operate to reduce neighbouring properties exposure to light pollution contrary to Section 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2024), Policies CP30 and CP32 of the Enfield Core Strategy (2010), DMD8 and DMD69 of the Enfield Development Management Document (2014)."
