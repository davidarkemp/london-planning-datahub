    "The proposed development, by virtue of its siting, scale, bulk, massing and overall design, incorporating an awkward juxtaposition of discordant gable end and hipped roof elements, poor pattern of fenestration and proximity to the site boundaries would result in an overly dominant and discordant form of development, which is out of keeping with the surrounding form and pattern of development and fails to contribute to the local environment, being detrimental to the character of the surrounding area and visual amenities of the street scene. The proposals are therefore contrary to the advice contained within the National Planning Policy Framework 2021, Policies  D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021); Policy CP30 of the Enfield Core Strategy (2010) and Policies DMD6, DMD8, DMD11, DMD14, DMD37 of the Enfield Development Management Document (2014), which together seek to achieve a high quality design.",
    "The proposed development by virtue of its siting, design, scale,, bulk and massing would result in an overly dominant impact to residential amenities through loss of outlook and sense of enclosure, which would adversely impact on the amenities of the occupiers at No. 189 Hertford Road. Moreover, in the absence of a daylight/sunlight assessment, the proposal fails to demonstrate if adequate daylight/sunlight would be provided to the habitable rooms and rear garden of No. 189 Hertford Road to the detriment of the amenities of the occupiers of this property. The proposed development is therefore contrary to Section 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy CP30 of the Core Strategy and Policies DMD8, DMD10 and DMD37 of the Development Management Document (2014).",
    "The proposed development by virtue of its single aspect design and absence of external amenity space to serve the upper floor unit would result in a substandard form of accommodation, detrimental to the living conditions of future occupiers of the development. The proposals are thereby contrary to the advice contained within the NPPF, Policies D6 of The London Plan (2021), CP4 of the Core Strategy (2010), DMD8 of the Development Management Document (2014) and the requirements of the London Plan Housing Supplementary Planning Guidance."
