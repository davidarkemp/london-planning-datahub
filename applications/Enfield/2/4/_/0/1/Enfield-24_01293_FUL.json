    "The open storage element of the development at the application site by virtue of its industrial use which falls under Use Class B8 is located outside of a designated Strategic Industrial Location (SIL) or Locally Significant Industrial Site (LSIS) and it fails to accord with the requirements of Policy DMD23 of the Development Management Document.",
    "The use of part of the site as storage area, due to the potentially frequent comings and goings of vehicles and by virtue of the general noise, activity and visual impact created by the proposed use would adversely affect the residential amenities of adjoining and nearby occupiers, contrary to policies CP30 and CP32 of the Core Strategy (2010), DMD68 of the Development Management Document (2014), D3 and D14 of the London Plan (2021), as well as the objectives of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023).",
    "The storage use, by virtue of its nature and function and associated materials would detract from the character and appearance of the Grade II listed building and its setting. The proposals are therefore contrary to policies DMD37 and DMD44 of the Development Management Document (2014), CP30 and CP31 of the Core Strategy (2010) and Policies D3 and HC1 of the London Plan (2021) as well as the advice and guidance contained within the National Planning Policy Framework (2023) and the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990.",
    "The proposed change of use due to lack of adequate information pertaining to servicing arrangements, car parking and cycle parking layout as well as refuse storage provisions commensurate with the more intensive use proposed, fails to provide sufficient information to demonstrate that the use would not give rise to conditions prejudicial to the free flow and safety of vehicular traffic, cyclists and pedestrians.  The proposed development would therefore be contrary to  Policies T4, T5 and T6 of the London Plan (2021), Policies CP24 and CP25 of the Core Strategy (2010), Policies DMD45, and DMD47 of the Enfield Development Management Document (2014)."
