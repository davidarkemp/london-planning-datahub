  "description": "Non-material amendment to ref: TP/95/0605 to allow amendments at ground level, the elimination of the staircase that provides access from the shop to the first floor flat, the abandonment of the rear extension to the shop and to use the space at the rear for refuse and recycling bins, for motorcar and bicycle parking and the provision of an access route to the goods entrance to the rear of the shop as shown on the drawings that are being submitted. At first floor level the amendments will include the redesign of a new entrance to the flats (accessed from an existing first-floor gallery at the rear) and the redesign of the floor plan at this level, which will be affected as a result of the new entrance/access arrangement.",
