    "The proposed office block and associated car park would result in the loss of land associated with industrial uses within the designated Locally Significant Industrial Site.  The proposed development is therefore contrary to Policy E6 of the London Plan (2021), CP 15 of the Core Policy (2010), DMD 20 and DMD 23 of the Development Management Document (2014) and the NPPF (2024).",
    "Insufficient information has been provided to demonstrate that any increase in on-street car parking would not adversely affect the local highway network nor has it been demonstrated that the proposed car park has the capacity to safely accommodate on-site car parking. Details of servicing arrangements and cycle parking have also not be provided and therefore, it has not been demonstrated adequate provision would be provided.  As such, the proposal is contrary to Policies T5, T6.2 and T7 of the London Plan (2021), CP 24, CP25 of Core Policy (2010), DMD 23, 45, 46 and DMD 47 of the Development Management Document (2014) and the NPPF (2024).",
    "Insufficient information has been provided to demonstrate the adequate, safe and functional provision is made for refuse collection. As such the proposal does not comply with Policies T2, T3, T4, T6, T6.1 and T7 of the London Plan (2021), CP22 of the Enfield Core Strategy (2010), DMD23, DMD45, DMD46, DMD47, DMD48 and DMD57of the Enfield Development Management Document (2014) and the Enfield Household Recycling and Waste Planning Guidance for New Developments (2024).  \r",
    "The proposed development, by virtue of its detailed design, namely comprising of extensive areas of solid facades with a lack of fenestration and rhythm to the proposed fenestration required to bring definition and visual interest would appear as a discordant form of development.  The proposal fails to respect the rhythm, style and proportions of the building/group of buildings of which it would form a part of. As such, the proposed development is contrary to Policies D4 of the London Plan (2021), CP30 of Core Policy (2010) DMD23, DMD 37, DMD 39 of the Development Management Document (2014) and NPPF (2024).\r\r",
    "Insufficient information has been submitted to ensure that the proposed development would incorporate a sustainable drainage system to ensure the effective management of surface water, which would reduce the risk of flooding, pollution and other environmental damage.  As such the proposal is contrary to Policies SI 14, SI 13 of the London Plan (2021), CP 21 of Core Strategy (2010), DMD 59. DMD 60, DMD 61 of the Development Management Document (2014) and NPPF (2024).\r\r",
    "In the absence of an ecology report, which includes ecological enhancements to improve the biodiversity offer on the site, it has not been demonstrated that the adjoining Wildlife Corridor would be adversely impacted by the proposal. The proposed development is therefore contrary to Policies G6 of the London Plan (2021), CP36 of Core Strategy (2010), DMD 74, DMD 79 of the Development Management Document (2014) and the NPPF (2024).",
    "Insufficient information has been provided to demonstrate the maximum achievable energy efficiency achievable for the proposed development nor has it been demonstrated that the proposed development would provide for the maximum achievable improvements in the total CO2 emissions arising from the operation of a development and its services over part L of Building Regs 2013.  As such, the proposed development is contrary to Policies CP 20 of Core Policy 20, DMD 49, DMD 51 and 53 of the Development Management Document (2014) and NPPF (2014).",
    "In the absence of a BREEAM pre-assessment report, demonstrating that the proposed development is on target to achieve an 'Excellent' rating the proposal is contrary to Policies SI 5 of the London Plan (2021), DMD 49, DMD 50 and DMD 58 of the Development Management Document (2014)."
