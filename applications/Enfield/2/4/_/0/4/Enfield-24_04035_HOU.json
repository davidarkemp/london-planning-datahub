    "The proposed extensions, by virtue of design, form, bulk, scale and siting would represent a dominant and obtrusive form of development that fails to relate to, or appear subservient to the original dwelling and would be disproportionate to the established character, form and pattern of development, detrimental to the visual amenities of the subject property and surrounding area. The proposals are thereby contrary to Policies D4 of the London Plan (2021), Core Strategy (2010) Policy CP30 and Development Management Document (2014) Policies DMD8, DMD11, DMD13, DMD14 and DMD37 and National Planning Policy Framework (2024).",
    "Insufficient information within the Flood Risk Assessment has been provided to enable assessment of whether the proposed development would result in an increase in flood risk on or off site and suitable flood control and mitigation measures have not been demonstrated, including the proximity to a culverted main river, this would be contrary to London Plan Policies SI 12 and SI 13, Policy CP28 of the Core Strategy (2010) and Policies DMD59, DMD60, DMD61 and DMD62 of the Development Management Document (2014) and National Planning Policy Framework (2024)."
