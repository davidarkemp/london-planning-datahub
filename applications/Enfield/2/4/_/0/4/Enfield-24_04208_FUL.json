    "The development hereby permitted shall begin not later than [3] years from the date of this decision.\r\rREASON: To comply with Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990, as amended by Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004. \r",
    "The development hereby permitted shall be carried out in accordance with the folowing approved plans and documents:\r\ro\tPhase 2 Site Investigation Report Grenville Cottages and Enfield Crematorium, Winnington Road\ro\tPROPOSED SITE PLAN - DFD-85-107\ro\tHIGHWAY SAFETY IMPACT FORM\ro\tGreen Belt /Metropolitan Open Land Assessment In support of 24/04208/FUL \ro\tLOCATION PLAN - DFD-85-100\ro\tLOCATION PLAN - DFD-85-101\ro\tGRAVE EXPANSION PLAN CONCEPTS - DFD-85-106\ro\tPROPOSED SITE PLAN - DFD-85-107\ro\tDesign access statement - DFD-085-102\ro\tExisting Residential Layout - DFD-085-105\ro\tEmail from the planning agent dated 11 March 2025 confirming burial rate\r\rREASON: For the avoidance of doubt and in the interests of proper planning.\r",
    "The expansion of the overflow car parking area shall not commence until details of source control SuDS has been submitted and approved by the Local Authority. The details must include plans, specifications and maintenance information. The developer should use the SuDS Proforma for minor developers to assist them through the requirements. The development shall be implemented in accordance with the approved details before the use commences. \r\rREASON: To ensure the sustainable management of water, minimise flood risk, minimise discharge of surface water outside of the curtilage of the property and ensure that the drainage system will remain functional throughout the lifetime of the development in accordance with Policy CP28 of the Core Strategy, DMD Policy 61, and Policies SI12 & SI13 of the London Plan and the NPPF and to maximise opportunities for sustainable development, improve water quality, biodiversity, local amenity and recreation value\r\r",
    "All burials in the cemetery shall be:\ro a minimum of 50 metres from a potable groundwater supply source\ro a minimum of 30 metres from a water course or spring\ro a minimum of 10 metres distance from field drains\ro a minimum of 1 metre above the highest anticipated annual groundwater level\r\rReason: To ensure that the development does not contribute to, is not put at unacceptable risk from, or adversely affected by, unacceptable levels of water pollution caused by mobilised contaminants in line with the National Planning Policy Framework.\r",
    "If, during development, contamination not previously identified is found to be present at the site then no further development (unless otherwise agreed in writing with the local planning authority) shall be carried out until the developer has submitted a remediation strategy to the local planning authority detailing how this unsuspected contamination shall be dealt with and obtained written approval from the local planning authority. The remediation strategy shall be implemented as approved.\r\rReason: No investigation can completely characterise a site. This condition ensures that the development does not contribute to, is not put at unacceptable risk from, or adversely affected by unacceptable levels of water pollution from previously unidentified contamination sources at the development site in line with the National Planning Policy Framework",
    "No drainage systems for the infiltration of surface water to the ground are permitted other than with the written consent of the local planning authority. Any proposals for such systems must be supported by an assessment of the risks to controlled waters. \rThe development shall be carried out in accordance with the approved details.\r\rReason: To ensure that the development does not contribute to, is not put at unacceptable risk from, or adversely affected by unacceptable levels of water pollution caused by mobilised contaminants in line with the National Planning Policy Framework."
