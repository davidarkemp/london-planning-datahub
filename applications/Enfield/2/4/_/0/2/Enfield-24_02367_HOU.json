    "The proposed roof extension, including rear dormer, by reason of its size, siting and design would appear bulky and incongruous, and would represent an overly dominant, incongruous and visually intrusive form of development, out of keeping and character with, and detrimental to, the appearance and character of the property and surrounding area.  This would be contrary to London Plan (2021) Policies D3, Core Strategy (2010) Policies CP30, Development Management Document (2014) Polices DMD13 and DMD37 and National Planning Policy Framework (2023)."
