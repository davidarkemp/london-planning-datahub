    "The proposed development, by reason of its design, height, mass and appearance would represent an incongruous and overly dominant appearance, which is out of keeping with the character of the host building and would disrupt the prevailing pattern of development along the streetscene. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan 2021, Core Policy 30 of the Enfield Core Strategy 2010, Policies DMD6, DMD8, DMD13, DMD37, DM38 of the Enfield Development Management Document 2014, Enfield Characterisation Study - Metroland Centres; Central Corridor, Palmers Green and the National Planning Policy Framework, 2024.",
    "The proposal would result in poor-quality living accommodation by reason of internal space, poor light and outlook to habitable rooms, sense of enclosure, poor quality amenity spaces proposed and adverse noise impacts which would be incurred by the proposed residential units, would result in a substandard and inappropriate form of accommodation for future occupiers.   The proposal is therefore considered contrary to Policies D3, D4, D5 and D6 of the London Plan (2021), Policies DMD 6 and DMD 8, DMD9 of the Development Management Document (2014), CP2, CP4, CP5 and CP30 of the Core Strategy (2010) and aims of Chapter 12 of the NPPF (2024).\r \r",
    "The proposed development, in the absence of a sunlight and daylight report, has failed to demonstrate the proposal would preserve the amenities of future occupiers of the proposal site, contrary to Section 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2024), Policies D3, D4, D5, D6, D8 of the London Plan (2021), CP4 and CP30of the Enfield Core Strategy (2010), DMD6, DMD8, DMD10 and DMD37 of the Enfield Development Management Document (2014) and the London Housing Supplementary Planning Guidance (2016).\r\r",
    "The proposal, by virtue of its size, excessive depth, height, siting, fenestration arrangement and balconies represents an overly dominant and intrusive form of development, resulting in an increased perception of overlooking and loss of privacy to the rear gardens of numbers 97-103 The Grove.  The proposal is therefore contrary to Core Policy 30 of the Enfield Core Strategy 2010 and policies DMD8, DMD10 and DMD11 of the Enfield Development Management Document 2014.\r\r",
    "Inadequate information to demonstrate that future occupiers of the proposed flats would not be unacceptably affected by noise from the existing commercial uses. In the absence of a noise report, inadequate information has been submitted to demonstrate that the proposed scheme would not result in unacceptable noise impacts and would not result in a substandard form of accommodation for future occupants of the residential units. The proposal would fail to accord with D13 and D14 of the London Plan (2021), Policy CP4 of the Core Strategy (2010) and Policies DMD8 and DMD68 of the Development Management Document (2014).",
    "The proposed development, in the absence of an adequate and coherent sustainable drainage strategy, fails to demonstrate how proposed measures manage the risk of flooding and utilise Sustainable Urban Drainage Systems (SuDS) following the drainage hierarchy in the London Plan, contrary to Section 14 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2024), Policies SI 12 and SI 13 of the London Plan (2021), CP21 and CP28 of the Enfield Core Strategy (2010), DMD59, DMD60, DMD61, DMD62 of the Enfield Development Management Document (2014) and the Enfield Strategic Flood Risk Assessment (2021).",
    "The proposed waste storage, by virtue of its means of access, location and layout as submitted, would fail to provide a convenient and accessible facility for managing waste generated by the development, contrary to Section 9 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2024), Policies T2, T3, T4, T6, T6.1 and T7 of the London Plan (2021), CP22 of the Enfield Core Strategy (2010), DMD47, DMD48 and DMD57of the Enfield Development Management Document (2014) and the Enfield Household Recycling and Waste Planning Guidance for New Developments (2024)."
