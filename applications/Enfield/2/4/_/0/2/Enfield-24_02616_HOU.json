    "The development to which this permission relates must be begun not later than the expiration of three years beginning with the date of the decision notice. \rReason: To comply with the provisions of S.51 of the Planning & Compulsory Purchase Act 2004.\r",
    "Notwithstanding the provisions of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 2015, or any amending Order, no balustrades or other means of enclosure shall be erected on the roof of the extension(s). No roof of any part of the extension(s) shall be used for any recreational purpose and access shall only be for the purposes of the maintenance of the property or means of emergency escape. \rReason: To safeguard the privacy of the occupiers of adjoining properties.\r",
    "The external finishing materials shall match those used in the construction of the existing building and/or areas of hard surfacing. \rReason: To ensure a satisfactory appearance.\r",
    "The development hereby permitted shall be carried out in accordance with the approved plans, \r\rLocation Plan\rBlock Plan\rL01\rL02 Rev A\rL03 Rev B\rL04 Rev C \rFlood Risk Assessment\r\rReason: For the avoidance of doubt and in the interests of proper planning.\r",
    "The extension hereby permitted shall not be occupied at any time other than for purposes ancillary to the residential use of the dwelling known as 20 Picketts Lock Lane N9 0AY. \r\rReason: To ensure that the development does not detract from the amenity of the adjoining properties, and to enable the Local Planning Authority to retain control over the use of the building.\r",
    "Prior to above ground works details of source control SuDS has been submitted and approved by the Local Authority. Source control SuDS measures include green roofs, rain gardens and permeable paving. The details must include plans, specifications and maintenance information. The developer should use the SuDS Proforma for minor developers found here to assist them through our requirements.  The Flood Risk assessment also mentions the use of a soakaway.  Runoff being directly discharged into a soakaway will not be acceptable unless source control SuDS measures have been utilised upstream.\r\rReason: To ensure the sustainable management of water, minimise flood risk, minimise discharge of surface water outside of the curtilage of the property and ensure that the drainage system will remain functional throughout the lifetime of the development in accordance with Policy CP28 of the Core Strategy, DMD Policy 61, and Policies SI12 & SI13 of the London Plan and the NPPF and to maximise opportunities for sustainable development, improve water quality, biodiversity, local amenity and recreation value.\r\r"
