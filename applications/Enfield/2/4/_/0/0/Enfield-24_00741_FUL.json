    "The proposals by virtue of the loss of green and verdant character and various paraphernalia associated with the development would represent an urbanising appearance and thereby fails to preserve or enhance the character and appearance of the Highlands Conservation Area with the identified less than substantial harm not being outweighed by public benefits. As such the scheme is contrary to Section 72(1) of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990, Section 16 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2023; Policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021; DMD44 of the Enfield Development Management Document 2014; and Policy 31 of the Enfield Core Strategy 2010-25 and the aims and intensions outlined within the Highlands Conservation Area Character Appraisal and Management Proposals (2015).\r\r\r\r\r",
    "Insufficient arboricultural evidence has been provided, in the form of BS 5837:2012, to demonstrate that there would be no undue harm caused to trees in the Conservation Area by the proposed development. The trees are prominent and offer high valuable amenity within the Meadway Conservation Area and the irrevocable damage to these trees caused by the development is unjustifiable and would not be acceptable. The proposal would therefore be contrary to the advice contained within the NPPF, NPPG, London Plan policies G7, Core Strategy policy CP31 and DMD80 of the Development Management Document (2014).",
    "The proposal has failed to demonstrate measures to promote and manage sustainable drainage across the site which inhibits the ability of the Local Planning Authority to fully assess whether the proposed development would result in an increase in flood risk on or off the site.  The proposals are thereby contrary to the advice contained within the NPPF (2021), Policies CP21 of the Core Strategy (2010), SI13 of the London Plan (2021) and DMD 61 of the Development Management Document (2014).  \r\r",
    "The proposed development, by reason of the increase in traffic and parking demand likely to be generated from the provision of the charging points, would give rise to vehicles potentially waiting for charging as well as reversing from, or onto the charging location, to the detriment of highway safety and free flow of traffic, including pedestrians and public transport, thus the proposal would be contrary to the Council's Technical Footway Guidance 2013, Policies T5, T6 and T7 of the London Plan,  DMD46 and DMD47 of the Development Management Document (2014), and  CP24, CP25 and CP30 of the Core Strategy, as well as the advice contained within the NPPF.\r\r\r\r"
