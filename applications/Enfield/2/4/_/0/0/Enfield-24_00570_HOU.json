    "The proposed crossover will result in the intensity of vehicle movements, vehicles reversing from or into the Classified Road\rleading to vehicles stopping, slowing and turning from or onto Bury Street prejudicial to the free flow of traffic on the classified road and to the detriment of road safety, including pedestrians and public transport, as well as resulting in a loss of on-street car parking in an\rarea of high demand. Therefore, the proposal would be contrary to, London Plan Policies LP Policies T1, T2 and T6, Core Strategy (2010)\rPolicies CP24 and CP30, Policy DMD 46 of the Development Management Document (2014), the Council's Technical Footway\rGuidance (2013) as well as the aims of the NPPF (2024) which seeks to create places that are safe and minimise the scope for conflicts\rbetween pedestrians, cyclists and vehicles."
