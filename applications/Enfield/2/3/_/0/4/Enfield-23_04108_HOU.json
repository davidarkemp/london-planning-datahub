    "The proposed first floor rear extension by reason of its bulk, width, mass, scale and when viewed in conjunction with the existing large rear dormer would appear visually intrusive, incongruous, overly dominant and out of keeping with the character and appearance of the host building and the surrounding area of which it forms part. The proposal is therefore contrary to Section 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies D4 of the London Plan (2021), CP30 of the Enfield Core Strategy (2010), DMD6, DMD8, DMD11 and DMD37 of the Enfield Development Management Document (2014).",
    "The proposed development would fail to meet the minimum width required for single bedroom, and by virtue of its shortfall in width, bedroom 3 would give rise to a substandard form of accommodation detrimental to the living conditions of existing and future occupiers. This is contrary to section 12 of the National Planning Policy (2023), Policies D6 of the London Plan (2021), CP30 of the Enfield Core Strategy (2010), and DMD5 , DMD6 and DMD8 of the Enfield Development Management Document (2014) and requirements of the London Plan Housing Supplementary Planning Guidance (2016).",
    "The proposed first floor rear extension, by virtue of its width, depth, form and proximity to the site boundary, would result in an overly dominant form of development which would give rise to an unneighbourly loss of sunlight, daylight and outlook, for the occupiers of the neighbouring properties at Nos. 33 & 37 Forest Road and result in a heightened sense of enclosure. The proposal is therefore contrary to Section 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023), Policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021), CP4 and CP30 of the Enfield Core Strategy (2010), DMD6, DMD8, DMD11 and DMD37 of the Enfield Development Management Document (2014)"
