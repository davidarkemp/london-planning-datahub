    "Given the modest amount of regrowth the tree has produced since it was last pruned, re-reduction is not currently judged to be necessary. In addition, regular crown reduction is promoting the development of a 'structural pollard'-type appearance, which is undesirable in aesthetic / amenity terms. Notwithstanding this, should a further application be made, the Council may be minded to agree lesser works improve daylight to the neighbouring dwellings to the north, such as crown thinning / removal of crown epicormic shoots."
