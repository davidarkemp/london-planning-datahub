    "Notwithstanding the details set out in the submitted Drainage Drawing (E_LH_199_014_SUDS/DRAINAGE), 6th October 2023, prior to the commencement of any construction work, details of the Sustainable Drainage Strategy shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority. The details shall include:\r\ro\tResults of infiltration testing to determine the applicability of full and partial infiltration. If infiltration is not deemed acceptable through infiltration testing an appropriate attenuation feature must be provided in line with the London Plan Drainage Hierarchy \r\ro\tFinal sizes, storage volumes, invert levels, cross-sections and specifications of all SuDS measures including rain gardens, permeable paving, and soakaways \r\ro\tManagement Plan for future maintenance\r\rReason: To ensure the sustainable management of water, minimise flood risk, minimise discharge of surface water outside of the curtilage of the property and ensure that the drainage system will remain functional throughout the lifetime of the development in accordance with Policy CP28 of the Enfield Core Strategy (2010), Policy DMD61 Enfield Development Management Document (2014), Policies SI12 & SI13 of the London Plan (2021) and the NPPF and to maximise opportunities for sustainable development, improve water quality, biodiversity, local amenity and recreation value.\r",

    "All Non-Road Mobile Machinery (NRMM) of net power of 37kW and up to and including 560kW used during the course of the demolition, site preparation and construction phases shall comply with the emission standards set out in chapter 7 of the GLA's supplementary planning guidance \"Control of Dust and Emissions During Construction and Demolition\" dated July 2014 (SPG), or subsequent guidance. Unless it complies with the standards set out in the SPG, no NRMM shall be on site, at any time, whether in use or not, without the prior written consent of the local planning authority.
