  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed part single, part 2-storey rear extension, together with roof additions by reason of their size, siting design and roof arrangement would appear bulky and incongruous, and would represent an overly dominant, incongruous, and visually intrusive form of development, unbalancing the appearance of the pairs of semi-detached dwellings out of keeping and character with, and detrimental to, the appearance and character of the property and surrounding area.  This would be contrary to Core Strategy (2010) Policies CP30, Development Management Document (2014) Polices DMD11, DMD13, DMD14 and DMD37, London Plan (2021) Policy D4 and National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The proposed rear extensions by reason of their siting, depth and height would have an overbearing effect upon the adjoining property No.150 South Lodge Drive, through loss of light and outlook detrimental to the amenities of the adjoining neighbouring occupier contrary to Core Strategy CP30 and Development Management Document Policies DMD8, DMD11 and DMD37.",
    "Insufficient information has been provided within the Basement impact assessment (BIA) to fully consider the impacts of the development and as such the development fails to accord with Policies D10, SI.12 and SI.13 of the London Plan (2021), DMD 59, DMD 60, DMD 61 and DMD 62 of the Development Management Document (2014), CP21, CP28 and CP29 of the Core Strategy (2010).",
    "In the absence of a Sustainable Drainage Strategy and an acceptable Groundwater Flood Risk Assessment report, the proposed scheme fails to appropriately consider and mitigate the risk of flooding from all potential sources, for a more sensitive residential use with habitable rooms in a basement. Therefore, it is considered the scheme would be unsafe over its lifetime, taking into account the impact of climate change. In view of this, the proposal is not compliant with the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF, 2021), policies SI.12 and SI.13 of the London Plan (2021), DMD 60, DMD 61, DMD 62 and DMD 63 of the Development Management Document (2014), CP21, CP28 and CP29 of the Core Strategy (2010)."
