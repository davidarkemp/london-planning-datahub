    "The proposed development, by reason of depth of the proposed rear extension would be overbearing and result in loss of privacy, inadequate outlook, poor level of light and with a lack of defensible space to the occupiers of the adjacent flat 1 and would lead to the creation of a substandard form of accommodation that is detrimental to the living conditions of future occupiers of the new unit and the ground floor flat, contrary to Policy D6 of The London Plan (2021), Policy CP4 of the Core Strategy (2010), Policies DMD5 and DMD8 of the Development Management Document (2014) and requirements of the London Plan Housing Supplementary Planning Guidance and the guidance contained within the National Planning Policy Framework, 2024.",
    "The proposed development and creation of a new unit, by virtue of the limited dimensions of the plot and siting in close proximity to the common boundary with Flat 1 and depth to the rear boundary would result in a cramped form of development, which fails to relate to the surrounding spacious form and pattern of development and thereby represents a general  overdevelopment of the site that is out of keeping and character with the  surrounding form and pattern of development and harmful to the visual  amenity of the locality. The proposals are thereby contrary to Policies CP30 of  the Core Strategy, D3 and D4 of the London Plan, DMD6, DMD7 and DMD8, \rand DMD37 of the Development Management Document, as well as the guidance contained within the NPPF.\r",
    "The proposed development, by reason of its poor outlook, lack of privacy and defensible space, lack of private amenity space and poor quality of communal amenity space would result in a substandard and inappropriate form of accommodation which would be detrimental to the future occupants. The proposal is thereby contrary to Policy D6 of the London Plan, Policy CP4 of the Enfield Plan Core Strategy, Policy DMD7 and DMD8 of the Development Management Document, the Mayor of London Housing Supplementary Planning Guidance, the advice contained within the National Planning Policy Framework, which together seek to achieve good quality accommodation.\r"
