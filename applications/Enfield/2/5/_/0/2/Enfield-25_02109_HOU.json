    "The proposed crossover will result in the intensity of vehicle movements, vehicles reversing from or into the Classified Road leading to vehicles stopping, slowing and turning from or onto Chase Road prejudicial to the free flow of traffic on the classified road and to the detriment of road safety, including pedestrians and public transport, as well as resulting in a loss of on-street car parking in an area of high demand. In these respects, the proposal would be contrary to the Council's Technical Footway Guidance (2013), Policy DMD 46 of the Development Management Document (2014), and the Core Strategy (2010) Policies CP24 and CP30, as well as the aims of the NPPF (2024)."
