    "This consent is valid for two years.\rReason: In order that the nature of work pertaining to this consent remains appropriate.\r\r\r",
    "Before the works hereby permitted commence on site, full details and a specification for a proposal to provide two pine trees to replace those to be removed by virtue of this consent, shall be submitted to the Local Planning Authority. The replacement trees shall be planted in the rear garden, but do not have to be in identical locations to the existing trees. The specification shall include, but not be limited to, the following: Confirmation of the location of the proposed replacement trees; the species of trees and the size (which shall be not less than 10-12cm 'Selected Standard' size), the planting methodology, support systems and an aftercare plan.\rThe replacement tree shall be supplied and planted in accordance with BS 3936-1: 1992 Nursery Stock - Specification for trees and shrubs (or an equivalent British Standard if replaced), BS 8545: 2014 Trees from nursery to independence in the landscape - Recommendations, and the National Plant Specification. \rThe proposals must be undertaken at the site in the first planting season [November to March] or part thereof following the commencement of works on site. The Local Planning Authority must be informed in writing once the replacement trees have been planted.\rReason: In the interests of visual amenity and in order to maintain tree population at this site after the removal of the preserved trees and in accordance with the requirements of Section 206 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990.\r\r",
    "If within a period of five years from the date of planting, the replacement trees, (or if within a period of five years from the date of planting any trees planted in replacement for them), are removed, uprooted, destroyed or die, or become in the opinion of the local planning authority, seriously damaged or defective, trees of the same species and size as that originally planted shall be planted in the same place, unless the local planning authority gives its written approval to any variation.\rReason: In the interests of visual amenity and in order to maintain tree population at this site after the removal of the preserved trees and in accordance with the requirements of Section 206 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990.\r",
    "Tree work should not be carried out during periods that are likely to interfere with or disturb breeding birds or mammals.\rReason: In order to comply with the requirements of the Wildlife and Countryside Act (1981) and Conservation of Habitats and Species Regulations (2010).\r"
