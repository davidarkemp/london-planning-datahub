    "The proposed rear dormer, by virtue of its size, lack of insets and location in the roof plane of the subject building, would appear excessively large, dominant and out of character in relation to the host property and the terrace it forms a part of. The development would therefore be contrary to Policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021), CP 30 of the Enfield Core Strategy (2010) and DMD 13 and DMD 37 of the Enfield Development Management Document (2014)."
