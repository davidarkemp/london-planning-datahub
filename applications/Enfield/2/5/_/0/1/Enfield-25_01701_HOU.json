    "The proposed vehicular access would lead to vehicles stopping, slowing and turning onto or from a section of highway. A crossover at this site would increase the intensity of vehicle movements onto the classified highway to the detriment of safety and free flow of traffic and will result in vehicles reversing from or onto Nightingale Road, to the detriment of highway safety and free flow of traffic, including pedestrians, as well the loss of available on street car parking at a site where alternative off street car parking is available at the rear. In these respects, the proposal would be contrary to the Council's Technical Footway Guidance (2013), Policy DMD 46 of the Development Management Document (2014), and the Core Strategy (2010) Policies CP24 and CP30, as well as the aims of the NPPF (2024)."
