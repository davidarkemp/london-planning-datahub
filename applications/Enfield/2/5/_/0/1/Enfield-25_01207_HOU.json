    "The proposed development, by virtue of its bulk and excessive depth, sited on the boundary with the adjoining neighbour, would be an overbearing and unneighbourly form of development that would give rise to loss of light to the rear bay window at 59 Woodland Way, to an extent that would harm the amenity of the adjoining neighbour. Therefore, the proposal is contrary to policy D3 of the London Plan (2021), to policy CP30 of the Core Strategy (2010), to policies DMD8, DMD11 and DMD37 of the Development Management Document, and to Section 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2024)."
