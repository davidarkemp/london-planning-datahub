    "The development to which this permission relates must be begun not later than the expiration of three years beginning with the date of the decision notice. \rReason: To comply with the provisions of S.51 of the Planning & Compulsory Purchase Act 2004.\r",
    "The development hereby approved shall be carried out in accordance with the following approved plans with the approved plans which forms part of this notice. \r \rLocation Plan; Highway Impact Assessment; P01; P02; P03; P04; P05; P06; P07.\r\r\rReason: For the avoidance of doubt and in the interests of proper planning. \r \r",
    "No independent cooking or laundry facilities shall be installed in any of the respective bedrooms, and the communal kitchens and dining room shall be retained as such in perpetuity.\r\rReason: To accord with the stipulations of definition as a House of Multiple Occupation and to safeguard the residential character of the surrounding area.\r \r",
    "Prior to occupation, unless otherwise agreed, cycle parking should be provided in compliance with the following criteria:\r\r-\tProvision of a minimum of SIX long stay cycle parking spaces, one per HMO bedroom.\r-\tIn an accessible location. The access route to the cycle parking enclosures should be a minimum of 1.2 metres wide to enable the bike to enter the store. It should be step free and involve no more than two doors or gates, excluding the store door, which must also have a minimum opening width of 1.2 metres.\r-\tLong stay must be secured with a British Standard mortice lock or access fob.\r-\tLong stay must be fully enclosed with four walls and a roof.\r\rReason: The Council's Climate Action and Transport Policies seek to increase the use of active and sustainable transport modes. This means that access to bicycle parking should be easy and secure to remove potential barriers to cycling.\r",
    "The refuse and recycling storage hereby approved shall be carried out in accordance with the approved details and thereafter maintained unless otherwise in writing by the Local Planning Authority.\r\rReason: In the interests of amenity and the recycling of waste materials in support of the Boroughs waste reduction targets. \r",
    "The use of the property as a House in Multiple Occupation hereby approved shall be occupied by a maximum of 6 people at any one time and shall not be subdivided or occupied as self-contained units.  \r\rReason: To accord with the stipulations of definition as a House of Multiple Occupation and to safeguard the residential character of the surrounding area. \r",
    "All new external work shall be carried out in materials that resemble, as closely as possible, in colour and texture those specified in the approved application. \r \rReason: To safeguard the appearance of the premises and the character of the immediate area. \r",
    "The development shall commence until details of source control SuDS has been submitted and approved by the Local Authority. Source control SuDS measures include green roofs, rain gardens and permeable paving. The details must include plans, specifications and maintenance information. The developer should use the SuDS Proforma for minor developers found on our webpage https://www.enfield.gov.uk/services/planning/sustainable-drainage-systems to assist them through our requirements.\r\rREASON: To ensure the sustainable management of water, minimise flood risk, minimise discharge of surface water outside of the curtilage of the property and ensure that the drainage system will remain functional throughout the lifetime of the development in accordance with Policy CP28 of the Core Strategy, DMD Policy 61, and Policies SI12 & SI13 of the London Plan and the NPPF and to maximise opportunities for sustainable development, improve water quality, biodiversity, local amenity and recreation value.\r",
    "The windows to the en-suite bathroom to rooms 4 and 5 as indicated on approved drawings 'P01' and 'P02' shall be in obscured glass with an equivalent obscuration as level 3 on the Pilkington Obscuration Range. The glazing shall not be altered without the approval in writing of the Local Planning Authority. \r\rReason: To safeguard the privacy of the occupiers of adjoining and neighbouring properties. \r"
