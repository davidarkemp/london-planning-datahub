    "The proposed part single, part 2-storey side/rear extension, by reason of its excessive depth, scale, design, and prominent siting, would appear overly dominant, visually intrusive and would fail to preserve or enhance the character and appearance of the Conservation Area contrary to Section and 72(1) of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990. The harm caused is not outweighed by public benefits and therefore fails to accord with Section 16 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2024; Policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021; Policy 44 of the DMD 2014; Policy 31 of the Core Strategy 2010.",
    "The proposed first floor rear extension, by reason of its excessive depth and scale would result in an overly dominant form of development which would result in an unacceptable loss of outlook, loss of sunlight, overshadowing and a heightened sense of enclosure, which would be detrimental to the residential and visual amenities of the neighbouring occupiers at 25 Essex Road. The proposed first floor rear extension is therefore contrary to Policy CP 4 & CP 30 of the Enfield Core Strategy 2010 and DMD 8, DMD 11 & DMD 14 of the Enfield Development Management Document 2014."
