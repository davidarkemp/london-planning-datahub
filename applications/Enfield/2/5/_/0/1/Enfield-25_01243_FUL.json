    "All areas of trees, hedges, scrub or similar vegetation where birds may nest which are to be removed as part of the development, are to be cleared outside the bird-nesting season (March to August inclusive) or if clearance during the bird-nesting season cannot reasonably be avoided, a suitably qualified ecologist will check the areas to be removed immediately prior to clearance and advise whether nesting birds are present.  If active nests are recorded, no vegetation clearance or other works that may disturb active nests shall proceed until all young have fledged the nest. \r\rReason: To ensure that wildlife is not adversely impacted by the proposed development in accordance with national wildlife legislation and in line with CP36 of the Core Strategy. Nesting birds are protected under the Wildlife and Countryside Act, 1981 (as amended)."
