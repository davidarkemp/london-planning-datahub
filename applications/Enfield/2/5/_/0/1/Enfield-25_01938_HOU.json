    "The proposed extensions, by virtue of design, form, bulk, scale and siting would represent a dominant and obtrusive form of development that fails to relate to, or appear subservient to the original dwelling and would be disproportionate to the established character, form and pattern of development, detrimental to the visual amenities of the subject property and surrounding area. The proposals are thereby contrary to Policies D4 of the London Plan (2021), Core Strategy (2010) Policy CP30 and Development Management Document (2014) Policies DMD8,  DMD13 and DMD37 and National Planning Policy Framework (2024).\r\r",
    "The proposed balcony by reason of its siting, size and relationship with neighbouring properties, would be at an elevated vantage point offering direct unobstructed panoramic views towards the adjoining rear gardens of adjoining properties. This would cause an unacceptable level of actual and perceived overlooking and undue loss of privacy to private amenity space.  As such, it constitutes an unneighbourly form of development and the proposal is contrary to Policy D4 of the London Plan (2021), DMD 8 of the Development Management Document (2014) and Policy CP30 of the Core Strategy (2010), National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF, 2024)."
