    "The proposal, in the absence of agreement regarding viability assessment, in the absence of an agreed S106 legal agreement, and due to the proposition of an unacceptable and deficient financial offer in lieu of affordable housing, would result in an unacceptable loss of affordable housing which would fail to satisfy identified need for affordable housing to the detriment of delivering mixed and inclusive communities. Given this, the proposal is contrary to the NPPF (2024), including to Section 5, to policies H4 and H5 of the London Plan (2021), to policy DMD1 of the Development Management Document (2014), to policy CP3 of the Core Strategy (2010), and to The Mayor of London's 'Affordable Housing and Supplementary Planning Guidance' (2017)."
