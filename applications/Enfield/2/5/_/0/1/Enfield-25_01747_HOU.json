    "The proposed first floor side extension, by reason of its siting along the side common boundary, would contribute to the creation of a terracing effect which would be out of keeping with the character of the immediate area, where semi-detached properties predominate and broadly uniform spacing is maintained between properties. The proposal is therefore contrary to Section 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2024), Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021), policy CP30 of the Enfield Core Strategy (2010) and policies DMD14 and DMD37 of the Enfield Development Management Document (2014)."
