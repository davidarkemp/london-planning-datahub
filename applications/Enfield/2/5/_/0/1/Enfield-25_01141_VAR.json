As such, the proposal is considered to be contrary to Policies D3 Optimising Site Capacity Through the Design-Led Approach of the London Plan 2021, Core Policy 32 Pollution of the Core Strategy 2010, DMD 8 General Standards for New Residential Development and DMD 68 Noise of the Development Management Document 2014 and the NPPF 2024."
