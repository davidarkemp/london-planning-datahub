    "The proposed crossover and its proximity to the junction will result in an intensity of vehicle movements leading to vehicles stopping, slowing and turning from, or onto Newmans Way thus adversely affecting highway safety and prejudicial to the free and safe flow of traffic, including pedestrians and cyclists. Furthermore, the loss of existing street tree and grass verge/vegetation would have a negative aesthetic impact on the character of the street scene causing visual harm, where alternative access does appear to be available  In these respects the proposal would therefore be contrary to Core Strategy Policies CP24, CP25 and CP30 and Development Management Document Policies DMD37 and DMD45, DMD46 as well as the Council's Technical Footway Guidance 2013, and the aims of the NPPF."
