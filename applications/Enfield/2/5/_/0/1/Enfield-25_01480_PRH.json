    "The eave height of the proposed building would measure 3.2m and be within 2m of the boundary of the curtilage of the dwellinghouse. Thus, the proposal would not comply with the criteria of Paragraph A.1 (i) of Class A, Part 1, Schedule 2 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "The single-storey rear extension by reason of its depth, height and sitting would constitute an obtrusive and overly dominant form of development, that would result in an unacceptable loss of light, outlook, and a heightened sense of enclosure detrimental to the occupiers of the adjoining properties at Nos. 15 Collinwood Avenue. In this respect the proposal would be contrary to Policy CP30 of the Enfield Core Strategy (2010), Policy DMD11 of the Enfield Development Management Document (2014)."
