    "The proposed crossover will result in the intensity of vehicle movements, vehicles reversing from or into the Classified Road leading to vehicles stopping, slowing and turning from or onto Victoria Road prejudicial to the free flow of traffic on the classified road and the loss of on street car parking to the detriment of road safety, including pedestrians and cyclists. Therefore, the proposal would be contrary to, London Plan (2021) Policies LP Policies T1, T2 and T6, Core Strategy (2010) Policies CP24 and CP30, Development Management Document (2014) Policy DMD46, the Council's Technical Footway Guidance (2013) as well as the aims of the NPPF (2024) which seeks to create places that are safe and minimise the scope for conflicts between pedestrians, cyclists and vehicles.",
    "The proposed vehicular crossover does not demonstrate sufficient separation from the existing street tree and would therefore compromise the heath of the street tree and the subsequent long-term survival of the tree, which would significantly undermine the visual amenity of the surrounding area. The proposal also does not sufficiently demonstrate that the tree would not cause obstruction issues thus compromising the visibility of entering and exiting the site safely.  The proposal would be contrary to Policies D4 of the London Plan (2021), Core Strategy (2010) Policy CP30, Development Management Document (2014) Policies DMD46 and DMD80 and National Planning Policy Framework (2024)."
