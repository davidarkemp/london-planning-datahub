    "Insufficient information has been provided to demonstrate compliance with the stated condition 4 (Sustainable drainage system); pursuant to planning application ref: 22/00574/FUL Single Storey Side Extension dated 15.12.2022. As applications for details reserved by conditions cannot be part discharged, condition 8 (Tree planting scheme) and condition 18 (tree protection) is also not discharged. \r\r\rThe proposal would fail to ensure the sustainable management of water, minimise flood risk, minimise discharge of surface water outside of the curtilage of the property and ensure that the drainage system will remain functional throughout the lifetime of the development in accordance with Policy CP28 of the Core Strategy, DMD Policy 61, and Policies SI12 & SI13 of the London Plan (2021) and the NPPF (2021) and fails to maximise opportunities for sustainable development, improve water quality, biodiversity, local amenity and recreation value.\r"
