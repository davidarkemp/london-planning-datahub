    "By reason of its height, bulk, massing, and materials, the development appears visually prominent, overbearing, and out of keeping with the established rhythm, scale, and character of the surrounding street scene. It fails to integrate with the host property or respect the local context, resulting in harm to the character and appearance of the area. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies DMD6, DMD8, DMD37, and DMD38 of the Enfield Development Management Document, Policies D3, D4, and D8 of the London Plan, and the National Planning Policy Framework (2024).",
    "The proposed rear extensions, by reason of their siting, depth, and height, would result in an overbearing and visually intrusive form of development that causes an undue sense of enclosure and loss of outlook to the adjoining property at No. 71 Barrowell Green, to the detriment of the residential amenities of that occupier. The proposal is therefore contrary to Core Strategy Policy CP30 and Policies DMD8, DMD11, and DMD37 of the Enfield Development Management Document.",
    "The proposal fails to demonstrate, through a satisfactory site-specific Flood Risk Assessment and groundwater assessment, that the development - including a basement-level habitable room in an area at risk of surface water flooding - would be safe for its lifetime without increasing flood risk elsewhere. In the absence of evidence regarding finished floor levels, flood storage compensation, safe access and egress, and the impact on groundwater flows, the development is contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2024), London Plan Policies SI12 and SI13, and Enfield Development Management Document Policies DMD59, DMD61, and DMD62.",
    "The layout and standard of accommodation for Flats 2 and 4 fail to meet the minimum gross internal floor area requirements set out in the Technical Housing Standards - Nationally Described Space Standards, resulting in substandard living conditions and contributing to a cramped and overdeveloped form of development. In addition, the lack of adequate fenestration, particularly at basement level, results in poor outlook, insufficient daylight and inadequate ventilation, to the detriment of residential amenity. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies DMD6, DMD8 and DMD9 of the Enfield Development Management Document, Policies of the London Plan, the National Planning Policy Framework (2024), and the Technical Housing Standards - Nationally Described Space Standards."
