    "A Flood Risk Assessment (FRA) has not been submitted to demonstrate that the proposal is safe from flooding and will not increase flood risk elsewhere this is contrary to the requirements set out in the NPPF (2021) and the adopted Development Plans. Therefore, the Local Planning Authority has not been provided with a suitable basis for assessment to be made of the flood risks arising from the proposed development. Additionally, the proposal has failed to demonstrate measures to promote and manage sustainable drainage across the site which inhibits the ability of the Local Planning Authority to fully assess whether the proposed development would result in an increase in flood risk on or off the site.  The proposals are thereby contrary to the advice contained within the NPPF (2024), Policies CP1 and CP28 of the Core Strategy (2010), SI12 and SI13 of the London Plan (2021) and DMD 59, 60, 61 and 62 of the Development Management Document (2014)."
