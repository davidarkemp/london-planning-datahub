Yet, the application form has \"No\" selected, when asked if the reasons for carrying out the proposed works are due to the condition of the tree. By the selection of \"No\" to this question, the requirement to submit substantiating evidence has been evaded, and in the absence of this to demonstrate the necessity of the proposals, and the negative impact on the tree's health and amenity value, the stated reasons for the work are considered unjustified."
