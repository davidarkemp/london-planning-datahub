    "The proposed development, by virtue of its height, excessive depth and siting on the common boundaries, would result in an overly dominant form of development which would give rise to an unneighbourly loss of sunlight and daylight, would result in a loss of outlook, and would result in a heightened sense of enclosure as perceived from neighbouring properties at Nos. 61 & 65 Swan Way. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy CP30 of the Enfield Core Strategy (2010) and Policies DMD11 and DMD37 of the Enfield Development Management Document (2014)."
