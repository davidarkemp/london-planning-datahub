    "The proposed development, by reason of its design, height, excessive width, large crown roof, scale and size, would represent an incongruous addition and significant overdevelopment of the host building detracting from its character and appearance, whilst also impacting negatively on the character and appearance of the surrounding area including street scene of The Close given the exposed corner nature of the plot. The proposal would be contrary to the NPPF (2024), D4 and D5 of the London Plan (2021), DMD8, DMD 13 and DMD 37 of the Development Management Plan (2014) and CP30 of the Core Strategy (2010).\r"
