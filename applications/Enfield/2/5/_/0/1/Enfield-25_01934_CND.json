    "The proposal in relation to Condition 10 (hard and soft landscaping and means of enclosure) would fail to achieve a means of enclosure together with high quality of landscaping which contributes to the visual amenity and character of the area. The submitted information is not consistent in relation to the means of enclosure and how this will achieve a built structure whilst not damaging  the tree T17.  The supplied \"Method Statement: Installation of Landscaping and Enclosures with Tree Protection Measures\" Paragraph 4 b , describes installation of fence posts whereas the plans show installation of brick piers and a low brick wall with railings above. The wall and the piers go directly through the RPA of T17. No information has been given as to the construction of the wall and pier system using lintels, and how this will achieve a viable built structure whilst not damaging the tree T17. Clarity is required on the from of enclosure and how this will be installed including across the RPA of T17.  Lastly, the protection area for the planting beds near T17 has not been clearly specified, digging up to 300mm in the RPA for landscape works is not acceptable, it has not been demonstrated that the rooting depth of the tree will not be disturbed.  This fails to ensure that the development achieves a means of enclosure which is compatible with high quality of landscaping required to contribute to the visual amenity and character of the area. The application in relation to condition 10 is therefore not in accordance with Core Policy 30 and Development Management Document Policy DMD80."
