    "The proposed single storey infill side and rear extension by reason of its overall depth, siting, design, height and scale would result in an excessive depth of development close to the mutual boundary with the adjoining neighbouring property at no. 18 Winchester Road, disproportionate to the character of the property and out of keeping with the surrounding form and pattern of development within the terrace of which the site forms a part. Furthermore, the proposed side and rear extension by virtue of its excessive depth, design, siting and scale would give rise to an unacceptable loss of residential amenity to the occupiers of the attached neighbouring property, contrary to policies CP30 of the Core Strategy, DMD8, DMD11 and DMD37 of the DMD, D3 of the London Plan (2021) and the NPPF (2024).",
    "The proposed rear and outrigger dormers by virtue of their design, scale, siting and dimensions would give rise to a contrived and bulky form of development that would be detrimental to the visual amenities of Winchester Road.  Additionally, the dormers would create additional bulk to the roofscape to represent a dominant and incongruous addition and awkward relationship with the parent roofslope, thereby both unbalancing and detracting from the character and symmetry of the prevailing build form within the terrace of which the site forms a part, resulting in an overdevelopment at the application site. The proposal would therefore fail to preserve and enhance the character and appearance of the application dwelling, contrary to Policies D3 of the London Plan (2021), CP30 of the Core Strategy, DMD13 and DMD37 of the Development Management Document as well as the aims and intentions outlined within the NPPF (2024).",
    "The proposal by reason of its inadequate head heights within the proposed dormers as well as limited communal kitchen/dining space at ground floor, would represent a sub-standard and inappropriate form of accommodation which would not be capable of meeting the reasonable needs of occupiers and would be detrimental to the residential amenities of future occupants. The proposal is thereby contrary to Policy D6 of the London Plan, Policy CP4 of the Enfield Plan Core Strategy, Policies DMD5 and DMD8 of the Development Management Document, the Mayor of London Housing Supplementary Planning Guidance, The Technical Housing Standards-Nationally Described Space Standards and the guidance contained within the National Planning Policy Framework (2024).",
    "Insufficient information has been submitted relating to refuse provision and storage arrangements to demonstrate that the proposed HMO would not result in significant harm to the character and appearance of the application site as well as the visual amenities of the street scene, contrary to Policies D3 of the London Plan (2021), Policy CP30 of the Core Strategy, policies DMD5, DMD8, DMD37 and DMD47 of the Development Management Document."
