    "This consent is valid for two years.\rReason: In order that the nature of work pertaining to this consent remains appropriate. \r",
    "The works hereby approved shall only be carried out strictly in accordance with British Standard 3998 [2010] 'Tree Works'.\rReason: In the interests of the health, safety and appearance of the preserved tree.\r",
    "Tree work should not be carried out during periods that are likely to interfere with or disturb breeding birds or mammals.\rReason: In order to comply with the requirements of the Wildlife and Countryside Act (1981) and Conservation of Habitats and Species Regulations (2010).\r",
    "The proposed works would have a significantly negative impact upon the tree's long-term health, and the tree's amenity value. The result would be an unacceptable volume of the tree being removed because the lamp column is approx. 5m from the trunk of the tree, meaning that up to 50% of the tree would be removed to achieve the proposal. This would mean inflicting large wounds on the tree, removing a significant amount of energy storing and leaf bearing structure, and significantly reducing the tree's amenity value. It is not at all necessary to inflict this level of damage on the tree. The lamp column is largely uninhibited, and the lamp itself is downward facing and largely unobstructed. Minor and sympathetic pruning of some branch tips around the lamp itself could improve the light spread from the lamp, and the council would consider this, should a further application be made."
