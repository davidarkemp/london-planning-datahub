    "The proposed front boundary wall, railings and gates, by reason of their excessive height, design, materials proposed, and removal/ enclosure of existing soft landscaping, would result in an overly dominant and visually intrusive form of development which would unacceptably enclose number 10 Beech Hill and would be out of keeping with the open, semi-rural character of the immediate context. The development is therefore contrary to policy D4 London Plan (2021), policy CP30 of the Enfield Core Strategy (2010), policies DMD6, DMD8 and DMD 37 of the Enfield Development Management Document (2014) and Policy HW-2 of the Hadley Wood Neighbourhood Plan 2023."
