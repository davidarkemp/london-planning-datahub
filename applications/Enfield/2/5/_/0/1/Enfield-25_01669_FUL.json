    "The development to which this permission relates must be begun not later than the expiration of three years beginning with the date of the decision notice. \rReason: To comply with the provisions of S.51 of the Planning & Compulsory Purchase Act 2004.\r",
    "The development hereby approved shall be carried out in accordance with the following approved plans and documents:\r \rLocation Plan; Transport Impact Assessment; Proposed Plan.\r\rReason: For the avoidance of doubt and in the interests of proper planning. \r",
    "No independent cooking or laundry facilities shall be installed in any of the respective bedrooms, and the communal bathrooms, kitchen and office shall be retained as such in perpetuity.\r\rReason: To accord with the stipulations of definition as a House of Multiple Occupation and to safeguard the residential character of the surrounding area.\r",
    "Prior to occupation, unless otherwise agreed, cycle parking should be provided in compliance with the following criteria:\r\r- Provision of a minimum of FOUR long stay cycle parking spaces, one per HMO bedroom.\r\r- In an accessible location: The access route to the cycle parking enclosures should be a minimum of 1.2 metres wide to enable the bike to enter the store. It should be step free and involve no more than two doors or gates, excluding the store door, which must also have a minimum opening width of 1.2 metres.\r\r- Long stay must be secured with a British Standard mortice lock or access fob.\r\r- Long stay must be fully enclosed with four walls and a roof.\r\rReason: The Council's Climate Action and Transport Policies seek to increase the use of active and sustainable transport modes. This means that access to bicycle parking should be easy and secure to remove potential barriers to cycling.",
    "The development hereby permitted shall not be occupied until refuse storage facilities including facilities for the recycling of waste to satisfy the future number of occupiers on site have been provided and thereafter maintained unless otherwise in writing by the Local Planning Authority.\r\rReason: In the interests of amenity and the recycling of waste materials in support of the Boroughs waste reduction targets. \r",
    "The use of the property as a House in Multiple Occupation hereby approved shall be occupied by a maximum of 4 people at any one time and shall not be subdivided or occupied as self-contained units. \r\rReason: To accord with the stipulations of definition as a House of Multiple Occupation and to safeguard the residential character of the surrounding area.\r",
    "The outbuilding hereby permitted shall not be occupied at any time other than for purposes ancillary to the residential use of the existing dwelling and shall not be used as an independent dwelling at any time.  \r \rReason: To ensure that the development complies with adopted standards, does not impact on neighbouring amenity, and that it is in character with the form of development in the locality, in accordance with relevant adopted planning policies of the Enfield Local Plan.\r"
