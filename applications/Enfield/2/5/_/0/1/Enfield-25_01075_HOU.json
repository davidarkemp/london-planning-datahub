    "The proposed development, by reason of its siting on a classified road and the insufficient space within the curtilage of the site for a vehicle to turn so that it may both enter and leave the site in a forward gear, would lead to vehicles reversing from or onto the Classified Road to the detriment of the safety and free flow of traffic, in particular the effective movement of bus services. The proposal is therefore contrary to policy DMD 46 of the Development Management Document (2014) and Transport for London's Technical Guidance on footways and carriages.\r\r\r\r"
