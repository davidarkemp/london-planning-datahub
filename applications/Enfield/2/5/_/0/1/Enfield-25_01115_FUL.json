  "decision_conditions": [
    "The development hereby permitted must be begun not later than the end of three years from the date of this permission.\r\rReason: To comply with the provisions of S.51 of the Planning & Compulsory Purchase Act 2004.\r",
    "The development hereby permitted shall be carried out in accordance with the following approved plans:\r\rSH1_RevA, SH2_RevA, SH3_RevA\r\rReason: For the avoidance of doubt and in the interests of proper planning\r",
    "Unless otherwise specified in the application the materials to be used for the external surfaces of the development hereby permitted along with work of making good shall be carried out in materials to match those of the existing building.\r\rReason: To ensure that the appearance of the development respects the appearance, existing materials and built and natural features of the surrounding area.\r",
    "Notwithstanding the approved plans, no above ground works shall commence until drawings, including sections, to a scale of 1:20 or larger, detailing the proposed windows and doors hereby permitted (including cills, reveals, heads, materials, window furniture) have been submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority. The windows and doors shall be installed in accordance with the approved details.\r\rReason: Reason: To minimise the heritage harm to the listed buildings and conservation area and ensure alignment of the development with the heritage assessment of this application.\r\r",
    "Before the development hereby permitted is first occupied, detailed sub-division of the amenity area(s) and boundary treatment between Longbourn and Coach House shown on drawing SH3_Rev A shall be provided and retained as such thereafter.\r\rReason: To ensure that the development does not prejudice the amenity of future occupiers or the character of the area and to ensure a design would not cause harm to heritage assets. \r",
    "A scheme of hard and soft landscaping, including details of existing trees to be retained and size, species, planting heights, densities and positions of any soft landscaping, shall be submitted to and agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority prior to the occupation of the hereby approved development.\r\rAny existing tree shown to be retained or trees or shrubs to be planted as part of the approved landscaping scheme which are removed, die, become severely damaged or diseased within five years of the completion of development shall be replaced with trees or shrubs of appropriate size and species in the next planting season.\r\rReason: To enhance the biodiversity value of the site beyond its current baseline and that the proposed development does not prejudice the enjoyment of the occupiers of their home\r",
    "The development shall not be occupied until details of the siting, number and design of secure/covered cycle parking spaces have been submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority. The approved details shall thereafter be installed and permanently retained for cycle parking. \r\rReason: The Council's Climate Action and Transport Policies seek to increase the use of active and sustainable transport modes. This means that access to bicycle parking should be easy and secure to remove potential barriers to cycling.\r",
    "The development hereby permitted shall not be occupied until waste storage and recycling facilities to satisfy the future number of occupiers on site have been provided within the development, in accordance with the Enfield's Household Recycling and Waste Planning Guidance for New Developments (February 2024).\r\rReason: In order to facilitate efficient, safe and clean removal of household refuse, the location and accessibility of refuse storage plus to maintain safety on the Highway.\r",
    "Prior to occupation, an Energy Statement confirming the CO2/yr (using SAP 10) reduction over Part L of Building Regulations (2021) shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority. The Energy Statement shall follow the GLA's Energy Assessment Guidance, the 'be lean, be clean, be green' reduction hierarchy set out in the London Plan (2021) and aspire to achieve a 35% reduction over Part L of Building Regulations (2021). This should include a detailed feasibility analysis of renewable energy technologies, including assessment of heat pumps as a feasible option for the building.\r\rThe renewable energy technologies included in the Energy Statement shall be incorporated into the development and installed in accordance with the recommendations of Energy Statement prior to first occupation of the development.\r\rReason: In the interest of sustainable development and to ensure that the Local Planning Authority may be satisfied that CO2 emission reduction targets are met in accordance with Policy DMD51 of the Enfield Development Management Document (2014).\r",
    "The development must achieve reduced water consumption through the use of water efficient fittings, appliances and recycling systems to result in consumption equal to or less than 105 litres per person per day.\r\rReason: To promote water conservation and efficiency measures in all new developments and where possible in the retrofitting of existing stock in accordance with Core Policy 21 of the Core Strategy and the London Plan.\r"
