    "The development hereby permitted must be begun not later than the end of three years from the date of this permission. \r\rReason: To comply with the provisions of S.51 of the Planning & Compulsory Purchase Act 2004.\r",
    "The development hereby permitted shall be carried out in accordance with the following approved plans:\r\r034.25/01\r034.25/02\r034.25/03\r034.25/04\r034.25/05\r034.25/06\r034.25/07\r034.25/08\rOS Location Plan\rSuDS proforma\rCIL form\r\rReason: For the avoidance of doubt and in the interests of proper planning.\r",
    "Exempting demolition, the development shall not commence until details of surface drainage works have been submitted and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority. The details shall be based on an assessment of the potential for disposing of surface water by means of a sustainable drainage system in accordance with the principles as set out in the Technical Guidance to the National Planning Policy Framework and shall be designed to a 1 in 100 year storm event allowing for climate change. The drainage system shall be installed/operational prior to the first occupation. The development shall be carried out strictly in accordance with the details so approved and maintained as such thereafter.\r\rREASON: To ensure the sustainable management of water, minimise flood risk, minimise discharge of surface water outside of the curtilage of the property and ensure that the drainage system will remain functional throughout the lifetime of the development in accordance with Policy CP28 of the Core Strategy, DMD Policy 61, and Policies SI12 & SI13 of the London Plan and the NPPF and to maximise opportunities for sustainable development.\r",
    "All new external work shall be carried out in materials that resemble, as closely as possible, in colour and texture as specified in the approved application.\r\rReason: To safeguard the appearance of the premises and the character of the immediate area.\r"
