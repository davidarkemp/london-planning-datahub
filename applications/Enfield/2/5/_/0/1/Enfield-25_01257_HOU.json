    "The proposed front dormer roof extension, increased raising of the ridge height and the awkward angled roof sides, by virtue of their siting, size and location in the roof planes of the subject building, would appear incompatible and inordinate form of development of the host building which would cause noticeable visual disruption to the established roofscape, rhythm of the street scene within the row of houses it forms a part of and the wider area. The development would therefore be contrary to Policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan 2021, CP 30 of the Enfield Core Strategy 2010 and DMD 6, DMD 8, DMD 13 and DMD 37 of the Enfield Development Management Document 2014, as well as the aims of the NPPF (2024)."
