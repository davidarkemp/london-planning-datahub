    "The proposed variation of condition 2 to allow amending the boundary wall and introducing 1.2m high access pedestrian and vehicular gates would appear as incongruous and out-of-character in the street scene in this location,and would limit visibility in manner that is harmful to highway and pedestrian safety and amenity.  Given this, the proposal is not appropriately designed and therefore it fails to comply with policies D3 of the London Plan (2021), with policies DMD37, DMD45 and DMD47 of the Development Management Document (2014), with policies CP25 and CP30 of the Core Strategy (2010), and with Sections 9 and 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2024)."
