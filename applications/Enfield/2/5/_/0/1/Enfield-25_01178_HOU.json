    "The proposed first floor side extension by reason of its siting on the shared boundary, width, height, scale, and extent, would infill the important visual gap between the block of dwellings, disrupting the plot setting and the relationship between properties due to the poor and awkward juxtaposition that would arise. The proposals are thereby contrary to London Plan (2021) Policies D4 and D8, Core Strategy (2010) Policy CP30 and Development Management Document (2014) Policies DMD8, DMD11, DM 14 and DMD37.",
    "The first floor side and rear extension by reason of its height, bulk, scale, and siting on the shared boundary with No.109 would cause significant overbearing, overshadowing, enclosure and loss of light impacts to first-floor rear habitable room window at this un-attached property and this would be harmful to the amenity and living conditions of the occupiers of this neighbouring dwelling. The proposals are thereby contrary to London Plan (2021) Policies D4 and D8, Core Strategy (2010) Policy CP30 and Development Management Document (2014) Policies DMD8, DMD11 and DMD37.",
    "The proposed first floor rear extension roof by virtue of its awkward roof designs, size and siting, against the existing rear dormer and gable end, would be out of keeping with the character of the existing dwelling house and the surrounding area.  The proposal would be contrary to the NPPF (2024), D4 and D5 of the London Plan (2021), DMD 13, DMD 14 and DMD 37 of the Development Management Plan (2014) and CP30 of the Core Strategy (2010)."
