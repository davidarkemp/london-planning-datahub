    "The proposed outbuilding, due to its scale and mass, is excessively large when considering its purpose incidental to the enjoyment of the host property and it would appear dominant and incongruous within the garden setting.  In particular these proportions and siting will increase the sense of enclosure for the neighbouring property.  Furthermore, the proposal fails to respect the proportions, rhythm and pattern of development of both the application site and the wider surrounding area and is not well designed. Therefore, it fails to comply with policy CP30 of the Core Strategy (2010), with policies DMD8, DMD12, and DMD37 of the Development Management Document (2014), with Policy D4 of the London Plan (2021), and with Section 12 of the NPPF (2024)."
