    "The proposed development, by virtue of the detachment of unit 6 from units 4 & 5 and the siting of development closer to the boundary with 34A Slades Hill, would appear as intrusive, discordant, inappropriate and visually out-of-keeping on this garden development site, compromise privacy to 34A Slades Hill and, by virtue of disruption to the form, rhythm, beauty, and landscaping, of the previously consented building, would be harmful to the character and appearance of the previously consented dwellings. Given this, the proposal is not well designed. Therefore, it is contrary to policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021), to policy CP30 of the Core Strategy (2010), to policies DMD6, DMD7, DMD8, DMD37, DMD38 and DMD81 of the Development Management Document (2014), and to Section 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2024)."
