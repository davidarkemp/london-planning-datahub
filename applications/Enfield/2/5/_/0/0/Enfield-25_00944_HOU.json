  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed side, rear and roof extensions, including a part hip-to-gable and rear dormer, would by virtue of their design, scale, siting, form, and visually jarring combination, give rise to an awkward, incongruous, bulky and overbearing form of over-development that would unbalance and detract from the character and symmetry of the semi-detached pair, would harmfully erode the character and appearance of the host dwelling at rear and front, and would be detrimental to the appearance of the streetscene in this location. Given this, the proposal is not well designed. Therefore, it is contrary to Section 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2024), to policies D3, D4, and D8 of the London Plan (2021), to policy CP30 of the Core Strategy (2010), and to polices DMD6, DMD8, DMD11, DMD13, DMD14, DMD37 and DMD38 of the Development Management Document (2014)."
