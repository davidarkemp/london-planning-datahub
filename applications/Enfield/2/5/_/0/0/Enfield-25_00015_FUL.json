    "The proposed development, by virtue of its internal layout and resultant inadequate floor area would provide cramped and substandard accommodation.  Whilst complying with minimum NDSS GIA for a 1 bedroom 1 person home, it does not comply with minimum living space requirements within the Housing Design Standards LPG (C2.5).  This would result in substandard and inappropriate accommodation incapable of meeting the reasonable needs of occupiers, contrary to Section 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2024), Policies D3, D4, D5, D6, D8 of the London Plan (2021), CP30 of the Enfield Core Strategy (2010), DMD6, DMD8, DMD9 and DMD37 of the Enfield Development Management Document (2014) and the London Housing Supplementary Planning Guidance (2016).",
    "The proposed development, by virtue of its design with the scale as per a garage but attempting to mimic the porch design of the adjacent two storey houses is incongruous, awkward and cramped, this would disrupt the rhythm and pattern of the street scene and would be harmful the character of the area. Accordingly, the proposed development fails to comply with policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021), with policy CP30 of the Core Strategy, with policies DMD6, DMD8 and DMD37 of the Development Management Document (2014), and with paragraphs 131 and 135 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2024).",
    "The proposed cycle storage, by virtue of its means of access, location and layout would fail to provide a secure, convenient and high quality facility for all types of bicycles and would fail to promote or prioritise the use of sustainable modes of transport, contrary to Section 9 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2024), Policies T2, T3, T4, T6, T6.1 and T7 of the London Plan (2021), CP24 and CP25 of the Enfield Core Strategy (2010), DMD45, DMD46, DMD47 and DMD48 of the Enfield Development Management Document (2014).",
    "All development will be required to include measures capable of mitigating and adapting to climate change to meet future needs having while regard to technical feasibility and economic viability. The proposed development, in the absence of consistent supporting information fails to demonstrate how the proposal minimises energy-related CO2 emissions and follow the energy hierarchy in the London Plan, contrary to Section 14 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2024), Policies SI 12 of the London Plan (2021), CP20 of the Enfield Core Strategy (2010), DMD49, DMD50, DMD51, DMD53 of the Enfield Development Management Document (2014).",
    "The proposed waste storage, by virtue of its means of access, location and layout, would fail to provide a convenient and accessible facility for managing waste generated by the development, contrary to Section 9 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2024), Policies T2, T3, T4, T6, T6.1 and T7 of the London Plan (2021), CP22 of the Enfield Core Strategy (2010), DMD45, DMD46, DMD47, DMD48 and DMD57of the Enfield Development Management Document (2014) and the Enfield Household Recycling and Waste Planning Guidance for New Developments (2024)."
