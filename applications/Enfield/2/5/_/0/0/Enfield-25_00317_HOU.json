    "The proposed roof extensions by virtue of their siting, design and scale would create additional bulk to the roofscape to represent a dominant and incongruous addition, thereby both unbalancing and detracting from the character and symmetry of the prevailing built form within Bridge Gate. Furthermore, the hip to gable would both unbalance the pair of semis of which it forms a part of and give rise to a series of unrelated roof forms and awkward roof junctions thereby failing to relate to the original architectural merits of the property. The proposals are thereby contrary to Policies D4 of the London Plan (2021), CP30 of the Core Strategy, DMD6, DMD 8, DMD13 and DMD37 of the Development Management Document and the advice contained within the NPPF."
