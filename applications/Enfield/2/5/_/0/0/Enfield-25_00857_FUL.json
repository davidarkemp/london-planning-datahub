    "The proposed dwelling, by reason of its overall scale, bulk, design (in particular the large crown roof), would result in a discordant form of development which would be overly dominant, visually intrusive and out of keeping with the pattern of surrounding development. The proposal would fail to preserve or enhance the character and appearance of the Grange Park Conservation Area contrary to Sections 16(2) and 72(1) of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990. The harm caused is not outweighed by any identified public benefits and therefore the proposal fails to accord with Section 16 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2024, Policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021, Policy 30, 31 of the Core Strategy 2010, and Policy 6, 37 and 44 of the Development Management Document 2014.",
    "The proposed first floor rear terrace, by virtue of its elevated height, siting, width and proximity to the site boundaries would give rise to an increased level of overlooking and an unneighbourly loss of privacy as perceived from neighbouring properties Nos. 76 & 88 The Chine. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies DMD8 and37 of the Enfield Development Management Document (2014).  \r\r\r",
    "In the absence of an adequate arboricultural impact assessment or tree protection plan, the applicant has failed to demonstrate how the silver birch street tree, immediately outside the site and which is of significant visual amenity to the conservation area and biodiversity, would be protected during the period of construction and beyond.  The proposal is therefore contrary to Section 15 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2024), Policies G6 and G7 of the London Plan (2021), CP34 and CP36 of the Enfield Core Strategy (2010), DMD37, DMD79, DMD 80 and DMD81 of the Enfield Development Management Document (2014) and the British Standard for Trees in relation to design, demolition and construction (BS 5837:2012)."
