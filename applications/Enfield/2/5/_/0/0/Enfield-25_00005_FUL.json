    "The proposed development, by reason of inadequate outlook and with a lack of defensible space which is also secure to the ground floor open plan kitchen/ living area, would lead to a loss of privacy. The proposal would therefore result in a substandard form of accommodation that is detrimental to the living conditions of future occupiers of the ground floor flat, contrary to Policy D6 of The London Plan (2021), Policy CP4 of the Core Strategy (2010), Policies DMD5 and DMD8 of the Development Management Document (2014) and requirements of the London Plan Housing Supplementary Planning Guidance and the guidance contained within the National Planning Policy Framework, 2024.",
    "The proposed development, by reason of the lack of private amenity space most notably for the first floor flat, would result in a substandard form of accommodation that would be detrimental to the residential amenities of future occupants. The proposal is therefore contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2024), Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021), Policy CP4 and CP5 of the Enfield Plan Core Strategy (2010), Policies DMD5 and DMD9 of the Development Management Document (2014), and the Technical Housing Standards - Nationally Described Space Standard (2015).",
    "The proposal has failed to demonstrate sufficient measures to ensure that the development is safe from flooding, will not increase flood risk elsewhere and promotes Sustainable Drainage at the site. The proposal is therefore contrary to the NPPF (2024), Policies SI 12 and SI 13 of the London Plan (2021), CP21 and CP28 of Core Strategy (2010) and DMD 60, DMD 61 of the Development Management Document (2014)."
