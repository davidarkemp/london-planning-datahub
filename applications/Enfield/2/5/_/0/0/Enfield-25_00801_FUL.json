    "The development hereby permitted must be begun not later than the end of three years from the date of this permission. \r\rReason: To comply with the provisions of S.51 of the Planning & Compulsory Purchase Act 2004.\r",
    "The development hereby permitted shall be carried out in accordance with the following approved plans:\r\r10/25_1, 10/25_2, 10/25_3, 10/25_4, 10/25_5\r\rReason: For the avoidance of doubt and in the interests of proper planning.\r",
    "All new external work shall be carried out in materials that match those used in the existing building, unless otherwise specified in the approved application.\r\rReason: To ensure a design which complies with Development Plan Policies.\r",
    "The development shall not be occupied until details of the siting, number and design of secure/covered cycle parking spaces have been submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority. The approved details shall thereafter be installed and permanently retained for cycle parking. \r\rReason: The Council's Climate Action and Transport Policies seek to increase the use of active and sustainable transport modes. This means that access to bicycle parking should be easy and secure to remove potential barriers to cycling.\r",
    "The development hereby permitted shall not be occupied until waste storage and recycling facilities to satisfy the future number of occupiers on site have been provided within the development, in accordance with the Enfield's Household Recycling and Waste Planning Guidance for New Developments (February 2024). Such facilities to be retained permanently thereafter. The development hereby permitted shall not be occupied until waste storage and recycling facilities to satisfy the future number of occupiers on site have been provided within the development, in accordance with the Enfield's Household Recycling and Waste Planning Guidance for New Developments (February 2024). Such facilities to be retained permanently thereafter.\r\rReason: In order to facilitate efficient, safe and clean removal of household refuse, the location and accessibility of refuse storage plus to maintain safety on the Highway.\r",

This condition should be read in conjunction with the Informative also attached to the permission. \r\rReason:  In the interests of street scene and on street parking provision\r",
    "Prior to the commencement of above ground works, an updated Energy Statement confirming the CO2/yr (using SAP 10) reduction over Part L of Building Regulations (2021) shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority. The Energy Statement shall follow the GLA's Energy Assessment Guidance, the 'be lean, be clean, be green' reduction hierarchy set out in the London Plan (2021) and aspire to achieve a 35% reduction over Part L of Building Regulations (2021). This should include a detailed feasibility analysis of renewable energy technologies, including assessment of heat pumps as a feasible option for the building. \r\rThe renewable energy technologies included in the Energy Statement shall be incorporated into the development and installed in accordance with the recommendations of Energy Statement prior to first occupation of the development.\r\rReason: In the interest of sustainable development and to ensure that the Local Planning Authority may be satisfied that CO2 emission reduction targets are met in accordance with Policy DMD51 of the Enfield Development Management Document (2014).\r",
    "The development hereby permitted shall not be occupied until a plan showing details of the green roof on the ground floor extension including species, planting density, substrate and a section at scale 1:20 showing that adequate depth is available in terms of the construction and long term viability of the green roof, and a programme for a scheme of maintenance shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority. The green roof shall be fully provided in accordance with the approved details prior to first occupation and thereafter retained and maintained in accordance with the approved scheme of maintenance.\r\rReason: To enhance the biodiversity value of the site beyond its current baseline and that the proposed development does not prejudice the enjoyment of the occupiers of their home\r",
    "The development must achieve reduced water consumption through the use of water efficient fittings, appliances and recycling systems to result in consumption equal to or less than 105 litres per person per day.\r\rReason: To promote water conservation and efficiency measures in all new developments and where possible in the retrofitting of existing stock in accordance with Core Policy 21 of the Core Strategy and the London Plan.\r",
    "The development shall not commence until details of surface drainage works have been submitted and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority. The details shall be based on an assessment of the potential for disposing of surface water by means of a sustainable drainage system in accordance with the principles as set out in the Technical Guidance to the National Planning Policy Framework and shall be designed to a 1 in 100 year storm event allowing for climate change. The drainage system shall be installed/operational prior to the first occupation and a continuing management and maintenance plan put in place to ensure its continued function over the lifetime of the development. The development shall be carried out strictly in accordance with the details so approved and maintained as such thereafter. \r\rReason: To ensure the sustainable management of water, minimise flood risk, minimise discharge of surface water outside of the curtilage of the property and ensure that the drainage system will remain functional throughout the lifetime of the development in accordance with Policy CP28 of the Core Strategy, DMD 61, and Policies of the London Plan and the NPPF. \r",
    "The development shall be constructed/adapted so as to provide sufficient air-borne and structure-borne sound insulation against externally generated noise and vibration. This sound insulation shall ensure that the level of noise generated from external sources shall be no higher than 35 dB(A) from 7am - 11pm in bedrooms, living rooms and dining rooms and 30 dB(A) in bedrooms from 11pm - 7am measured as a LAeq,T. The LAF Max shall not exceed 45dB in bedrooms 11pm - 7am more than 10 times per night. A scheme for mitigation measures shall be submitted to and approved by the Local Planning Authority prior to development taking place. \r\rThe scheme of mitigation shall include suitable alternative ventilation where the internal noise levels exceed the sound pressure levels stated in this condition with the windows open. The approved mitigation scheme shall be implemented in its entirety before any of the units are occupied/the use commences and take into account the Acoustics Ventilation & Overheating Guidance issued by the ANC and IOA.\r\rReason: To protect the local amenity from noise and disturbance\r"
