    "Due to its excessive height, imposing form, and the top-heavy, bulky appearance of the antenna at its apex, and due to its siting in a highly prominent position within the streetscene on the corner junction, the proposal would appear as an insensitive, incongruous, and visually jarring addition to the built environment in this location. Additionally, the proposed development, by virtue of its excessive height and stark utilitarian form, would significantly disrupt the visual relationship with the locally listed Bush Hill Park Hotel. It would interfere with the prominence and legibility of this landmark building in key public views, particularly from the overground station approach. As such, the proposal would undermine the landmark quality and setting of the asset, causing harm to the overall townscape and eroding the visual coherence of the area. The visually jarring proposal would be visible from the Bush Hill Park Conservation Area and would cause harm to the conservation area and to its setting. This harm would not be outweighed by the public benefit of the proposed development. Given this, the proposal fails to comply with policies D4, D8 and HC1 of the London Plan (2021), with policies DMD37 and DMD44 of the Development Management Document (2014), with policies CP30 and CP31 of the Core Strategy (2010), and with Sections 12 and 16 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2024)."
