    "The proposed development, by virtue of the excessive size, siting, bulk, scale, and overall design, of the gable end and flat roof dormer; the siting and number of front rooflights and the design and siting of the front porch and fenestration would disrupt the established roof form, result in a disproportionate roofscape and represent an incongruous, visually intrusive and overly dominant addition to the application dwelling. The proposal would harm the character and appearance of the host building, the surrounding area of which it forms part and the Grange Park Conservation Area, which is not outweighed by any planning benefits, contrary to Sections 12 and 16 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2024), Policies D3, D4, D5, D8, HC1 of the London Plan (2021), CP30 and CP31 of the Enfield Core Strategy (2010), DMD6, DMD8, DMD11, DMD12, DMD13, DMD14, DMD37 and DMD44 of the Enfield Development Management Document (2014)) and Enfield Heritage Strategy 2019 - 2024 (2019)."
