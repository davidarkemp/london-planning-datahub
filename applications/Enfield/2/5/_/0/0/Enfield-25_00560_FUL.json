    "In the absence of authoritative marketing evidence, the applicants have failed to demonstrate that there is no realistic prospect of the building being used as a public house and the loss of the ancillary residential accommodation would adversely affect its future operation, viability and safety. The introduction of a non-conforming residential use could also give rise to increased complaints about noise and other issues from residents that would further undermine its viability. As such, the proposal would likely result in the loss of a public house that could be of an economic, social or cultural value to the local community. The proposal is contrary to Section 6, 8 and 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2024; policies HC7 D11, D13 and D14 of The London Plan 2021; Policies 9, 11, 13 and 30 of the Core Strategy 2010 and Policies DMD17, DMD37 and DMD68 of the Development Management Document 2014.",
    "2.\tThe development would fail to provide adequate communal facilities and would result in a substandard form of accommodation, it would also introduce a non-conforming residential use above a public house and in the absence of information to demonstrate otherwise the future occupiers could be subject to unacceptable noise and disturbance and be subject to  anti-social  behaviour The proposal is therefore detrimental to the living conditions of future occupiers of the development and is contrary to Section 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2023; Policies D6 and D14 of The London Plan 2021, Policies 4 and 30 of the Core Strategy 2010, Policies DMD8,  DMD37 and DMD68 of the Development Management Document 2014 and requirements of the London Plan Housing Supplementary Planning Guidance."
