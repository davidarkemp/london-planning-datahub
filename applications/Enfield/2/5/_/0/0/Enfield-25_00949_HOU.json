    "The proposed front boundary wall, railings and gates, by reason of their excessive height, design and materials proposed, would appear overly dominant, visually intrusive and would unacceptably enclose number 31 Beech Hill Avenue.  This would be out of keeping in the immediate context and would further detract from the open character of the surrounding area. The development is therefore contrary to policy D4 London Plan (2021), policy CP30 of the Enfield Core Strategy (2010), policies DMD6, DMD8 and DMD 37 of the Enfield Development Management Document (2014) and Policy HW-2 of the Hadley Wood Neighbourhood Plan 2023."
