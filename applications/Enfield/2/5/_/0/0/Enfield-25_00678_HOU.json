    "The proposed extension by virtue of its design, size, depth, roof form, mass and siting would be an obtrusive and incongruous form of development that would result in harm to the character and appearance of the application dwelling and area. As a result, the proposed extension would be out of keeping to the established character, form, and pattern of development, detrimental to the visual amenities of the subject property and surrounding area. The proposals are thereby contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF, 2024), London Plan (2021) Policies D4, Core Strategy (2010) Policy CP30 and Development Management Document (2014) Policies DMD8, DMD11 and DMD37.",
    "The proposed extension by reason of its size, siting, depth, and height would have an overbearing effect upon the adjoining properties Nos 70 and 74 Evesham Road, through loss of light, outlook, and sense of enclosure, detrimental to the amenities of the neighbouring occupiers. The proposal is therefore contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF, 2024), London Plan (2021) Policies D4 and D6, Core Strategy CP30 and Development Management Document Policies DMD8, DMD11 and DMD37."
