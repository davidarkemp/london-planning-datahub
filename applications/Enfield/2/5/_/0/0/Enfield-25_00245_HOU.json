    "The proposed extensions, by reason of their scale, bulk, design, materials proposed and pattern of fenestration, would represent disproportionate and out of keeping additions to the existing dwelling which would have a significantly detrimental impact on the character of the existing building and the pair of semi-detached properties of which it forms a part. Furthermore, the proposal would fail to preserve or enhance the character and appearance of the Grange Park Conservation Area contrary to Sections 16(2) and 72(1) of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990. The harm caused is not outweighed by any identified public benefits and therefore the proposal fails to accord with Section 16 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2024, Policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021, Policy 30, 31 of the Core Strategy 2010, and Policy 6, 37 and 44 of the Development Management Document 2014.",
    "In the absence of an adequate Flood Risk Assessment, the proposed scheme fails to appropriately consider and mitigate the risk of flooding from all potential sources and utilise Sustainable Urban Drainage Systems (SuDS) following the drainage hierarchy in the London Plan. Therefore, it is considered the scheme would be unsafe over its lifetime, taking into account the impact of climate change. In view of this, the proposal is contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework 2024, policies SI12 and SI13 of the London Plan 2021 Policies, CP21, CP28 and CP29 of the Core Strategy 2010, Policies DMD 60, DMD 61, DMD 62 and DMD 63 of the Development Management Document 2014 and the Enfield Strategic Flood Risk Assessment."
