    "The change of use has resulted in the loss of a property that would be more appropriately occupied as a single family dwelling house and undermines the need to ensure that a range of housing types are available within the Borough with particular regard to the need to provide appropriate large family sized accommodation. The retrospective flat conversion is thereby contrary to Policies DMD3 and DMD4 of the Development Management Document (2014), CP5 and CP30 of the Core Strategy (2010) and H1 of the London Plan (2021) as well as the advice contained within the NPPF (2021) and the Enfield Strategic Housing Market Assessment (2015).",
    "The development results in the unacceptable intensification of the use of the site, and the flats by reason of their substandard Gross Internal Area, insufficient provision of private amenity space, inadequately sized bedrooms; poor quality, lack of shared living space; privacy, outlook, natural light, ventilation and storage fails to provide an acceptable standard of living conditions for the occupiers of the development. The development is contrary to Section 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2024; policy D6 of The London Plan 2021; Policy 4 of the Core Strategy 2010 and Policies DMD 5 and DMD 8 of the Development Management Document 2014.",
    "The development, by reason of the substantially increased number of occupants, would result in an over intensive use of the building which would give rise to additional noise, disturbance and activity at unsociable hours, more rubbish to be collected, that would detract from the character of the surrounding area, and from the amenities of neighbouring residential occupiers. The proposal is therefore contrary to Section 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2024); Policies D6 and D14 of the London Plan 2021; Policies CP30 and CP32 of the Core Strategy 2010 and policies DMD5, DMD6, DMD8, DMD37 and DMD68 of the Development Management Document (2014).",
    "The retrospective development with a footprint that is hard on the common boundary would have an overbearing impact on the amenity of the adjoining occupiers of this property in terms of sense of enclosure, loss of outlook and overlooking. The proposal is therefore contrary to Section 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2024); Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021), CP30 of the Core Strategy (2010) and Policies DMD8 and DMD37 of the Development Management Document (2014).",
    "The development fails to provide dedicated storage space which could be used for waste management within the confines of the building and no dedicated external storage area for refuse has been indicated on the submitted plans. The proposal would therefore fail to support adequate waste management and the intensification of the use of the site would likely give rise to waste on the adjacent highway to the detriment to the neighbouring environment. The development is therefore contrary to Section 12 of the NPPF (2024), policy D3 of the London Plan 2021; Policies CP4and CP30 of the Council's Core Strategy Policies DMD47 and DMD57 of the Development Management Document and the Council's Waste and Recycling Storage Planning Guidance.",
    "The development, in the absence of adequate cycle storage, fails to provide secure, convenient and adequate facilities for all types of bicycles for future occupiers and is contrary to the aims of the London Plan which aims to promote the use of sustainable modes of transport, reduce car use, promote active modes of transportation and public transport use. The proposal is therefore contrary to Sections 2 and 9 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2024); Policies T5 and T6 of the London Plan 2024; Policy CP25 of the Enfield Core Strategy 2010, Policies DMD45 and DMD47 of the Enfield Development Management Document (2014)."
