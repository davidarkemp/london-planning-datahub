  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed first-floor side extension, by reason of its roof form, height, width, bulk, siting, and proximity to the side boundary, would appear visually intrusive, overly dominant, and incongruous. It would fail to respect the proportions and character of the host dwelling, introduce an increased sense of terracing, and undermine the rhythm and openness that define the street scene. The proposal is therefore contrary to Section 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2024); Policy D4 of the London Plan (2021); Policy CP30 of the Enfield Core Strategy (2010); Policies DMD6, DMD8, DMD14 and DMD37 of the Enfield Development Management Document (2014); and Policies HW-1 and HW-12 of the Hadley Wood Neighbourhood Plan."
