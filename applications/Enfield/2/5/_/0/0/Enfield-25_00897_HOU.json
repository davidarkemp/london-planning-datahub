    "The proposed first floor and roof extension by reason of its scale, bulk, form, height and design, taken together with the chimney removal and proliferation of roof lights, would result in a visually intrusive and overly dominant form of development which would fail to preserve or enhance the character and appearance of the Grange Park Conservation Area contrary to Section and 72(1) of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990. The harm caused is not outweighed by public benefits and therefore fails to accord with Section 16 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2023; Policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021; Policy 44 of the DMD 2014; Policy 31 of the Core Strategy 2010; and Policy DE1, DE4, DE10, and DE15 of the Draft New Local Plan."
