    "The proposed development, in the absence of a site specific Flood Risk Assessment, has failed to demonstrate how the proposal will be safe from surface water flooding on the site and will not increase the risk of flooding elsewhere. In addition, no drawings or maintenance plans for the proposed SuDs measures have been provided in line with the drainage hierarchy in the London Plan.  The proposal is therefore contrary to Section 14 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2024), to policies SI12 and SI 13 of the London Plan (2021), to policies CP21 and CP28 of the Enfield Core Strategy (2010), to policies DMD59, DMD60 and DMD61 of the Enfield Development Management Document (2014), and the Enfield Strategic Flood Risk Assessment."
