    "The proposed development and subdivision of the plot by virtue of the limited dimensions of the plot and siting hard on the common boundary would result in a cramped form of development, which fails to relate to the surrounding spacious form and pattern of development and thereby represents a general overdevelopment of the site that is out of keeping and character with the surrounding form and pattern of development and harmful to the visual amenity of the locality.",
    "The proposed development, by reason of its inadequate floorspace and limited size represents a substandard and inappropriate form of accommodation which would be detrimental to the residential amenities of future occupants. Furthermore, the overall layout and limited source of light and openings to serve habitable rooms is poor and further enhances the poor quality environment to future occupants",
    "The proposed development would fail to provide a good quality of amenity space and living accommodation by virtue of the significant potential for overlooking from existing first floor rear windows serving the terrace, including no's 116 and 118 Galliard Road",
    "Insufficient information has been submitted  to demonstrate appropriate provision for pedestrian access, parking, cycle storage as well as refuse and recycling facilities to serve the proposed unit, contrary to policies DMD7, DMD8, DMD47 and DMD45 of the DMD, CP24 and CP25 of the Core Strategy and T4, T5, T6 and T7 of the London Plan.\r"
