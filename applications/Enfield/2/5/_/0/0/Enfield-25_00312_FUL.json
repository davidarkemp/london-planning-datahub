  "site_name": "",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed conversion would result in the loss of a 3-bedroom family dwelling and fails to provide adequate compensatory family accommodation, leading to a net reduction in family housing within the borough. This outcome undermines the Council's strategic objective to increase the supply of larger (3+ bedroom) units, which are essential to meeting the housing needs of families. The proposal is therefore contrary to Section 5 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2024), Policy GG4 of the London Plan (2021), Policy CP5 of the Core Strategy (2010), Policies DMD4 and DMD5 of the Development Management Document (2014), and the Council's Strategic Housing Market Assessment (SHMA 2015).",
    "The proposed development by virtue of its design and the unbalanced front elevation, would appear as incongruous in a manner which would be detrimental to the appearance of the streetscene in this location. Given this, the proposal is not well designed and, as a result, it fails to comply with policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021), with policy CP30 of the Core Strategy (2010), with policies DMD6, DMD8 and DMD37 of the of the Development Management Document (2014).",
    "The proposed development, due to the provision of an additional dropped kerb which would reduce on-street parking capacity, and in the absence of parking surveys to demonstrate sufficient on street vehicle parking availability commensurate with the use proposed, is considered to compromise existing on-street parking provision to an unacceptable level. Furthermore, the location and layout of the proposed parking spaces is not acceptable. Given this, the proposed development would give rise to conditions prejudicial to the free flow and safety of vehicular traffic and pedestrians, contrary to policies T2, T4, T6 and T6.1 of the London Plan (2021), to policies CP24 and CP25 of the Core Strategy (2010), to policies DMD45, DMD47 and DMD48 of the Development Management Document (2014), and to Section 9 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021)."
