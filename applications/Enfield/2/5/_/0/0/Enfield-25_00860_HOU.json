    "Insufficient information has been submitted to demonstrate that the construction methods for the foundations of the proposed building are acceptable in view of the close relationship of the proposed building and the prominent trees adjacent to the site. In the absence of such inforation the applicant has failed to demonstrate that the development can occur without harming the adjacent trees which are of significant visual amenity and biodiversity value.   The proposal is therefore contrary to Section 15 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2024), Policies G7 of the London Plan (2021), CP36 of the Enfield Core Strategy (2010), DMD37, DMD 80 of the Enfield Development Management Document (2014) and the British Standard for Trees in relation to design, demolition and construction (BS 5837:2012)."
