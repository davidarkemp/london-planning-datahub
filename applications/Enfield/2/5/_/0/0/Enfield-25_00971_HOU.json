    "The proposed two storey side extension, by virtue of its overall size and bulk, its excessive width and detailed design, particularly when viewed in conjunction with the proposed large rear dormer and first floor rear extension, would appear visually intrusive, incongruous, overly dominant and out of keeping with the character and appearance of the host building and the surrounding area of which it forms part. The proposal is therefore contrary to Section 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2024), Policies D4, D5 of the London Plan (2021), CP30 of the Enfield Core Strategy (2010), DMD6, DMD11, DMD13 and DMD37 of the Enfield Development Management Document (2014)."
