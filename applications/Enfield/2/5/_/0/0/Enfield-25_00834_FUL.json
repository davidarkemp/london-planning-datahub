    "Inadequate information has been submitted to demonstrate that the nature of the change of use and intended occupier is appropriate by reason of the altered characteristic from a retail unit to a proposed cafe, restaurant and take away (Use Sui Generis) as outlined in the description of development.  This is given the location of the site, in close proximity to St Edmund's Primary School, in a predominantly residential area which would result in the introduction of an inappropriate sui-generis use, contrary to policies seeking to manage the proliferation of hot food takeaways, being prejudicial to the health and wellbeing of young people and local residents. It would therefore conflict with policy DMD32 of the Development Management Document (2014),with Policies D13 and E9 of the London Plan (2021) and with paragraph 97 of the NPPF (2024).",
    "The proposed development, in the absence of adequate cycle storage, fails to provide a secure, convenient and high quality facility for all types of bicycles and would fail to promote or prioritise the use of sustainable modes of transport, contrary to Section 9 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2024), to policies T2, T3, T4 and T7 of the London Plan (2021), to CP24 and CP25 of the Enfield Core Strategy (2010), and to policies DMD45 and DMD47 of the Enfield Development Management Document (2014).",
    "The nature of the change of use would result in increased activity and general noise and disturbance which would be exacerbated by the proposed opening hours. There is also a kitchen extraction system proposed and the application fails to provide sufficient information to fully assess the impacts of noise potentially generated by the use on the amenities of nearby residential properties.  The proposed development, in the absence of an adequate noise report, fails to demonstrate appropriate measures to reduce adverse exposure to noise, contrary to Section 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2024), to policies D13 and D14 of the London Plan (2021), to policies CP32 of the Enfield Core Strategy (2010), and to policies DMD8 and DMD68 of the Enfield Development Management Document (2014).",
    "The proposed development, in the absence of an adequate flood risk assessment and sustainable drainage strategy, fails to demonstrate how proposed measures manage the risk of flooding and utilise Sustainable Urban Drainage Systems (SuDS) following the drainage hierarchy in the London Plan, contrary to Section 14 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2024), to policies SI 12 and SI 13 of the London Plan (2021), to policies CP21 and CP28 of the Enfield Core Strategy (2010), to policies DMD59, DMD60, DMD61, DMD62 of the Enfield Development Management Document (2014) and to the Enfield Strategic Flood Risk Assessment (2021)."
