A plan providing details of the data that will be collected to demonstrate that the works set out in the remediation strategy in (3) are complete and identifying any requirements for longer-term monitoring of pollutant linkages, maintenance and arrangements for contingency action.\rAny changes to these components require the written consent of the local planning authority. The scheme shall be implemented as approved.\rReason(s): To ensure that the development does not contribute to, and is not put at unacceptable risk from or adversely affected by unacceptable levels of water pollution in line with paragraph 174 of the National Planning Policy Framework.\rTo prevent further deterioration of a water quality element to a lower status class and prevent the recovery of a drinking water protected area in the Upper Lee Chalk groundwater body.\r"
