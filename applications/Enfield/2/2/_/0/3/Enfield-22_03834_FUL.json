    "The proposed residential development by virtue of its incongruous design, size, alien siting and site coverage would result in an overdevelopment and cramped form of accommodation that would be out of keeping and character with the surrounding pattern of development and harmful to the visual amenity of the locality, contrary to Policies CP30 of the Core Strategy, D3 of the London Plan (2021), DMD6, DMD8, and DMD37 of the Development Management Document, as well as the guidance contained within the NPPF (2021).",
    "The proposed dwelling by reason of its siting, spacing, elevational treatments, roof design, ridge line, fenestration and overall design fails to relate to the established rhythms, or to integrate satisfactorily within the established character of the residential street scene at St Mark's Road. Furthermore, the proposed dwelling also fails to establish a successful architectural style of its own, resulting in an incongruous development and poor-quality residential environment for future residents.  The proposal is thereby contrary to policies DMD6, DMD8 and DMD37 of the Enfield's adopted Development Management Document, CP30 of the Core Strategy as well as D3 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "The proposed development due to its design, siting and proximity to existing buildings would represent a poor form of residential accommodation due to the inadequate daylight / sunlight levels to the proposed habitable spaces of the new dwelling. Additionally, the proposed amenity space would be poor quality by virtue of its limited depth, orientation and relationship with the existing terrace of which the site forms a part, thereby resulting in an unacceptable quality of amenity in regard to daylight / sunlight and outlook. The proposals are thereby contrary to policies DMD8, DMD9 and DMD10 of the Development Management Document, CP30 of the Core Strategy, D6 of the London Plan (2021) alongside the Mayor of London's Housing Supplementary Planning Guidance and the advice contained within the National Planning Policy Framework (2021)."
