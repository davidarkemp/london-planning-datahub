    "The proposed extension by reason of its depth and siting along the shared eastern and western boundaries would cause significant overbearing impacts on the ground floor rear windows and external private amenity spaces (patio areas) at No. 236 and No. 232 Princess Avenue causing noticeable loss of daylight/sunlight and leading to overshadowing, a sense of enclosure, and intrusive and obtrusive impacts on these properties. Therefore, the resulting impact would be an unneighbourly form of overdevelopment. As such, the proposed scheme is contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF, 2019), Policies DMD 8 and DMD 11 of the Development Management Document (2014) and Policies CP4 and CP30 of the Core Strategy (2010)."
