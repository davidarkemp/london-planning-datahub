    "Insufficient evidence has been provided to determine if the development will be protected from flooding during a 1 in 100 year fluvial flood depth flood event plus 35% climate change increase. The Flood Risk Assessment (FRA) submitted with application indicates that the ground levels at the site are between 12.71 and 12.78mAOD, +or- 0.15 accuracy, and the 'Bounces Road_SU' node has been relied on which indicates the modelled flood level for a 1 in 100 year plus 20% Climate Change event would be 11.79mAOD. However, other flood nodes in the area suggest that the flood level for a 1 in 100 year plus 20% Climate Change event would be in the flood depths region of 13.40mAOD. While the submitted FRA states that there is a moderate risk of groundwater flooding at the site, this discrepancy between modelled flood levels is not addressed and accordingly insufficient information has been provided to accurately assess flood risk. Further, the proposed flood evacuation route is unacceptable as no safe refuge area is provided and the following information has not been provided: proposed fixed floor level, on-site survey to accurately depict onsite levels, and evidence that the recommended mitigating measures in the FRA have been adopted. For these reasons, it is considered that the scheme has failed to demonstrate compliance with Class M.2 (1) (c) (flood risks in relation to the building) of the Town and country Planning (General Permitted Development) (Amendment)(England) Order 2015 (as amended), as well as Policies DMD 59 and DMD 61 of the Development Management Plan (2014), Policy CP28 of the Core Strategy (2010), Policies SI12 and SI13 of the London Plan (2021), and the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF, 2019",
    "The scheme has failed to satisfactorily demonstrate that there would be adequate window openings in the proposed residential units which would directly impact on the provision of natural light (daylight / sunlight) and ventilation  to the proposed main habitable rooms. This would constitute substandard, poor and oppressive living conditions for future occupiers. As such, the scheme has failed to reasonably comply with Class M.2 (1) (f) (the provision of adequate natural light in all habitable rooms of the dwellinghouses) of the Town and country Planning (General Permitted Development) (Amendment)(England) Order 2015 (as amended), as well as Policies DMD 3, DMD 5, DMD 6 and DMD 8 of the Development Management Plan (2014), Policies CP4 and CP5 of the Core Strategy (2010), Policies D6, H1 and H10 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF, 2019).",
    "The submitted information demonstrates that the proposed cycle parking arrangement will be inadequate as it will be fixed to a wall in the main living area which compromises both its usability and the amenity of the dwelling. In the absence of adequate cycle parking provision, the proposed development fails to promote or prioritise sustainable transport or reduce car usage contrary to Policy CP25 of the Core Strategy (2010) and Policy DMD 45 of the Development Management Document (2014). The proposal would result in an adverse impact on transport and highways in the locality and fails to satisfy Schedule 2, Part 3, Class M, Paragraph M.2. Condition 1 (a) of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (Amendment) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "Inadequate refuse and recycling facilities are provided which would be unworkable and as a result would likely lead to rubbish been stored elsewhere or unlawfully disposed of. In the provision of inadequate refuse and recycling facilities and its management, the proposal fails to demonstrate that it would not result in an adverse effect on highway safety, traffic flows and visual amenity contrary to Policies DMD37 and DMD47 of the Development Management Document (2014). The proposal fails to satisfy Schedule 2, Part 3, Class M, Paragraph M.2. Condition 1 (a) of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (Amendment) (England) Order 2015 (as amended)."
