    "The proposed two storey extension and roof extension, by virtue of their design, form and bulk, would appear visually intrusive, overly dominant and out of keeping with the character and appearance of the property and the surrounding area The proposal is therefore contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D4 of The London Plan (2021), Policy CP30 of the Enfield Core Strategy (2010) and Policies DMD8 and DMD37 of the Enfield Development Management Document (2014).",
    "The proposed development, by virtue of the insufficient provision of communal amenity space, poor quality of outlook, due to the presence of the trees along Kynaston Road, and inappropriate stacking between floors, would result in substandard accommodation and be harmful to the amenities of future occupiers. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy D1 of The London Plan (2021), Policies CP4 and CP30 of the Enfield Core Strategy (2010) and Policies DMD6, DMD8 and DMD9 of the Enfield Development Management Document (2014).",
    "The proposed development, by virtue of its proximity, orientation and siting, would give rise to an unneighbourly loss of privacy and overlooking as perceived from neighbouring properties, including No.1 Kynaston Road.
