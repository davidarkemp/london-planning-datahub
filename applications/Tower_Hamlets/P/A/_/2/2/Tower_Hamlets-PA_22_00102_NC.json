  "description": "T1 London Plane (x1) - Reduce branches extending towards railway power lines by 3m. Reason: General maintenance. To maintain the tree at a smaller size.  T2 London Plane (x1) - Crown lift to 5m. Reason: General maintenance. To maintain the tree at a smaller size.  T3 London Plane (x1) - Reduce lateral branches to give 2m clearance from side of building and 3m vertical clearance. Crown lift low branches to 5m above parking area and 2m over roof of sub-station. Reason: General maintenance. To maintain the tree at a smaller size. T5 London Plane (x1) - Crown lift to 5m over visitor parking area. Reduce lateral branches to give 3m clearance from Lexington. Reason: General maintenance. To maintain the tree at a smaller size. T6 London Plane (x1) - Reduce branches over railway by 2.5-3m (back to previous points of reduction) up to a height of 14m to ensure clearance from power lines. Crown lift to 5m. Reason: General maintenance. To maintain the tree at a smaller size. T26-35 London Planes (x10) - Reduce crowns by 1-1.5m all around. Reason: General maintenance. To maintain the trees at a smaller size.  T45 Honey Locust (x1) - Reduce crown by 2m all around. Reason: General maintenance. To maintain the tree at a smaller size. T46 Honey Locust (x1) - Reduce crown by 1.5m all around. Reason: General maintenance. To maintain the tree at a smaller size. T47 Honey Locust (x1) - Reduce lateral branches by 1m on side facing building. Reason: General maintenance. To maintain the tree at a smaller size. T48 Honey Locust (x1) - Reduce crown by 1-1.5m all around. Reason: General maintenance. To maintain the tree at a smaller size. T74 & 76 Rowan (x2) - Fell to ground level. Reason: Poor vigour. T86 & 87 Bird Cherry (x2) - Thin crowns by 20% and reduce crowns by 1.5m all around. Reason: General maintenance. To maintain the trees at a smaller size. T107 & 108 Cherry (x2) - Reduce lateral branches to give 2m clearance from building. Reason: General maintenance. To maintain the trees at a smaller size. T139 Cherry (x1) - Reduce crown back to previous points of reduction (2m off height and width). Reason: General maintenance. To maintain the tree at a smaller size.",
