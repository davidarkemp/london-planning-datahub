  "description": "Observation requested by London Borough of Southwark for Outline planning permission (all matters reserved) for works of hard and soft landscaping to create a shared public realm space for use by pedestrians and vehicles. The proposals will retain and re-provide access for servicing vehicles to Porters Edge, and will improve the street through the provision of new trees and other planting, alongside new street furniture and surface finishes to enable the use of the space for play and recreation.  The application is submitted alongside planning application ref. 21/AP/2655 which proposes works to Canada water Dockside as part of a masterplan for both sites.  The application is accompanied by an Environmental Statement submitted pursuant to the Town and Country Planning (Environmental Impact Assessment) regulations 2017. If members of the public wish to access a copy of the ES, they can view the documentation on the Council's website. Alternatively, for those wish to purchase an electronic copy, Trium will supply the ES on a USB at a charge of Â£20. For a printed copy, members of the public should contact Trium directly as detailed in ES Volume 1, Chapter 1 Introduction.",
