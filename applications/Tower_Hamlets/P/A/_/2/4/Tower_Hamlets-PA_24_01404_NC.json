          "description": "A new air quality monitoring station is proposed to be installed adjacent to the public footpath in the North East corner of Stepney Green Park, parallel to Redmans Road and adjacent to Hawthorn Green Residential and Nursing Home, London Borough of Tower Hamlets, E1 3AG. The monitoring station will form part of the UK-wide Automatic Urban and Rural Network (AURN). The AURN consists of over 170 monitoring sites across the UK, this site is being established as a new air quality monitoring site for fine particulates (PM2.5). The housing has dimensions of 1.5m x 0.65m x 1.5m (l x d x h), therefore has a footprint of 0.975m2 and a volume of 1.463m3. The housing is to be sited on a 150mm deep concrete plinth of dimensions 1.60m x 0.75m, with four sides of paving slabs measuring 0.6mx0.6m. Images and plans have been included to show the housing and all dimensions. A new power connection is required to the location, with the supply to the monitoring station metered. No new access is required as all groundworks, installation and ongoing operational maintenance will not require specific access requirements. Previously permission for installations of monitoring stations the same size as the one proposed have been granted via permitted development. The installations have been allowed based on Part A of permitted development due the land being owned by Local Authority and the purpose of the monitoring station being the for the purposes of the Crown. Permitted development A. The erection or construction and the maintenance, improvement or other alteration by or on behalf of the Crown of— (a)any small ancillary building, works or equipment on Crown land required for operational purposes; (b)lamp standards, information kiosks, passenger shelters, shelters and seats, telephone boxes, fire alarms, drinking fountains, refuse bins or baskets, barriers for the control of people and vehicles, and similar structures or works required in connection with the operational purposes of the Crown. Interpretation of Class A A.1 The reference in Class A to any small ancillary building, works or equipment is a reference to any ancillary building, works or equipment not exceeding 4 metres in height or 200 cubic metres in capacity.",
