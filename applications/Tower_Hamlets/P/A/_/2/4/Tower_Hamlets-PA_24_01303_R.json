  "description": "Application for planning permission for change of use to the existing commercial kitchen and addition of a half container (20ft) hydroponic farm. We have taken over the lease of the site after the exit of the previous tenants Reef London Ltd. To date Crate to Plate have occupied the three current hydroponic farms and the fridge on site since 2020. Reef were operating a dark kitchen for Deliveroo type operation out of the small commercial kitchen on site. We have now taken possession of the sited kitchen for our use to turn it into a production kitchen to make a variety of sauces out of our produce grown on the site - eg - Crate to Plate Pesto. The kitchen usage will be for the production of jarred and bottled products for the retail market, grown and made in house by Crate to Plate. There will be no works required for the change over of use of the unit. There will be benefits to this change over with regards to operational hours, reduction in noise for the local residents with the removal of delivery scooter noise and kitchen odours as we will not be cooking RTE hot food for delivery. Operational hours will decrease and there will be no activity beyond 18:00 Mon-Fri - reducing the previous activity from 08:00-23:00 7 days a week. In addition to the above we would like to apply to turn the existing ambient storage 20ft container that was previously sited by Reef London Ltd at the back left corner of the site in front of our existing fridge. It is our belief that this was sited without planning permission by Reef and therefore we are adding it to our application. The unit is currently an ambient food safe 20ft storage container that we will convert into a small hydroponic farm to increase our growing capacity of basil to be used to make our pesto. The unit will require the addition of a small temperature control unit to control the farms growing ability. After reading all documentation in line with the whole site we have also discovered that planning was approved for a 4 cycle rack (PA/22/02384/S) that was never implemented by Reef London Ltd so Crate to Plate will be happy to implement this.",
