  "description": "Proposal to install the Community Fibre system at the leopold building as a direct result of demand for true ultrafast fibre optic broadband services. . The scheme is also in accordance with the adopted policy of tower hamlets Council, while also being in full accord with central government guidance, together with the London Plan. In physical terms, the works will witness a very limited change to the existing site and buildings, and our firm belief is that the impact on visual appearance and amenity, together with the listed status of the buildings, both in terms of the buildings themselves, and the wider environment, will be minimal.",
