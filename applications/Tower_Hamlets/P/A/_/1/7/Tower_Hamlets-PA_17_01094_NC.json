  "description": "This project is part of the Thames Estuary Asset Management 2100 (TEAM2100) programme commissioned by the Environment Agency to implement the first 10 years of the Thames Estuary 2100 Plan (TE2100). The wall at #1 Coldharbour is in poor condition (foreshore lowering has resulted in rot and decay of the timber foundations and cavities at the toe). Urgent works were installed in Dec 2015. Site investigation and appraisal have been undertaken to identify the following preferred option to ensure that the wall can continue to function as a flood defence. The following activities consist of: 1. Removal and disposal of urgent (temporary) works 2. Demolition and disposal ? horizontal timber capping and detritus 3. Install stainless steel dowel bars into cavities at toe of wall 4. Install steel sheet toe piles 5. Concrete infill (timber foundation encapsulation and cavity infill) 6. Foreshore protection will comprise Kyowa filter units (ballast filled net gabions) installed in line with the manufacturer?s recommendations (prior to installation timber piles will be cut down to foreshore level). 7. Demolition and disposal ? metal ladder and timber fenders and fixings 8. Replace timber fenders and fixings 9. Filling of small voids within the wall 10. Remediation of core holes 11. Remedial works to downstream adjacent wall (Kintyre House) Please refer to the \"Coldharbour wall remediation and foreshore protection works Spec with the drawings.\" - Detailed plan (Drawing 00003) to improve clarity on which timber piles need to be cut down to foreshore level - Proposed section (Drawing 00006) which includes amendments to dowel bars and more realistic shape of cavity The attached SBR Report provides a good summary of the problem at the foreshore wall along with photographs that will help in understanding the project. The Coldharbour remediation and foreshore protection works document provides details about the planned works please see the revised document.",
