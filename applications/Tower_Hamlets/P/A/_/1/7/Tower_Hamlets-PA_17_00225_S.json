  "description": "Minor Material Amendments to planning permission ref: PA/16/00757, Dated 06/12/2016.  Minor Material Amendments sought to create a terrace serving the office accommodation at a first floor level along with associated works; the creation of the of windows/doors along the eastern elevation serving as access to the proposed terrace on what was previously a largely blank façade other than a small access door. Indeed works propose the reduction in size of a window on the southern façade looking onto this external space.   In addition, the applicant proposes the relocating of an approved plant enclosure; approved to be located in the space where the proposed terrace is to be located, to be built out instead on the roof of the approved flat roof plant room fronting the south side of the proposed terrace. The relocated unit will be set back from all sides of the approved plant room and represent a 1.7m increase in height.  ",
