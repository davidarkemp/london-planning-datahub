  "description": "Application under Section 96A of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended) for non-material amendments to Condition 2 (Approved Plans) and the approved description of development of Full Planning Permission ref. 17/00344/FUL (as amended) dated 20th June 2018.   The proposed non-material amendments to the approved plans for Plot D1 include alterations to the massing of the rooftop setback; alterations to windows and balconies; the introduction of an underground refuse system; alterations to the landscaping proposals including a new boundary fencing; provision of additional play space; removal of steps on eastern elevation; and internal alterations to include a change in unit mix; a reduction in unit numbers (from 152 to 144 dwellings), a reduction in non-residential floorspace (reduced from 213 sqm to 167 sqm), the introduction of a second means of escape stair to building cores; and the provision of additional cycle parking.   The proposed non-material amendment to the description of development would take account of the above changes and would read as:  Full planning permission for the demolition of  the existing buildings and the  development of a mixed-use scheme to include 5 buildings, ranging between 3 and 14 storeys in height, which would comprise 399 residential units (Use Class C3), 125 sqm of employment floorspace (Use Class B1), 167 sqm of flexible commercial/employment space (Use Classes A1/B1), 274 sqm of flexible retail space (Use Classes A1/A3/A4), together with the provision of basement cycle parking, street level car parking, public realm, vehicular access and the replacement of the adjacent river wall",
