  "description": "The construction of five buildings varying in height, from approximately 29m AOD (G+5 storeys) up to a maximum height of approximately 124m AOD (G+32 storeys). The scheme will provide a total floorspace of approximately 70,000m2 gross internal area (GIA).  The scheme proposals will provide for a mixed-use development providing: • Hotel space (use class C1) (approximately 130 hotel rooms), including: - Gym/spa floorspace; - Function space; - Restaurant/Bar and Retail space; and - Plant, ancillary and back of house space. • Residential space (use class C3) (approximately 310 units); • Commercial space (use class B1) (approximately 8,000m2 GIA); • Retail space (approximately 2,100m2 GIA); • Cultural space (approximately 700m2 GIA); and • Landscaping, including a Cultural Square, urban public realm and green spaces, and playspace.  The Proposed Development also proposes to construct a double level basement across most of the site footprint, which will provide approximately 110 car parking spaces, 570 cycle parking spaces, plant, waste storage space, back of house space, and UKPN substations. Access to the below ground car park will be ramp access from Southwark Street and car lift access from Hopton street. ",
