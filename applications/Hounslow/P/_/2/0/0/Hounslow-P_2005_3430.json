    "Condition : 1 - The proposed first floor side extension and single storey rear extension, by reason of its size, bulk, appearance and position in such close proximity to the back of footpath line would constitute an obtrusive feature infilling this prominent open corner. It would be out of character with this property and those adjoining and would cause harm to the living conditions at neighbouring properties through loss of outlook and the appearance of the area generally. It would therefore be contrary to policies ENV B.1.1 (All New Development) and H.6.4 (Extensions and Alterations) of the Adopted UDP and the Residential Extensions Guidelines."
