    "Condition : 1 - The proposal would provide an inappropriate back land development for a separate residential unit which would not be in keeping with the character and appearance of the area.  It would  be harmful to neighbouring residents living conditions through disturbance and would provide an unsatisfactory standard of accommodation for future residents.  This is contrary to adopted policies (All New Development), H.4.1. (Housing Standards and Guidelines), H.6.3 (Backland Development/Infill Development), T.1.4 (Car and Cycle Parking and Servicing Facilities for Developments), and the General Standards and Controls of the Hounslow Unitary Development Plan.",
    "Condition : 2 - The additional residential unit would increase activity on site to the detriment of adjoining residents and would fail to provide a suitable standard of accommodation for future residents.  This is contrary to adopted policies (All New Development), H.4.1. (Housing Standards and Guidelines), H.6.3 (Backland Development/Infill Development), T.1.4 (Car and Cycle Parking and Servicing Facilities for Developments), and the General Standards and Controls of the Hounslow Unitary Development Plan.",
    "Condition : 3 - The proposal fails to show that adequate amenity space and parking would be provided for both residents of 64a Meadowbank Gardens and the proposed unit.  This is contrary to adopted policies (All New Development), H.4.1. (Housing Standards and Guidelines), H.6.3 (Backland Development/Infill Development), T.1.4 (Car and Cycle Parking and Servicing Facilities for Developments), and the General Standards and Controls of the Hounslow Unitary Development Plan."
