    "Condition : 1 - 1/ The proposal, by reason of its location within a residential area out of the town centre, would not be served by adequate public transport and would result in harm to the character and appearance of the area and the living conditions of neighbouring residents, by reason of noise, disturbance and increased levels of general pedestrian and vehicular activity at and within the vicinity of the site. The proposal is therefore contrary to policies ENV-B.1.1 (New Development) and H.7.4 (Bed & Breakfast Accommodation) of the adopted Unitary Development Plan.",
    "Condition : 2 - 2/ The proposal would result in the loss of a house suitable for single-family occupation for which there is an identified need in the borough, contrary to policies H 3.1 (Presumption Against Loss of Residential) and H.7.4 (Bed & Breakfast Accommodation) of the adopted Unitary Development Plan."
