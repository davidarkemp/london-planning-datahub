  "description": "The proposal involves three Hutchison3G antennas, three T-Mobile antennas and four Hutchison3G dishes (1 X 200mm and 3 X 300mm).  Four of the antennas and two of the dishes will be located within a small GRP shroud along the north-eastern elevation.  Two of the antennas will be wall mounted along the south-western elevation and two dishes will be pole mounted so the dishes merely project above the rooftop.  The proposal also includes one Hutchison3G and T-Mobile equipment cabinet at roof level and two T-Mobile equipment cabinets along the southern elevation along the second floor roof, and ancillary equipment (PLEASE NOTE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION RECIEVED CONTAINING RADIO FREQUENCY COMPLIANCE REPORT, ICNIRP CERTIFICATE AND PHOTOMONTAGE)",
