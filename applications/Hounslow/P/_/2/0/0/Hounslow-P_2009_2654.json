    "Condition : 1 - 1.\tThe proposed advert panel, due to the size, location and design would adversely impact on the amenity of the locality and would not preserve the setting of the Wellesley Road Conservation Area. The proposed advert would dominate the pedestrian footpath and result in an overwhelming impact for pedestrians. The advert is not considered to be consistent with Circular 03/2007, the Brentford Area Action Plan Policies 2 and 4 or the Unitary Development Plan Policies ENV B.1.1 (New Development), B.2.2 (Conservation Areas), B.1.4 (Advertisements) and T.4.4 (Road Safety).",
    "Condition : 2 - 2.\tThe proposed advertisement, is considered to result in a potential distraction to motorists, which would be detrimental to general road safety conditions on the Chiswick Roundabout, and fail to have due regard for public safety. In addition, an advert in this location has the potential to change frequently. Accordingly, the proposal is contrary to the Town & Country Planning (Control of Advertisement) Regulations 2007, PPG 19 and would also be contrary to Policies Env-B.1.4 and T 4.4 of the Council's adopted Unitary Development Plan, Brentford Area Action Plan Policy 4 and London Plan policies."
