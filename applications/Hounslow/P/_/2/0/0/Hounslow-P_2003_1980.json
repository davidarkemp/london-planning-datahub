    "Condition : 1 - 1/ The retention and proposed increase of B1 office use at the premises is considered to be inappropriate development, as it would result in the provision of a high trip generating use in an out of town location; insufficient justification has been provided to show there are no suitable alternative towncentre or edge of centre sites available. The development is therefore contrary to Adopted UDP policies ENV.1.1 and E.1.1(a) and Revised Deposit UDP (January 2001) policies ENV-B.1.1, E.1.1 and E.1.2."
