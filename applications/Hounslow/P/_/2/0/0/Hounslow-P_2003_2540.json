    "Condition : 1 - The proposed two-storey four-bedroom detached dwellinghouse, by reason of its size, bulk and position, would represent an unacceptable form of infill development and a cramped overdevelopment of the site, which would fail to meet the Council's private amenity space standards, and would be detrimental to the residential amenity of the future occupiers, contrary to policies ENV-B.1.1, H.1.1, H.4.1 and H.6.3. of the Council's Unitary Development Plan (December 2003)",
    "Condition : 2 - The proposed off-street parking provision, due to its cramped and substandard layout, would fail to meet the Council's parking standards, and would result in conditions prejudicial to the free flow and safe movement of motorists and pedestrians in the area, contrary to Policy T.1.4 and T.5.3 of the Council's Unitary Development Plan (December 2003).",
    "Condition : 3 - The proposed two-storey four-bedroom detached dwellinghouse, by reason of its size, bulk and position, would result in an obtrusive development, out of keeping with pattern of development in the area, and detrimental to the visual amenities of the streetscene, contrary to policies ENV-B.1.1, H.1.1 and H.6.3. of the Council's Unitary Development Plan (December 2003)",
