    "Condition : 1 - The proposed additional storey by reason of its height, bulk and massing would be out of scale with surrounding properties and would be detrimental to the appearance of the Spring Grove Conservation Area. This would be contrary to Policies ENV.1.1, ENV.1.2 and H.3.4 of the Adopted Unitary Development Plan and Policies ENV-B.1.1, ENV-B.1.2 and H.6.4 of the Revised Deposit Unitary Development Plan (2001).",
    "Condition : 2 - The proposal would result in an over-development of the site due to its excessive height, density and inadequate amenity space. It would also result in a poor relationship with existing properties resulting in a significant loss of light and an overbearing impact which would be detrimental to the outlook of the existing flats and surrounding properties. This would thereby be contrary to Policies ENV.1.1, ENV.1.2 and H.3.4 of the Adopted Unitary Development Plan (1996) and Policies ENV-B.1.1, ENV-B.1.2 and H.6.4 of the Revised Deposit Unitary Development Plan (2001).",
    "Condition : 3 - The proposed parking area would result in the loss of an attractive grassed area which would be detrimental to the setting of the building and the character and appearance of the Conservation Area. This would be contrary to Policies ENV.1.1, ENV.1.2 and H.3.4 of the Adopted Unitary Development Plan and Policies ENV-B.1.1, ENV-B.1.2 and H.6.4 of the Revised Deposit Unitary Development Plan (2001).",
    "Condition : 4 - The scheme does not make adequate provision for the disabled and others with mobility problems contrary to Policies ENV-B.1.8 and H.5.1 of the Proposed Unitary Development Plan (2001) and Policies ENV.3.1 and H.4.3 of the Adopted Unitary Development Plan (1996)",
    "Condition : 5 - There would be insufficient car and cycle parking provided as part of this development. This would be likely to lead to additional on-street parking which would be detrimental to highway safety on this corner site and would thereby be contrary to Policies T.1.4 and T.4.4 of the Proposed Unitary Development Plan (2001) and Policies T.2.5 and T.3.6 of the Adopted Unitary Development Plan (1996)."
