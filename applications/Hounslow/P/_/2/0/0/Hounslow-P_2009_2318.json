    "Condition : 1 - 1.\tThe proposed LED advert panels and associated arched structure, by virtue of size, position, design and appearance would have an unacceptable impact on the amenity of the area. The size and scale of the adverts and structure would have an overbearing impact on pedestrians and cyclists at A4 level. The height of the structure is out of character with the immediate surrounding environment and would appear excessive on the skyline, adversely impacting on the amenity of the Great West Corridor and the amenity of the surrounding area. The structure is therefore contrary Planning Policy Guidance 19, Circular 03/2007 and policies ENV-B.1.1 (New Development), ENV-B.1.3 (High Buildings or Structures in areas other than those listed in ENV-B.1.2), ENV-B.1.4 (Advertisements), ENV-P.1.7 (Light Pollution), ENV-N.2.9 (Green Corridors) of the Unitary Development Plan and Policies BAAP1 (Sustainable Development), BAAP2 (Urban Design) and BAAP 4 (The Great West Road) of the Brentford Area Action Plan.",
    "Condition : 2 - 2.\tThe proposed LED advert panels and associated arched structure, by virtue of size, scale and location directly opposite Gunnersbury Park and the Kensington and Chelsea Cemetery would adversely impact on the amenity of the Gunnersbury Park Conservation Area, Historic Park and Metropolitan Open Land area. The location of two illuminated advert panels, at a high level on the skyline would be unduly prominent and would adversely impact on the visual amenity of these locations and the setting of the listed park. The proposal is therefore contrary to Planning Policy Guidance 19, Circular 03/2007 and policies ENV-B.1.1 (New Development), ENV-B.1.2 (High Buildings or Structures in areas other than those listed in ENV-B.1.2), ENV-B.1.4 (Advertisements), ENV-P.1.7 (Light Pollution), ENV-N.2.9 (Green Corridors), ENV-B.2.2 (Conservation Areas), ENV-N.1.5 (Protection of Metropolitan Open Land), ENV-N.1.7 (Development near the Metropolitan Open Land Boundary) and N.1.16 (Historic Parks and Gardens) of the Unitary Development Plan and Policies BAAP1 (Sustainable Development), BAAP2 (Urban Design) and BAAP 4 (The Great West Road) of the Brentford Area Action Plan.",
    "Condition : 3 - 3.\tThe proposed advert panels and structure, represent a potential distraction to motorists on a carriageway where caution is required, which would be detrimental to road safety conditions on the A4 and M4 elevated motorway, and would adversely impact on public safety in accordance with the Town & Country Planning (Control of Advertisement) Regulations 2007, Circular 03/2007, Planning Policy Guidance 19 and would also be contrary to Policies ENV-B.1.1 (New Development), ENV-B.1.4 (Advertisements) and T.4.4 (Road Safety) of the Council's adopted Unitary Development Plan and Brentford Area Action Plan Policy 4.",
    "Condition : 4 - 4.\tThe proposed LED advert panels and structure, represent a potential distraction to motorists on a carriageway where caution is required. The frequency of changes of display, or method of change has not been specified in the application and as a result the LED screens are considered to potentially distract motorists on the A4 and M4 motorway. Accordingly, the proposal fails to have due regard for public safety in accordance with the Town & Country Planning (Control of Advertisement) Regulations 2007, Circular 03/2007, Planning Policy Guidance 19 and would also be contrary to Policies ENV-B.1.1 (New Development), ENV-B.1.4 (Advertisements) and T.4.4 (Road Safety) of the Council's adopted Unitary Development Plan and Brentford Area Action Plan Policy 4."
