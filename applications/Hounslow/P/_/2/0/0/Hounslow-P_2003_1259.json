    "Condition : 1 - The proposed extension would, by reason its position, size, and appearance, represent an incongruous and obtrusive feature which is out of character with the existing properties and is detrimental to the appearance of the street scene. The proposal is contrary to Adopted Unitary Development Plan Policies ENV-1.1 and H.3.4 and Revised Deposit Policies ENV-B.1.1 and H.6.3 and the Residential Extension Guidelines.\r\n",
    "Condition : 2 - The proposed extension would, by reason of its position, size and appearance, have a significant adverse impact on the outlook of the adjoining neighbours, detrimental to the amenities currently enjoyed by the adjoining neighbours. The proposal is contrary to Adopted Unitary Development Plan policies ENV-1.1 and H.3.4 and Revised Deposit Policies ENV-B.1.1 and H.6.3 and the Residential Extension Guidelines.\r\n",
    "Condition : 3 - The proposed development results in an increased requirement for off-street car parking to comply with Council standards.
