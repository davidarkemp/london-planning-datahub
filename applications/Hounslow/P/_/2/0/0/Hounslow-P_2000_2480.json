    "Condition : 1 - 1. The proposed development is contrary to the provisions of the Unitary Development Plan which designates this part of this site for employment use (E3), and the review deposit Unitary Development Plan (M17) which designates the whole site for mixed residential and light industrial use. The loss of the employment site to residential use would unduly affect the opportunity to provide sustainable local job opportunities close to Hounslow Town Centre.\r\n2. Insufficient information has been provided by the applicant for the Council to determine the impact of the development on pedestrian and vehicular safety and the free flow of traffic on the surrounding highway contrary to policies T 1.7 and T 3.6 of the Unitary Development Plan.\r\n"
