    "Condition : 1 - The proposed extension, by reason of its size, position and appearance and would represent a bulky, oppressive and unsympathetic development, which would significantly exceed the building line of Rosemary Avenue, resulting in enclosure to the streetscene at this highly visible junction, and a loss of residential amenity to the adjoining residential properties by reason of enclosure and loss of outlook, contrary to Unitary Development Plan (December 2003) policy ENV-B.1.1.",
    "Condition : 2 - The proposed extension, by reason of its size and position would result in the loss of an existing parking and servicing area, and would fail to meet the Council's parking standards. The proposal would fail to maintain adequate visibility splays for the existing service road to the rear and would fail to provide visibility splays for the proposed roller-shutter access. The proposal would therefore result in an unacceptable decline in highway and pedestrian safety and would be prejudicial to the free flow of traffic in the area, contrary to Adopted Unitary Development Plan (December 2003) policies S.4.5 and T.1.4."
