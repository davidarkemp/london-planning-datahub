The proposal would for this reason be contrary to Policies ENV.1.1 (All New Developments) and H.1.2 (Housing Standards and Guidelines) of the Unitary Development Plan and Policies ENV-B.1.1 (All New Developments) and H.4.1 (Housing Standards and Guidelines) of the Revised Deposit Unitary Development Plan and the Residential Extension Guidelines."
