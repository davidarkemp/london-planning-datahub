    "Condition : 1 - The proposal, due to the excessive number of units proposed, would represent an unacceptable overdevelopment of the site, resulting in cramped accommodation and substandard private amenity space, detrimental to the living conditions of future occupants and neighbours, contrary to policies ENV-B.1.1 (New Development) and H.4.1 (Housing Standards and Guidelines) of the adopted Unitary Development Plan.",
    "Condition : 2 - The proposal would result in the unacceptable loss of a small single-family house for which there is an identified need in the borough, contrary to policy H.3.4 (Conversions of Houses to Flats) of the adopted Unitary Development Plan.",
    "Condition : 3 - The proposed off-street parking and vehicular access due to its substandard layout, the number of spaces proposed and the excessive width of the crossover required, would result in the unacceptable loss of the landscaped garden and two street trees, would harm the appearance of the street scene on the edge of the St Stephens Conservation Area, and would result in conditions prejudicial to pedestrian and highway safety. The proposal is therefore contrary to policies ENV-B.1.1 (New Development), ENV-B.2.2 (Conservation Areas), ENV-N.2.7 (Trees and Community Woodlands) and T.1.4 (Car and Cycle Parking and Servicing Facilities for Developments) of the adopted Unitary Development Plan."
