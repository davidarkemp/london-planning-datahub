    "Condition : 1 - 1.   Alternative access facilities exist to the rear of the property accessed via a service laneway from Uxbridge Road and the proposals would fail to provide adequate visibility to motorists entering and leaving the property. The proposed crossover would therefore result in an unnecessary decline in the general safety of this section of Uxbridge Road, a busy classified road, resulting in detriment to the safety of other road and footway users, contrary to Policy ENV.1.1, T.2.7a and T.3.6 of the Council's adopted UDP and ENV-B.1.1, T.4.4 & T.5.3 of the Revised Deposit UDP (Jan 2001) and associated Supplementary Planning Guidance."
