    "Condition : 1 - 1.\tThe proposed development by virtue of its shape, form, massing and location, would constitute unacceptable backland development, which does not take account of the existing density, nature and character of the surrounding residential area and would not be compatible with or enhance the character of the area. It would therefore be contrary to adopted Unitary Development Plan policies ENV-B 1.1, H 1.1, H 4.1, H 4.2, H 6.3, T 1.4 and T 2.1.\r\n2.\tThe proposed development of a 3-storey terrace and conversion of public house into 7 flats and A3 use would, by reason of the bulk, siting and location of the terrace, and the number of units converted, constitute an overdevelopment of this backland site, resulting in a loss of outlook, privacy and light to nearby residential properties, and in inadequate parking and amenity space provision for future occupiers, contrary to policies ENV-B 1.1, H 4.1 H 4.2 and T 1.4 of the adopted Unitary Development Plan.\r\n   3.    The proposed extensions to the public house and erection of a terrace of houses to the rear would not preserve or enhance the character or appearance of the Thorney Hedge Conservation Area contrary to policy ENV-B 2.2 Conservation Areas of the Council's Unitary Development Plan \r\n4.     The proposed development will result in the loss of residential amenity to nearby residential properties, through loss of outlook, loss of light, loss of privacy, overshadowing and general increased noise and disturbance from the increased number of people and vehicles using the site, contrary to policies ENV-B 1.1, H 4.1, and T 1.4 of the Unitary Development Plan.\r\n"
