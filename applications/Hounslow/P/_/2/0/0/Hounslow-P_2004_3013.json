    "Condition : 1 - 1.\tThe conversion of the single family dwelling into a one and two bedroom flat is not considered appropriate, as the original dwelling is not large enough for conversion and has resulted in the loss of a small house that is suitable for single-family occupation and is therefore contrary with policy H.3.4 (Conversions of Houses to Flats) of The London Borough of Hounslow UDP, Adopted December 2003.\r\n\r\n2.\tThe proposal results in a shortfall of one on-site car parking space, which would be likely to lead to increased congestion, which would be detrimental to the free and safe flow of traffic and is considered contrary with policies H.3.4 (Conversions of Houses to Flats) and T.1.4 (Car and Cycle Parking and Servicing Facilities for Developments) of The London Borough of Hounslow UDP, Adopted December 2003.\r\n\r\n3.\tThe kitchen in the two bedroom flat does not meet the minimum floor area requirement of internal space guidelines for family sized units, while no bathroom has been provided for the ground floor flat, both of which are detrimental to the living conditions of the occupiers of the units and contrary with policy H.3.4 (Conversions of Houses to Flats) of The London Borough of Hounslow UDP, Adopted December 2003.\r\n"
