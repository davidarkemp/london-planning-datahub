The proposed development would result in harm to the living conditions of neighbours by way of increased noise, litter, odour pollution and disturbance and the appearance of the site as a result of the siting of the extraction flue, contrary to Unitary Development Plan policies ENV-B.1.1 (All New Development) and S.2.2 (Non-Retail Uses in Other Shopping Areas) of The London Borough of Hounslow UDP, adopted December 2003.\r\n2. The proposal fails to comply with Council's car parking standards and would lead to congestion within local roads, prejudicial to the free flow of vehicles and pedestrian safety within the locality contrary to policy T.1.4 (Car and cycle parking and servicing facilities for developments).\r\n"
