  "decision_conditions": [
    "Condition : 1 - The proposed detached house and garages, by reason of their siting, design and appearance and the loss of the side bay window to No 63 St Stephen's Road, would be out of character with and unsympathetic to the pattern of development in the area and would result in the loss of a mature landscaped garden and mature Holly hedge. The proposal would thereby fail to preserve and enhance the St Stephen's Conservation Area, contrary to policy ENV-B.1.1 and ENV-B 2.2 of the Council's Unitary Development Plan (December 2003) and supplementary planning guidance for the area.",
    "Condition : 2 - The proposed detached dwellinghouse, by reason of its size, two-storey depth, and position relative to the adjoining properties, would be an obtrusive, cramped and unneighbourly overdevelopment of the site, would represent an unacceptable form of infill development, harmful to the living conditions at the adjoining properties by reason of enclosure, loss of light and loss of outlook, contrary to Unitary Development Plan (December 2003) policies ENV-B.1.1, H.1.1 and H.6.3.",
    "Condition : 3 - The use of the proposed garage and shared drive, due to the narrow width and proximity of the drive to the flank windows of number 63, and the position of the double garage within the rear garden, would result in unacceptable noise and disturbance to the adjoining occupiers, contrary to Unitary Development Plan (December 2003) policies ENV-B.1.1 and H.6.3."
