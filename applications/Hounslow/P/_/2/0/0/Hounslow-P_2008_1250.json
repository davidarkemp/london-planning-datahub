    "Condition : 1 - The proposed erection of a single storey rear extension to the existing house is unacceptable and unneighbourly, as the size and design of the extension would unduly reduce the amenity of the neighbouring flat, through loss of outlook and loss of light. Therefore the proposed development conflicts with the relevant London Borough of Hounslow Unitary Development Plan 2003 policies ENV-B.1.1 New Development, ENV-B.2.2 Conservation Areas and H.6.4 Extensions and Alterations and Residential Extension Guidelines.\r\n2.\tThe proposed partial pitch detail of the roof to the proposed single storey extension would detract from the original character of the house, and fail to preserve or enhance the historic or architectural character of the Bedford Park Conservation Area and would also fail to comply with the aims of policies Env-B.1.1 and Env-B.2.2 of the Council's 2003 UDP, nor section 8 of the Residential Extension Guidelines (SPG Adopted by Hounslow 2003). \r\n"
