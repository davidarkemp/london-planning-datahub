    "Condition : 1 - The single storey rear conservatory, by reason of its size, bulk, appearance and position, to the rear of the existing extension, constitutes an obtrusive feature which Is out of character with the surrounding area and harms the living conditions of neighbouring property by reason of its overbearing effect and sense of enclosure and through the unacceptable loss of daylight to the neighbouring property. It is therefore contrary to Policies ENV B.1.1 (New Development) and H.6.4 (Extensions and Alterations) of the adopted Unitary Development Plan and the Residential Extension Guidelines.",
    "Condition : 2 - Informative : The applicant is advised to contact Thames Water on 0845 850 2777 as there are public sewers crossing this site."
