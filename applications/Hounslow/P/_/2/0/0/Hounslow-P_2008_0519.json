    "Condition : 1 - 1/ The proposed erection of the two houses would, by reason of their position, design and appearance, as well as the loss of local open space, have a harmful impact upon the appearance and character of the surrounding area and street scene, over developing the site.  As such, the proposal is contrary to the Policies ENV-B.1.1 (All New Development) and ENV-N.1.11 (Protection and improvement of local open space) of the Unitary Development Plan. \r\n2/ The proposed erection of the two houses would, by reason of the provision of inadequate amenity space, provide substandard accommodation and is contrary to the Policy ENV-B 1.1 (New Development) and Supplementary Planning Guidance of the Unitary Development Plan.\r\n\r\n3/ The proposal, through its construction of two new houses in the setting of a Listed Building, would create a development harmful to the setting and appearance of the Listed Building. The applicant has provided no justifiable historic reason for the positioning of the houses at the entrance to Worton Hall. Therefore the proposal is contrary to the Policies ENV-B.1.1 (All New Development), ENV-B.2.7 (Alterations to Listed Buildings and buildings of local townscape character) and ENV-B.2.3 (Reuse of Redundant Historic Buildings) of the Unitary Development Plan.\r\n"
