    "Condition : 1 - The erection of a rear roof extension and a rear second floor extension with roof windows to front of house, as shown on drawings numbered LR6178/01, LR6178/02, LR6178/03 and LR6178/04, received 3rd November 2006, is recommended for refusal as the proposed extensions would not complement the original dwelling with regard to appearance, scale and design as the roof extension would create the appearance of a large box and it is recommended that both extensions be independent. Furthermore, the proposed roof lights would detract from the character of the dwelling and intrude upon the street scene. The development is therefore not in accordance with policies ENV-B.1.1 (New Development) and H.6.4 (Extensions and Alterations) of the London Borough of Hounslow UDP, adopted December 2003."
