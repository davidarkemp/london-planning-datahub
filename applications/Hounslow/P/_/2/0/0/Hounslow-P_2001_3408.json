    "Condition : 1 - The proposal would be an unneighbourly form of development which would lead to a significant loss of privacy, light and would be visually intrusive and overbearing to occupiers of adjoining properties. It would thereby be contrary to Policies ENV.1.1 and H.3.4 of the Adopted Unitary Development Plan (1996) and Policies ENV-B.1.1, H.6.4 of the Proposed Unitary Development Plan (2001) and Supplementary Planning Guidance on House Extensions (Revised).",
    "Condition : 2 - The proposal would lead to the loss of an attractive building which makes a positive contribution to the character and appearance of the Conservation Area. It would thereby be contrary to Policy ENV 1.2 of the Adopted Unitary Development Plan (1996) and Policy ENV- B.2.2 of the Proposed Unitary Development Plan (2001).",
