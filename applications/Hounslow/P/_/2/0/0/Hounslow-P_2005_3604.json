It would fail to relate to the original house and the surrounding street scene and fails to preserve or enhance the Conservation Area.  Therefore the proposal does not comply with policies ENV-B.1.1 (All New Development), ENV-B.2.2 (Conservation Areas) and H.6.4 (Extensions and Alterations) of the adopted Unitary Development Plan and the Council's Residential Extension Guidelines."
