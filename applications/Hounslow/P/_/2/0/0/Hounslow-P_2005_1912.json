    "Condition : 1 - 1/  The proposed change of use would result in the loss of a retail unit and give rise to an unacceptable increase in associated noise disturbance which is likely to be detrimental to the amenity of the surrounding  properties and is contrary to the Policies  ENVB 1.1 (New Development) and Policy S 2.2 and (Non Retail Uses in Other Shopping Areas) of the Unitary Development Plan.     \r\n2/  Lack of off-street parking  as a result of the proposal would be likely to give rise to conditions prejudicial to the free flow of traffic and general safety in the immediate vicinity.   The proposal is therefore contrary to policy  T1.4 (Car and Cycle Parking and Servicing Facilities for Developments), of the  Unitary Development Plan.\r\n3/  The proposed use lacks adequate facilities for people with disabilities and is contrary to the Policies ENVB 1.8 (Access for People with Disabilities and  S 4.4 (Access to Shopping Facilities) of the  Unitary Development Plan.     \r\n\r\n\r\n"
