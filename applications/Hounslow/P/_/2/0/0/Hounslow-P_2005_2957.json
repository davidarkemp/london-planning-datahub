    "Condition : 1 - The detached building in use as a separate residential unit within the curtilage of an existing single family house is not in a suitable location for such a use.  It does not provide suitable living accommodation for the occupiers of the unit in relation to the Council's policies for internal layout, garden space, off street parking, and servicing, and because it harms  residents' living conditions at No.49 Byron Avenue and neighbouring properties.  This is contrary to adopted policies (All New Development), H.4.1. (Housing Standards and Guidelines), H.6.3 (Backland Development/Infill Development), T.1.4 (Car and Cycle Parking and Servicing Facilities for Developments), and the General Standards and Controls, and Residential Standards and Controls of the Hounslow Unitary Development Plan.\r\n\r\n",
    "Condition : 2 - The detached building due to its excessive size, scale, coverage, and position is harmful to the character and appearance of the area, contrary to adopted policies ENV.B.1.1 (All New Development), H.4.1. (Housing Standards and Guidelines), H.6.3 (Backland Development/Infill Development), and Residential Extension Guidelines of the Hounslow Unitary Development Plan.\r\n",
    "Condition : 3 - The porch and canopy structure due to their excessive size, and their appearance, and covering virtually the whole front width of the house is not in keeping with the character and style of the property, harmful to its appearance and that of the street scene.  This is contrary to the adopted policies (All New Development), H.6.4 (Extensions and Alterations), and Residential Extension Guidelines of the Hounslow Unitary Development Plan.\r\n\r\n",
    "Condition : 4 - The canopy structure due to its excessive size, built up to the west boundary of the site is harmful to residents' living conditions at No.51 Byron Avenue through loss of daylight and sunlight, overshadowing, loss of outlook, and overbearing appearance.  This is contrary to policies (All New Development), H.6.4 (Extensions and Alterations) of the Hounslow Unitary Development Plan."
