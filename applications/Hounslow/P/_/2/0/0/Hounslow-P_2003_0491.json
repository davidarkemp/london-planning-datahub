    "Condition : 1 - The erection of the proposed hoarding would not be compatible with the character of the area in terms of its size, scale, location and design. Furthermore, the proposed hoarding is considered to detract from the visual amenity of the area. The proposal is considered to be contrary to Policies ENV 1.1 and ENV 1.7 of Council's Unitary Development Plan and Policies ENV-B.1.1 and ENV-B.1.4 of Council's Revised Deposit Unitary Development Plan.",
    "Condition : 2 - The proposed advertising hoarding would by reason of its size, prominent position and appearance represent a significant distraction to motorists on adjoining highways and is therefore likely to result in conditions that would prejudice the free flow and safe movement of traffic and pedestrians in the area. The proposal is contrary to policies ENV.1.1 and ENV.1.7 of the Adopted Unitary Development Plan and policies ENV-B.1.1 and ENV-B.1.4 of the Revised Deposit Unitary Development Plan."
