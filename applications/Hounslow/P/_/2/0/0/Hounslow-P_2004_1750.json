    "Condition : 2 - The proposed extensions, by reason of their size and position would result in the loss of a large proportion of the existing parking and servicing area at the premises, and would fail to meet the Council's parking standards, contrary to Unitary Development Plan (December 2003) policies S.4.5 and T.1.4"
