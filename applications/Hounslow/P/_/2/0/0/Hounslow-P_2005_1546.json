    "Condition : 1 - 1/ The proposed house, by reason of its size, design and position within an existing private side garden, would represent an over development of the site and an unacceptable form of infill development, detrimental to the residential amenities of the adjoining properties by reason of enclosure, loss of outlook, overshadowing, loss of privacy and increased noise and disturbance, contrary to policies ENV-B.1.1, H.1.1 and H.6.3 of the adopted Unitary Development Plan.",
    "Condition : 2 - 2/ The proposed house, by reason of its size, position and appearance, would result in an incongruous and overbearing development, which would unbalance this pair of semis, be out of character with this house and the Conservation Area and harm the appearance of the Conservation Area generally. The proposal would fail to enhance or preserve the Conservation Area and therefore is contrary to policies ENV B.1.1, ENV B.2.2. H.1.1 and H.6.3 of the adopted Unitary Development Plan",
    "Condition : 3 - 3/ The proposed off-street parking provision, by reason of its inadequate arrangement, fails to meet the Council's Parking Standards and would result in conditions prejudicial to the free flow and safe movement of motorists and pedestrians in the area, contrary to policies T.1.4 and T.5.3 of the adopted Unitary Development Plan."
