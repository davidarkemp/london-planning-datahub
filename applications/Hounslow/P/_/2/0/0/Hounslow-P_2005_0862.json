  "decision_conditions": [
    "Condition : 1 - Insufficient information has been submitted to determine the impact of the proposal on highway safety, and on the basis of the submitted plans, it is considered that the proposal fails to provide adequate vehicular and pedestrian access arrangements to Vicarage Farm Road. The proposal would thereby be likely to result in conditions prejudicial to the free flow and safe movement of pedestrians and vehicles in the area, contrary to policies ENV-B.1.1 (New Development), T.1.4 (Car and Cycle Parking & Servicing Facilities for Developments) and T.4.4 (Road Safety) of the adopted Unitary Development Plan.",
    "Condition : 2 - Due to its excessive residential density, the number of units proposed, and the poor quality of the adjoining service alley, the proposal would represent an unacceptable overdevelopment of the site, resulting in cramped accommodation, inadequate privacy, substandard private amenity space and would fail to provide safe and secure environment for future residents. The proposal is therefore contrary to policies ENV-B.1.1 (New Development), ENV-B.1.9 (Safety and Security), H.4.1 (Housing Standards and Guidelines) and H.4.2 (Residential Density) of the Council's adopted Unitary Development Plan.",
    "Condition : 3 - Due to its size, position and appearance, the proposal would result in an overbearing, incongruous and un-neighbourly development, which would be at odds with the character of the area, detrimental to neighbour's outlook and would result in the loss of several mature trees, which are subject to a preservation order. The proposal would therefore result in an unacceptable form of backland development contrary to policies ENV-B.1.1 (New Development), H.1.1 (Location of New Housing Development), H.6.3 (Backland Development/ Infill Development) and ENV-N.2.7 (Trees and Community Woodlands) of the Council's adopted Unitary Development Plan."
