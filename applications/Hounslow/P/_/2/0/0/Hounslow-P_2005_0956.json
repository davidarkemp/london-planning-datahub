    "Condition : 1 - The proposed two storey side extension due to its bulk, mass, disproportionate scale, and appearance, would result in an obtrusive development, out of character with the existing and surrounding houses, which would be harmful to the appearance of the street scene.  It would therefore be contrary to policies ENV-B.1.1 (All New Development), H.6.4 (Extensions and Alterations), and supplementary guidance for Residential Extension Guidelines, of the adopted Unitary Development Plan.",
    "Condition : 2 - The proposed development would provide an unsatisfactory off street parking layout in relation to the standards adopted by the Local Planning Authority, therefore giving rise to conditions harmful to the free flow and safety of traffic and pedestrians in the vicinity. It would therefore be contrary to policies ENV-B.1.1 (All New Development), H.6.4 (Extensions and Alterations), T.1.4 (Car and Cycle Parking and Servicing Facilities for Developments), and T.5.3 (Vehicle Crossovers and Hard standings) of the adopted Unitary Development Plan."
