    "Condition : 1 - Reason for Refusal\r\n\r\nIt is considered that the proposed two storey side and rear addition, by way of its design and excessive depth, does not have due regard for the sites characteristics and the dynamics of the existing built environment and would be detrimental to the sun and daylight amenity of the adjoining dwelling at 49 Queens Avenue.  It has the potential to be used as a separate habitable unit and is considered to be an over development of the property, contrary to Adopted UDP policies ENV-B.1.1 (New Development) H.4.1 (Housing standards and Guidelines) and H.6.4 (Extensions and Alterations) of The London Borough of Hounslow UDP, Adopted December 2003 and supplementary planning guidelines."
