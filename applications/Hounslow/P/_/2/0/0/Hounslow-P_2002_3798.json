It would have an adverse impact on the visual amenity of adjoining properties and the streetscene. The proposal does not comply with policies ENV.1.1 and H.3.4 of the Adopted Unitary Development Plan, ENV-B1.1 and H6.4 of the Revised Draft Unitary Development Plan and the Council's Residential Extension Guidelines."
