    "Condition : 1 - This end-of-terrace single-family dwellinghouse is considered to be of an insufficient size for sub-division with regards to the Council's residential conversion guidelines, and the proposal would therefore result in the unacceptable loss of a small house suitable for single-family occupation for which there is an identified need, contrary to policy H.3.4 (Conversions of Houses to Flats) of the Council's Unitary Development Plan (December 2003).",
    "Condition : 2 - The conversion of the single-family dwellinghouse into two self-contained flats, due to the inadequate proposed internal layout, would fail to provide at least one family sized unit and would result in cramped substandard living accommodation for future occupiers, contrary to policy ENV-B.1.1 (New Development), H.3.4 (Conversions of Houses to Flats), H.4.1 (Housing Standards and Guidelines) of the Council's Unitary Development Plan (December 2003) and associated Supplementary Planning Guidance."
