    "Condition : 1 - Reasons for Refusal\r\n\r\n1.\tThe convertion of the existing dwellinghouse into a one and two bedroom flat is not considered appropriate, as the original dwelling is not of a size suitable for conversion.  It would result in the loss of a small house that is suitable for single-family occupation and is therefore contrary with policy H.3.4 (Conversions of Houses to Flats) of The London Borough of Hounslow UDP, Adopted December 2003.\r\n\r\n2.\tThe proposed roof dormer extensions, by way of their size, scale, design and appearance, would not respect the roof face in which they would be set and would have a detrimental effect on the appearance of the dwelling with respect to both the street scene and the immediate locality and are considered contrary to policies ENV-B.1.1 (New Development) and H.6.4 (Extensions and Alterations) of The London Borough of Hounslow UDP, Adopted December 2003; and the Council's Residential Extension Guidelines.  \r\n\r\n3.\tThe proposal to convert the existing dwellinghouse into a one and two-bedroom flat, would result in a shortfall of one on-site car parking space, which would be likely to lead to increased congestion, which would be detrimental to the free and safe flow of traffic and is considered contrary with policies H.3.4 (Conversions of Houses to Flats) and T.1.4 (Car and Cycle Parking and Servicing Facilities for Developments) of The London Borough of Hounslow UDP, Adopted December 2003.\r\n\r\n\r\n"
