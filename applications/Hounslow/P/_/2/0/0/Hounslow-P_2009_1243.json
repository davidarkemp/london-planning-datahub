    "Condition : 1 - The proposed extensions by reason of their size, design and location would harm the living conditions of the surrounding neighbours due to undue overlooking, contrary to adopted Unitary Development Plan policies ENV-B.1.1, and H.4.1, the recommendations set out in the 1997 Supplementary Planning Guidance.\r\n",
    "Condition : 2 - The proposal fails to make adequate provision for off-street car parking and servicing for the proposed residential units. The proposal is therefore inconsistent with the adopted Unitary Development Plan policies ENV-B.1.1 (New Development), H.4.1 (Housing Standards and Guidelines), T.1.4 (Car and Cycle parking and servicing facilities) and the Council's Supplementary Planning Guidance.",
    "Condition : 3 - \r\n3.\tThe proposed development fails to provide suitable accommodation for future residents, due to the location of windows, the size of rooms, the noise levels of the external environment and the lack of private amenity space for the occupants of the new dwellings. This would be contrary to London Plan policies 3A.1 (Increasing London's supply of housing), 3A.6 (Quality of new housing provision) and 4B.5 (creating an inclusive environment) policies ENV-B.1.1 (New Development), ENV-P.1.5 (Noise pollution), H.4.1 (Housing Standards and Guidelines) of the London Borough of Hounslow Unitary Development Plan 2003; and the London Plan and UDP Supplementary Planning Guidance.\r\n",
