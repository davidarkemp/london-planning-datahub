    "Condition : 1 - 1).The proposed development, due to its position and appearance would represent an incongruous structure, over developing the site and creating a cramped appearance to the area, harmful to the street scene and neighbours' living conditions. It would therefore constitute inappropriate infill development and be contrary to policy H.6.3 (Back land Development/Infill Development) and ENV.B.1.1 (All New Development) of the adopted Unitary Development Plan. \r\n\r\n2).The development fails to meet the Council's parking provision requirement by failing to provide an acceptable parking layout for the required four spaces. The current proposal would be prejudicial to vehicle and pedestrian safety and is contrary to adopted Unitary Development Plan policies T.1.4 and H.6.3.\r\n"
