When vehicles move in and out of the garage/ parking area, through the openings in the boundary wall, there would be a road safety hazard to passing pedestrians, detrimental to the amenities of adjoining occupiers and the free flow of traffic and is contrary to the Policies ENV-B 1.1 (New Development)  and T.4.4 (Road Safety) of the  Unitary Development Plan, (2003).     \r\n\r\n\t"
