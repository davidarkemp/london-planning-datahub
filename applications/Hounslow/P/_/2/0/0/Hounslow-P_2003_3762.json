    "Condition : 1 - Reasons for Refusal\r\n\r\n1.\tThe proposed car wash would not provide a suitable level of employment compared with an industrial or warehouse employment use within the existing unit or within a similar sized redeveloped building.  It would also result in the loss of a high trip generating employment use within a key industrial estate and is considered contrary to policy E.1.5 (Development involving the Loss of or Changes in Employment Uses) and the designation of proposal reference E14 (Hanworth Trading Estate) of The London Borough of Hounslow UDP, Adopted December 2003\r\n\r\n2.\tThe proposed car wash would generate traffic in excess of that generated by a general industrial or warehouse unit of the same size, which would increase congestion within in the already busy estate road and given the sites close proximity to the intersection with Hampton Road West would be likely to give rise to conditions prejudicial to road safety and to the free flow of traffic.  It is therefore consider contrary to policies T.4.3 (Traffic Implications of New Development) and T.4.4 (Road Safety) of The London Borough of Hounslow UDP, Adopted December 2003.\r\n\r\n3.\tThe proposed car wash, due to its close proximity to residential property and a lack of sufficient attenuation measures would generate an unacceptable level of noise, which would be detrimental to the living conditions of neighbouring residents and is considered contrary to policies ENV-P.1.5 (Noise Pollution) and E.2.1 (Environmental Criteria) of The London Borough of Hounslow UDP, Adopted December 2003.\r\n"
