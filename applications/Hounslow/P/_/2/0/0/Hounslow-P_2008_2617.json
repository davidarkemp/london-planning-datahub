When vehicles move in and out of the parking area, through the opening in the boundary wall, there would be a road safety hazard to passing pedestrians, detrimental to the amenities of adjoining occupiers and the free flow of traffic and are contrary to the Unitary Development Plan Policies ENV-B 1.1 (New Development) and T.4.4 (Road Safety).     \r\n\r\n\t"
