    "Condition : 2 - The advertisements, incorporating three large illuminated displays represents a potential distraction to motorists, at a point where conditions necessitate drivers' full attention, and would thus be harmful to the safety and free flow of traffic on the adjoining elevated M4 trunk road and the A4 Great West Road which are busy, heavily-trafficked through routes, to adopted Unitary Development Plan Policies ENV B.1.1 (New Development), ENV B.1.4 (Advertisements) and T.4.4 (Traffic Safety) of the adopted Unitary Development Plan and the guidance set out in the relevant national: Planning Policy Guidance relating to advertisements."
