    "Condition : 1 - Reasons for Refusal \r\n\r\n1.\tIt is considered that the proposed end of terrace three bedroom dwellinghouse at 81 Tachbrook Road, by virtue of its size, position, and appearance, represents a cramped infill design and does not have due regard for the sites characteristics, and will be detrimental to the amenity of the adjoining properties and the immediate locality.  The development is therefore considered to be contrary with Adopted UDP policies ENV-B.1.1 (New Development), H.1.1 (Location of New Housing Development), H.4.1 (Housing standards and Guidelines) and H.6.3 (Backland Development/Infill Development) of The London Borough of Hounslow UDP, Adopted December 2003.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
    "Condition : 2 - 2.\tIt is considered that the development does not provide sufficient on-site car parking for both existing dwelling at 81 Tachbrook Road and the proposed end of terrace three bedroom dwellinghouse, leading to increased congestion, which would be detrimental to the free and safe flow of traffic.  The development is therefore considered to be contrary with Adopted UDP policy T.1.4\t(Car and Cycle Parking and Servicing Facilities for Developments) of The London Borough of Hounslow UDP, Adopted December 2003."
