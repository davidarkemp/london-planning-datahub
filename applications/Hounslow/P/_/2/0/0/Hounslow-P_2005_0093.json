    "Condition : 1 - 1)\tThe proposed garage conversion would result in the loss of a parking space at No.65 White Lodge Crescent, which would add to the on-street parking requirement in the vicinity. Furthermore, this would set a precedent for further garage conversions within the estate, which has an already low level of off street parking provision and will therefore have a significant impact upon the on street parking and highway safety. This is contrary to policies ENV-B.1.1 (New Development) and T.1.4 (Car and Cycle Parking and Servicing Facilities for Development) of adopted London Borough of Hounslow Unitary Development Plan Dec 2003.\r\n\r\n",
    "Condition : 2 - 2)\tThe proposed external finish of the garage conversion by reason of its design and relationship to the existing dwellings is considered to be uncharacteristic of the terrace and single dwelling, departing from the original design aesthetic. This is contrary to policy ENV.B.1.1 (New Development) of adopted London Borough of Hounslow Unitary Development Plan Dec 2003.\r\n\t\r\n",
    "Condition : 3 - 3)\tThe proposed detached garage by reason of its siting size and design, fails to provide adequate vision splays and set back from the adjoining highway, which would lead to danger and inconvenience to users of that highway. This is contrary to Policy T.5.3 (Vehicle Crossovers and Hardstandings) adopted London Borough of Hounslow Unitary Development Plan Dec 2003 and the Councils Residential Extension Guidelines 2003.\r\n\r\n",
    "Condition : 4 - 4)\tThe proposed detached garage by reason of its siting fails to provide an adequate gap to the boundary of the site and has a poor relationship to the existing electricity substation, which would have an adverse affect upon the character and appearance of the area, and the amenities of the adjoining residential occupiers at No.63. This is contrary to policy ENV-B.1.1 of the adopted London Borough of Hounslow Unitary Development Plan Dec 2003 and the Councils Residential Extension Guidelines 2003.\r\n"
