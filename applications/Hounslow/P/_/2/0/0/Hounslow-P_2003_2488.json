The proposal would be a cramped form of development, out of character with the locality and detrimental to the amenities of the adjoining neighbours.  The proposal is contrary to Policies ENV1.1 (All new Development), H 1.2 (Housing Standards and Guidelines) H.3.3 (Backland Development /Infill Development) and ENVB 1.1 (New Development) and H 4.1 (Housing Standards and Guidelines) and H.6.3 (Backland Development/Infill Development) of the Council's adopted and revised Unitary Development Plans.",
    "Condition : 2 - 2.\tThe proposal fails to demonstrate that adequate access and manoeuvring  space can be provided and is therefore likely to prejudice the free flow of traffic and the safe and convenient movement of pedestrians and motorists.  The proposal is contrary to Policies ENV1.1 (All new Development), H 1.2 (Housing Standards and Guidelines), H.3.3 (Backland Development /Infill Development) T.2.5 (Car and Cycle Parking) and ENVB 1.1 (New Development) and H 4.1 (Housing Standards and Guidelines),H.6.3 (Backland Development/Infill Development) and T.1.4 (Car and Cycle Parking) of the Council's adopted and revised Unitary Development Plans.\r\n\r\n\r\n"
