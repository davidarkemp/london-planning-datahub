    "Condition : 1 - This purpose built mid-terraced single-family dwellinghouse is considered to be of an insufficient size in accordance with the Council's residential conversion guidelines for sub-division, and the proposal would therefore result in the unacceptable loss of a small house suitable for single-family occupation, contrary to policy H.3.4 of the Council's Unitary Development Plan (December 2003).",
    "Condition : 2 - The conversion of the single-family dwellinghouse into two self-contained flats would represent a cramped overdevelopment of the site, which would fail to meet the Council's standards for internal space provision, and would fail to provide any private amenity space for the first floor flat. The proposal would therefore result in substandard living accommodation detrimental to the residential amenity of the future occupants, would be out of character with the adjoining development and would result in increased noise and disturbance to the adjoining occupiers, contrary to policies ENV-B.1.1, H.3.4 and H.4.1 of the Council's Unitary Development Plan (December 2003)."
