The proposal would be contrary to policies ENV.1.1, H1.1, H.1.2 and H.3.3 of the Unitary Development Plan and Policies ENV-B.1.1, H.1.1, H.4.1 and H.6.3 of the UDP Proposed Alterations Revised Deposit.",
    "Condition : 2 - The proposed dwelling would,  by reason of its size, location and design, be an overly-dominant feature that would cause loss of outlook and would dominate adjoining development at No. 12 and 14 Finch Drive. The proposed development is therefore considered to harm the amenities of those properties, and is contrary to policies ENV.1.1, H.1.2 and H.3.3 of the Unitary Development Plan and ENV-B.1.1, H.4.1 and H.6.3 of the UDP Proposed Alterations Revised Deposit."
