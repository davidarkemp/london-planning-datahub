    "Condition : 1 - The proposed two-storey side and front extension, because of its design, appearance and forward position, would fail to be secondary to the original proportions of the house and would harm the character of the house and street scene, contrary to adopted Unitary Development Plan policies ENV-B.1.1 (New Development), H.6.4 (Extensions and Alterations) and the Council's Residential Extensions Guidelines.",
    "Condition : 2 - The proposal would result in the loss of the existing garage, and would fail to meet the Council's parking standards, contrary to adopted Unitary Development Plan policies ENV-B.1.1 (New Development) and T.1.4 (Car and Cycle Parking and Servicing for Developments).",
    "Condition : 3 - In the absence of consistent plans and elevations, the Local Planning Authority has no other option than to refuse this planning application, as it is not possible to determine exactly what is proposed."
