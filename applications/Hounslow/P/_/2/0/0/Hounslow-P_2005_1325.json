  "decision_conditions": [
    "Condition : 1 - The development hereby permitted shall be begun before the expiration of five years from the date of this permission.\r\n(Reason.  To accord with the provisions of Section 92(1) of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990)",
    "Condition : 2 - The materials to be used in the construction of the external surfaces of the extension hereby permitted shall match those used in the existing building.\r\n\r\n(Reason.  In order to safeguard the visual amenity of the area and building.)",
    "Condition : 3 - The proposed development shall be carried out in all respects in accordance with the proposals contained in the application and the plans submitted therewith and approved by the Local Planning Authority, or as shall have been otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority before the building is used.\r\n\r\n(Reason.  To ensure the development is carried out in accordance with the planning permission)",
    "Condition : 4 - The extension [building] hereby permitted shall not be occupied at any time other than for purposes ancillary to the residential use of the dwelling known as 56 Roseheath Road.\r\n\r\n(Reason.  The accommodation is considered unsuitable for occupation by a separate person or household not related to the occupiers of the single family dwelling to which it is attached, and such use would have a detrimental effect upon the character of the neighbourhood.)",
    "Condition : 5 - No additional flank windows or other glazed openings shall be formed in the western flank wall of the extension hereby approved without the prior written consent of the Local Planning Authority.\r\n\r\n(Reason.  To protect the amenities of the neighbouring residential property against increased overlooking with resultant loss of privacy.)",
    "Condition : 6 - The proposed extensions would not be harmful to neighbouring residents' living conditions nor the appearance of the building and surrounding area, in compliance with policies ENV-B.1.1 (All New Development), H.6.4 (Extensions and Alterations), and the Residential Extension Guidelines of the adopted Hounslow Unitary Development Plan."
