    "Condition : 1 - The proposed development would result in inappropriate infill development contrary to policy H.6.3 (Backland/Infill development) of the adopted Unitary Development Plan 2003 by resulting in the loss of a back garden, which contributes to the character of the wider residential area and fails to take account of the character of the surrounding residential area, which mainly consists of semi-detached and terraced houses following consistent building lines.",
    "Condition : 2 - The proposed development would be of a piecemeal nature and would create an isolated development on this section of Cottington Road. It would have a fragmented relationship with the surrounding properties, which would fail to enhance the townscape value of the area, contrary to policy ENV-B.1.1 and would result in a loss of amenity to the adjacent property No.20 Hounslow Road."
