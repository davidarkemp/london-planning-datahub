    "Condition : 1 - The proposed development due to its site coverage, size, scale, excessive density and inadequate private garden space for each of the flats would result in the over development of the site, harmful to the living conditions of future occupiers and of neighbouring residents.  It is therefore contrary to policies ENV-B.1.1 (New Development), H.4.1 (Housing Standards and Guidelines), H.4.2. Residential Density, H.6.3 (Back land Development/Infill Development), and supplementary planning guidance of the adopted Hounslow Unitary Development Plan.",
    "Condition : 2 - The proposed development by reason of its position, scale, massing, bulk, design, and cramped appearance, would not be in keeping with the form, character, and style of surrounding development and would therefore be harmful to the street scene and the appearance of the area as a whole.  It is therefore contrary to policies ENV-B.1.1 (New Development), H.4.1 (Housing Standards and Guidelines), H.6.3 (Backland Development/Infill Development), and supplementary planning guidance of the adopted Hounslow Unitary Development Plan.",
    "Condition : 3 - The proposed development by reason of its position, size and scale, would be harmful to neighbouring residents' living conditions through overlooking, unaceptable sense of enclosure and loss of outlook.  It is therefore contrary to policies ENV-B.1.1 (New Development), H.4.1 (Housing Standards and Guidelines), H.6.3 (Backland Development/Infill Development), of the adopted HounslowUnitary Development Plan."
