    "Condition : 1 - 1.  The proposed extension of opening hours is considered to cause an increase in the demand for street parking which would adversely affect the availability of street parking for residents in the evening.  As the surrounding Controlled Parking Schemes are saturated and a known demand exists, the proposal is found contrary to policies T.1.4 (Car parking for developments) and T.5.2 (Reducing traffic nuisance in residential areas) of the Council's UDP, 2003.  Also, no on-site parking is provided contrary to Appendix 3 (Car parking standards) of the UDP, 2003.\r\n\r\n2.\tThe proposed extension of hours of operations, in conjunction with the cumulative effect of other A3 uses in this area,  would affect the amenity of surrounding residents, especially the residents of flats above the application site and adjoining properties in terms of noise pollution and disturbance contrary to policy ENV-B.1.1 (New Development) and ENV-P.1.5 (Noise Pollution) of the Council's UDP, 2003. \r\n\r\n\r\n"
