    "Condition : 1 - The proposed extension by reason of its siting, location and design, would be imposing and dominating in relation to the public footpath and No.14 Glen Walk, whilst also producing a front elevation that is out of keeping with the existing dwelling due to its scale and massing. This would result in the proposal having a significant adverse affect upon the amenities of the area and upon the outlook of No.14 Glen Walk. This is contrary to policies ENV.B.1.1 (New Development) and H.6.4 (Extensions and alterations) of the London Borough of Hounslow Unitary Development Plan 2002 and the Hounslow Council Residential Extension Guidelines 2003."
