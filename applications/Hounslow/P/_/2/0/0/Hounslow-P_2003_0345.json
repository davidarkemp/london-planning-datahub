    "Condition : 1 - 1.\tThe proposal for erection of an elevated advertising structure including nos 2 advertising panels would not be compatible with the character of the area in terms of its size, scale, location and design. Furthermore, the existing tower structure is considered to detract from the visual amenity of the area and contributes to the on-going proliferation of advertising signage at the site. The proposal is considered to be contrary to Policies ENV 1.1 and ENV 1.7 of Council's Unitary Development Plan.",
    "Condition : 2 - 2.\tThe proposal to erect the tower structure and signage panels is unacceptable in that the structure and subsequent signage will result in a distraction to drivers travelling along the M4 motorway and is an unacceptable traffic hazard in the area."
