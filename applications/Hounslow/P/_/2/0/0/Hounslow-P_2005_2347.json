    "Condition : 1 - 1.\tThe proposed demolition of existing garage and house extension and the erection of 3 x 3 bedroom terraced houses and associated parking to existing site would result in overdevelopment of the site and would be considered to be backland development resulting in a detrimental impact on the amenity of No.87 and No.89 in terms of loss of light, loss of outlook, massing and the creation of general noise and disturbance for other neighbouring properties. This would be contrary to policies H.6.3 (Backland Development/Infill development) and ENV-B.1.1 (New Development) of the Unitary Development Plan adopted 2003 and the principle of this type of development cannot be established.",
    "Condition : 2 - 2.\tThe proposed development would be likely to be detrimental to the safety of drivers, passengers, cyclists and pedestrians due to the proposed use of the narrow access route for both private and service vehicles. This is contrary to policy T.4.4 (Road safety) of the Unitary Development Plan adopted 2003.",
    "Condition : 3 - 3.\tThe proposed development because of its appearance would not enhance the townscape value of the area through good urban design and is not considered to be in keeping with the appearance of the surrounding streetscene contrary to policy ENV-B.1.1 (New Development) of the Unitary Development Plan adopted 2003."
