(Vehicle Crossings and Hardstandings) of The London Borough of Hounslow UDP, Adopted December 2003.\r\n\r\n",

In addition, it is not considered necessary, as vehicular access already exists to the rear of the property and is contrary to Adopted UDP policies T.4.4 (Road Safety) and T.5.3. (Vehicle Crossings and Hardstandings) of The London Borough of Hounslow UDP, Adopted December 2003.\r\n"
