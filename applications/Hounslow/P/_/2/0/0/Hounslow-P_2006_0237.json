    "Condition : 1 - The premises are poorly managed and have introduced an unneighbourly activity accommodating transient residents which causes harm to neighbours' living conditions and which has resulted in the loss of a single family house, for which there is an identified need in the borough, in a narrow road where there is inadequate off-street parking to serve the use, which is therefore likely to give rise to unacceptable levels of on-street parking, harmful to the free flow and safety of traffic and pdestrians and to neighbours' living conditions through unacceptable levels of congestion and through loss of outlook."
