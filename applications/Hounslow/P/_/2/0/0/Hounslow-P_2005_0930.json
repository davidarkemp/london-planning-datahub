    "Condition : 1 - The proposal would result in an undesirable loss of 2 retail shop frontages and would detract from the attractiveness, vitality, viability and character of the range of services that this area could continue to provide contrary to the provision of Policy S 1.4 of the Unitary Development Plan.\r\n\r\n2.\tThe proposed development is not considered to preserve or enhance Turnham Green Conservation Area, by way of loss of two small independent retail units and by the visual intrusion of ventilation, contrary to policy ENV-B 2.2 of the Unitary Development Plan.\r\n\r\n3.        The development would result in undue noise and disturbance detrimental to the amenities of neighbouring residents, from both the movements of customers and staff, and the servicing and deliveries to the double unit, contrary to the provision of Policies ENV-B 1.1 and ENV P 1.5 of the Unitary Development Plan.\r\n\r\n4.\tAdequate parking and loading space is not provided and the resulting condition of the relevant sections of adjoining highways would be prejudicial to the free flow of traffic and conditions of general safety and the amenities of the adjoining residential area contrary to the provision of Policies ENV B 1.1 and T.1.4 of the Unitary Development Plan.\r\n\r\n"
