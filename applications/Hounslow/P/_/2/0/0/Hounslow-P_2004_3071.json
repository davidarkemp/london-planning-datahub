    "Condition : 1 - 1.\tThe proposed single storey rear extension, by inclusion of two additional surgeries would result in an additional shortfall of four on-site parking spaces, which would further exacerbate the existing parking problem in both Hamilton Parade and the surrounding streets.  This would be likely to lead to increased congestion, which would be prejudicial to the free flow of traffic and is considered contrary to policies T.1.4 (Car and Cycle Parking and Servicing Facilities for Developments) and T.4.3 (Traffic Implications of New Development) of The London Borough of Hounslow Unitary Development Plan.\r\n\r\n2.\tThe conversion of the first floor into an ancillary office area would result in the loss of viable residential accommodation in a local parade where such a use contributes positively to its vitality and is therefore contrary with policy H.3.3 (The Use of Upper Floors Above Shops and in Town Centres) of The London Borough of Hounslow Unitary Development Plan.\r\n"
