  "decision_conditions": [
    "Condition : 1 - The layout, excessive density and inadequate amenity space would result in an overdevelopment of the site and an unacceptable residential environment for potential occupiers contrary to Policies ENV.1.1, H.1.2 and H.1.4 of the Adopted Unitary Development Plan and Policies ENV-B.1.1, H.3.5, H.4.1 and H.4.2 of the Revised Deposit Unitary Development Plan (2001) and Supplementary Planning Guidance (1997).",
    "Condition : 2 - The proposed residential development would have a significantly detrimental impact on privacy, light and would be overbearing to adjoining neighbours contrary to Policies ENV.1.1 and H.1.2 of the Adopted Unitary Development Plan (1996) and Policies ENV-B.1.1, H.3.5 and H.4.1 of the Revised Deposit Unitary Development Plan (2001) and Supplementary Planning Guidance (1997).",
    "Condition : 3 - The design and siting of the houses would not be acceptable within the existing street scene on this prominent corner site. This would be contrary to Policy ENV.1.1 of the Adopted Unitary Development Plan (1996) and Policy ENV-B.1.1 of the Revised Deposit Unitary Development Plan (2001).",
    "Condition : 4 - There would be insufficient adequately sized and located car parking spaces. Many of the spaces would require excessive and difficult manoueuvring and many are of an inadequate size. This would be detrimental to highway safety on this corner site and would be likely to lead to additional on-street parking. It would thereby be contrary to Policies T.1.4 and T.4.4 of the Proposed Unitary Development Plan (2001) and Policies T.2.5 and T.3.6 of the Adopted Unitary Development Plan (1996).",
    "Condition : 5 - The proposal would not make adequate provision for refuse collection or for access by emergency vehicles to the flats to the rear contrary to Policy H.4.1 of the Proposed Unitary Development Plan (2001) and H.1.2 of the Adopted Unitary Development Plan (1996)."
