Received: 20/10/2014) therewith and approved by the Local Planning Authority, or as shall have been otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority before the building is used.",
    "Condition : 4 - No development shall take place until there has been submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority a plan indicating the positions, design, materials and type of boundary treatment to be erected.

The manifestations shall visually contrast with their surroundings when viewed from both inside and outside the building in all lighting conditions.\r\n \r\nThe door shall either be of an automatic opening type or shall have a 400 millimetre high steel kick plate attached across the full width at the base, and the door edges shall be designed in such a manner that they are clearly identifiable for a person with impaired vision from the adjoining shop windows when closed.\r\n \r\nThe doorway shall have a threshold that is level with the adjoining footway and the internal floor, or shall be designed to have a gradient between the two not exceeding 1:12 that does not impede the passage of a wheelchair.",
    "Condition : 6 - The use shall not commence until a scheme for the ventilation of the premises of an appropriate outlet level, including details of sound attenuation for any necessary plant and the standard or dilution expected has been submitted to and approved by the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Condition : 7 - The development hereby approved shall not be occupied (or in the case of change of use, the use shall not commence) until a secure storage area within the site [142-144 High Street] enclosed by a two metre high close boarded fence to house not less than two 1100 litre galvanised steel Eurobins has been identified and made available, together with facilities for the separation and safe storage of glass, metal, plastics, cardboard, food waste and other recyclable materials which shall then be collected and taken to a suitable facility for recycling.  The storage area and bins shall be made permanently available before the development is first occupied and no waste shall be stored outside the site or other than in the designated area.  The lids of the Eurobins shall be fixed shut at all times other than when waste is being emptied into them.  Non-recyclable and perishable waste shall be removed from site no less frequently than once a week.  Waste shall be removed from the site to a suitable enclosed private storage area or an authorised refuse disposal or recycling site as soon as the bins become full if this is earlier than the time of the normal collection, unless additional covered and enclosed bins (as described above) have been provided and are thereafter made permanently available for the on-site storage of refuse and waste."
