    "Condition : 1 - The proposal would result on a bulky rear roof extension which would not respond to the established character of the area, introducing a discordant feature in the terrace, which would harm the character and appearance of the host building and the streetscene.  It is therefore considered to conflict with policies CC1, CC2 and SC7 of the Local Plan and Section 5.0 of the Residential Extension Guidelines."
