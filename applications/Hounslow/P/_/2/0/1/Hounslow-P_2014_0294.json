    "Condition : 1 - The development hereby permitted shall be begun before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.",
    "Condition : 2 - The proposed development shall be carried out in all respects in accordance with the proposals contained in the application and the plans submitted (Location Plan, Drawing Numbers 1-6, Drawing 00, Design and Access Statement, Flood Risk Assessment received 28/01/14.  ) therewith and approved by the Local Planning Authority, or as shall have been otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority before the building is used.",
    "Condition : 3 - The materials to be used in the construction of the external surfaces of the extension hereby permitted shall match those used in the existing building.",
    "Condition : 4 - Prior to commencement of this development, including any demolition or excavation a  Construction Method Statement shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority. The Construction Method Statement must provide specific details of the excavation, temporary works and construction techniques, including details of the potential impact of the subterranean development on the existing and neighbouring structures, based on the specific site characteristics, including the type of geology and hydrology found in the area, as well as parking arrangements. This must be prepared and signed off by a Chartered Civil Engineer (MICE) or Structural Engineer (MI Struct.E).\r\nThe CMS will need to include borehole /soil test results, site specific construction drawings and calculations in a detailed structural engineering report. In particular, the CMS will need to address the following: \r\n\r\nwhether the geology is capable of supporting the loads and construction techniques to be imposed; \r\n\r\nthe impact of the subterranean development, and associated construction and temporary works, on the structural integrity and natural ability for movement of existing and surrounding structures, utilities, infrastructure and man-made cavities, such as tunnels;\r\n\r\nwhether the development will initiate slope instability which may threaten its neighbours;\r\n\r\nthe impact of the subterranean development on drainage, sewage, surface water and ground water, flows and levels;\r\n\r\nhow any geological, hydrological and structural concerns have been satisfactorily addressed;\r\n\r\nthe engineering details of the scheme, including proposals for the excavation and construction;\r\n\r\nthe impact of the proposed subterranean development on the structural stability of the existing and adjoining buildings, especially listed buildings;\r\n\r\nthe impact of the proposed subterranean development on existing and proposed trees;\r\n\r\nthe sequence for the temporary works, which mitigates the effects on neighbo"
