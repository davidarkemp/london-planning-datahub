    "Condition : 3 - The proposed development shall be carried out in all respects in accordance with the proposals contained in the application and the plans submitted ( Design and Access Statement Received 20/09/18, EX00, EX01, EX02, EX03.

    "Condition : 4 - The outbuilding hereby permitted shall be used incidental to the use of 2 South Side, Chiswick, London W6 0XY, and not as a self-contained dwelling unit nor for business purposes, nor shall any kitchen or bedroom(s) be installed in the outbuilding without the permission of the Local Planning Authority obtained through the submission of a planning application.\r\n\t\r\nReason: The accommodation is considered unsuitable for occupation by a separate person or household not related to the occupiers of the single family dwelling to which it is attached, and such use would harm the character of the neighbourhood and neighbours' living conditions in accordance with policies CC1, CC2, SC6 and SC7 of the Local Plan.\r\n"
