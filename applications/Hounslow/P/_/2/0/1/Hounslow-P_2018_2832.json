  "decision_conditions": [
    "Condition : 1 - The development hereby permitted shall be begun before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.",
    "Condition : 2 - The proposed development shall be carried out in all respects in accordance with the proposals contained in the application and the plans submitted (Site Location Plan, 94 001 & 94 002; received 23/07/2018) therewith and approved by the Local Planning Authority, or as shall have been otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority before the building is used.",
    "Condition : 3 - No development shall take place until samples of the materials to be used in the construction of the external surfaces of the hereby permitted have been submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority.  Development shall be carried out in accordance with the approved details",
    "Condition : 4 - The use hereby permitted for A3 (Restaurant) and A5 (Hot Food Takeaway) purposes shall not be carried on outside the following times: 11:00 to 23:00 Monday to Sunday and on Bank Holidays.",
    "Condition : 5 - There shall be no deliveries of food, equipment or other business materials to the premises and no collection of refuse waste or recyclable materials from the premises except between the hours of 07:00 - 22:00 Monday to Saturday and 09:00 - 20:00 on Sundays and public holidays.",
    "Condition : 6 - Refuse storage arrangements shall be provided within the rear of the site before the use commences and so maintained at all times thereafter.  No waste shall be stored outside the site or outside the bins in the designated area. The lids of the bins shall be kept shut at all times other than when waste is being emptied into them or being removed from site.  Non-recyclable and perishable waste shall be removed from site no less frequently than once a week or as soon as the storage becomes full, whichever is the earlier.",
    "Condition : 7 - The waiting area serving the A5 element of the use shall be no larger than 8 sqm unless otherwise agreed by the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Condition : 8 - a) The cumulative measured or calculated rating level of noise emitted from the mechanical services plant including heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) to which the application refers, shall be 10dB(A) below the existing background noise level, at all times that the mechanical system etc operates. The measured or calculated noise levels shall be determined at the boundary of the nearest ground floor noise sensitive premises or 1 meter from the facade of the nearest first floor (or higher) noise sensitive premises, and in accordance to the latest British Standard 4142; An alternative position for assessment /measurement may be used to allow ease of access, this must be shown on a map and noise propagation calculations detailed to show how the design criteria is achieved.\r\n \r\nb) The plant shall be isolated on adequate proprietary anti-vibration mounts to prevent the structural transmission of vibration and regenerated noise within adjacent or adjoining premises, and these shall be so maintained thereafter.\r\n   \r\nc) Following installation of any mechanical services plant including heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) to which the application refers, a post completion noise assessment shall be submitted for approval to the local planning authority which demonstrates the actual measured rating level of plant operating under normal conditions. All measurements shall be made in accordance with the methodology of BS4142 : 2014 (Methods for rating and assessing industrial and commercial sound) and/or its subsequent amendments. The post completion report shall be both completed and submitted to the local authority within 28 days of completion of the installation for review. \r\n",
    "Condition : 9 - Prior to first use of the hereby approved development, detailed information (including Test reports) to demonstrate that the proposed noise insulation scheme is compliant with the approved and relevant British standard, shall be submitted to and approved by the Local Planning Authority. This shall be done by the carrying out of post completion noise tests carried out by accredited/approved organisations. Noise tests shall be carried out taking account of worst case environmental conditions, such as easterly operations at Heathrow, peak time traffic flows wind speed, direction and presence of temperature inversion. Continuous and full logged data shall be submitted, together with parameters measuring LAeq, 30mins dB, as the upper limit for the indoor ambient noise level, both for new build and refurbishment.\r\n\r\nThe noise insulation scheme shall be implemented prior to occupation and maintained as such at all times thereafter.",
    "Condition : 10 - Any kitchen noise and odour extraction/exhaust system installed must be in compliance with the DEFRA guidance for the control of odour and noise from commercial kitchen exhaust systems and flue stacks should be installed no less than 1m above the fa?ade height of the building."
