    "Condition : 1 - The proposal would cause undue harm to neighbours' living conditions by reason of loss of privacy and increased noise and disturbance. Furthermore, the proposal would introduce a discordant feature in the terrace, which would harm the character and appearance of the host building.  It is therefore considered to conflict with policies CC1, CC2 and SC7 of the Local Plan and Section 5.0 of the Residential Extension Guidelines."
