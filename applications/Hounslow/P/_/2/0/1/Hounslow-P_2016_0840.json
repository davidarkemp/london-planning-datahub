    "Condition : 1 - The proposed mansard roof extension with rear projection would result on a bulky addition that would alter the roofline of the terrace, resulting on an incongruous addition that would harm the character and appearance of Turnham Green Conservation Area, contrary to the provisions of policies CC1, CC2, CC4 and SC7 of the Local Plan and Sections 5.0 and 8.0 of the REGs.\r\n\r\n\r\nDue to its location, the proposed roof extension would result on loss of outlook and increased sense of enclosure on the first and second floor flats at 446 Chiswick High Road, contrary to the provisions of policies CC2 and SC7 of the Local Plan."
