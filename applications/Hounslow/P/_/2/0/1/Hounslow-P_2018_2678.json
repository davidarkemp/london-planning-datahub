    "Condition : 1 - The development hereby permitted shall be begun before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.",
    "Condition : 2 - The materials to be used in the construction of the external surfaces of the extension hereby permitted shall match those used in the existing building.",
    "Condition : 3 - The proposed development shall be carried out in all respects in accordance with the proposals contained in the application and the plans submitted (Block Plan, Location Plan 292/HMC/10/A, Design and Access Statement [received on 26 July 2018] and Proposed/Existing Elevations and 292/HMC/100 [received on 20 August 2018], and Car Parking plan [received on 17 November 2018]) therewith and approved by the Local Planning Authority, or as shall have been otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority before the building is used.",
    "Condition : 4 - Prior to the first beneficial use of the extensions hereby approved, full details (including manufacturers specifications and access to the storage area) of secure covered cycle parking facilities (for not less than 6 bicycles) for the users of the development shall have been submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority, in accordance with London Plan standards. The approved facilities shall be fully implemented and made available for use before the first occupation of the development and thereafter retained for use at all times without obstruction.",
    "Condition : 5 - Prior to first beneficial use of the extensions hereby approved full details of the odour extraction/exhaust service and maintenance schedule shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority. Any kitchen noise and odour extraction/exhaust system installed must be in compliance with the DEFRA guidance for the control of odour and noise from commercial kitchen exhaust systems and flue stacks set no less than one metre above the fa?ade height of the building shall be installed.",
    "Condition : 6 - Mechanical Services Noise Control:\r\na) The cumulative measured or calculated rating level of noise emitted from the mechanical services plant including heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) to which the application refers, shall be 10dB(A) below the existing background noise level, at all times that the mechanical system etc operates. The measured or calculated noise levels shall be determined at the boundary of the nearest ground floor noise sensitive premises or 1 meter from the facade of the nearest first floor (or higher) noise sensitive premises, and in accordance to the latest British Standard 4142; An alternative position for assessment /measurement may be used to allow ease of access, this must be shown on a map and noise propagation calculations detailed to show how the design criteria is achieved. \r\nb) The plant shall be isolated on adequate proprietary anti-vibration mounts to prevent the structural transmission of vibration and regenerated noise within adjacent or adjoining premises, and these shall be so maintained thereafter.   \r\nc) Following installation of any mechanical services plant including heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) to which the application refers, a post completion noise assessment shall be submitted for approval to the local planning authority which demonstrates the actual measured rating level of plant operating under normal conditions. All measurements shall be made in accordance with the methodology of BS4142: 2014 (Methods for rating and assessing industrial and commercial sound) and/or its subsequent amendments. The post completion report shall be both completed and submitted to the local authority within 28 days of completion of the installation for review."
