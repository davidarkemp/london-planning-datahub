    "Condition : 1 - The proposed side infill extension given its overall height, bulk, massing and design would give rise to an incongruous form of development creating an insubordinate extension to the existing property, detrimental to the character and appearance of the Thorney Hedge Conservation Area.  As such the proposed development would be contrary to policies B.1.1, B.2.2 of the Adopted Unitary Development Plan along with policies CC1 and CC2 of the Emerging Local Plan.",
    "Condition : 2 - The proposed extension given the overall height and depth of the proposed extension adjacent to the existing property 55 Thorney Hedge would give rise to an undue sense of enclosure, impacting on the residential amenity of this property.  As such the development would be contrary to policy B.1.1 of the Adopted Unitary Development Plan."
