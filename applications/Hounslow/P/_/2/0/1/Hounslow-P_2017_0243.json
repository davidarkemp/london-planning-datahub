    "Condition : 1 - The proposed two-storey side extension and gable roof, due to its excessive size and scale, as well as its poor design, would create an incongruous addition to the property and street scene, and would result in significant harm to the character and appearance of the area.  It is therefore not considered to comply with adopted Local Plan Policies CC1 (Context and Character), CC2 (Urban Design and Architecture) and SC7 (Residential Extensions and Alterations) or the Residential Extension Guidelines."
