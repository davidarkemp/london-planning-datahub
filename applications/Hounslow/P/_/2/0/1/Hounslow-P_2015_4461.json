    "Condition : 1 - The proposed buildings, by virtue of insufficient external amenity space provision, the proximity to an industrial unit and noise from passing aircraft would result in a sub-standard quality of accommodation. As such the scheme would be contrary to policies EQ5 and SC5 of the adopted Local Plan",
    "Condition : 2 - The proposed buildings, by virtue of their excessive bulk and design would result in an overly dominant form of development that would detract from the character and appearance of neighbouring properties and surrounding area. The proposal would therefore be contrary to policies CC1 and CC2 of the adopted Local Plan.",
    "Condition : 3 - The new dwellings, by virtue of their scale and proximity to the boundary of the site would appear overbearing and intrusive when viewed from neighbouring properties and would result in an unacceptable level of enclosure to amenity space. The proposal would therefore be contrary to policy CC2 of the Councils adopted Local Plan.",
    "Condition : 4 - The new dwellings, by virtue of their scale and proximity to the boundary of the site would result in an unacceptable level of loss of privacy to neighbouring properties. The proposal would therefore be contrary to policy CC2 of the Councils adopted Local Plan.",
    "Condition : 5 - The proposed scheme, by reason of the intensification in use of the site and inadequate access arrangements would result in conditions that would prejudice the free flow of traffic and safe movement of motorists, cyclists and pedestrians in the area. The proposal would therefore be contrary to policy EC2 of the adopted Local Plan"
