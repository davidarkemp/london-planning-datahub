The exit from the wheel washing system shall be constructed from a hard, non-porous surfacing material and sited as far away from the exit to the highway as may be possible given the constraints of the site and the surface shall be kept clean at all times.  Waste water discharged from the wheel washing system shall be stored and disposed of on site and shall not be discharged into the public sewerage system without prior removal of soil, stones and any other suspended material.  The adjoining private access road shall be kept clear of obstruction at all times, the surface kept clear of debris at all times and the surface shall be protected by means of a robust removable temporary cover.\r\n2)\tSuitable measures to minimise dust nuisance caused by the operations to ensure that no dust or other debris is carried on to adjoining and other properties outside the site shall also be provided in accordance with the guidance at http://www.london.gov.uk/mayor/environment/air_quality/docs/construction-dust-bpg.pdf.  Site lighting shall be designed, positioned and directed so as not to intrude on passing drivers on public highways in a hazardous fashion and so as not to direct light into any windows of properties outside the site.\r\n3)\t Before any work starts on site, the developer shall notify all adjoining occupiers in writing of the proposed start date and the likely duration of the project, and include the name of the person"
