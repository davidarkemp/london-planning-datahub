    "Condition : 1 - The London Borough of Hounslow as the Local Planning Authority hereby certify that on 5 August 2015, the proposal as shown on the drawing submitted on 5 August 2015 annotated as 11:A, and as verified on site was not lawful within the meaning of Section 191 and 192 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 for the following reasons:\r\n\r\n1. The proposed hip to gable and rear dormer roof extension would increase the volume of the roof of the original dwellinghouse by over 40 cubic metres. The proposal would therefore fail to comply with Schedule 2, Part 1, Class B (section d(i)) of the Town and Country (General Permitted Development) Order 2015.\r\n\r\n2. The materials proposed to the north eastern elevation of the dormer proposed would not be similar in appearance to those used in the construction of the exterior of the roof, failing to comply with Schedule 2, Part 1, Class B condition B.2 (a) of the Town and Country (General Permitted Development) Order 2015.\r\n"
