    "Condition : 1 - 1.\tThe proposed change of use from office to an education facility is not considered to be acceptable. The proposal is not considered to be sustainable in this location and would result in overflow carparking within the surrounding streets, due to the shortfall of carparking provided on site. This would be detrimental to traffic and parking conditions in the locality. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies C.2.1 (Educational Facilities), T.1.4 (Car and Cycle Parking and Servicing for Developments) and ENV-B.1.1 (New Development) of the Unitary Development Plan."
