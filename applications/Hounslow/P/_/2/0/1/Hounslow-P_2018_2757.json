The conditions reads:\r\nNotwithstanding the provisions of the Town and Country Planning (General Development Order) 1977, or any subsequent legislation, no further extension or additions shall be constructed without the prior permission of the Local Planning Authority. \r\nThis condition removed permitted development rights relating to the enlargement of the property. Accordingly, planning permission will be required for the proposed development."
