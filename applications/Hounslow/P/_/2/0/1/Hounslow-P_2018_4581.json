    "Condition : 1 - .",
    "Condition : 2 - The cumulative measured or calculated rating level of noise emitted from the mechanical services plant including heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) to which the application refers, shall be 10dB(A) below the existing background noise level, at all times that the mechanical system etc operates. The measured or calculated noise levels shall be determined at the boundary of the nearest ground floor noise sensitive premises or 1 metre from the facade of the nearest first floor (or higher) noise sensitive premises, and in accordance with the latest British Standard 4142; If an alternative position for assessment/measurement is used to allow ease of access, this must be shown on a map and noise propagation calculations detailed to show how the design criteria is achieved and, in such case the details of this assessment shall first have been submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority before the equipment is brought into use.",
    "Condition : 3 - The plant shall be isolated on adequate proprietary anti-vibration mounts to prevent the structural transmission of vibration and regenerated noise within adjacent or adjoining premises, and these shall be so maintained thereafter.",
    "Condition : 4 - A post completion noise assessment shall be submitted for approval to the local planning authority which demonstrates the actual measured rating level of plant operating under normal conditions. All measurements shall be made in accordance with the methodology of BS4142: 2014 (Methods for rating and assessing industrial and commercial sound) and/or its subsequent amendments. The post completion report shall be both completed and submitted to the local authority within 28 days of completion of the installation for review.",
    "Condition : 5 - The installed ventilation system shall regularly maintained at regular intervals of three months in accordance with the manufacturer's recommended specification, including the replacement of the carbon filters"
