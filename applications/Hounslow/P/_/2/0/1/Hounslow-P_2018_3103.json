    "Condition : 1 - The development hereby permitted shall be begun before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.",
    "Condition : 2 - The proposed development shall be carried out in all respects in accordance with the proposals contained in the application and the plans submitted (9001, 9002, Spacewise Product Specification - Received 13/08/2018) therewith and approved by the Local Planning Authority, or as shall have been otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority before the building is used.",
    "Condition : 3 - a) The cumulative measured or calculated rating level of noise emitted from the units to which the application refers, shall be 10dB(A) below the existing background noise level, at all times that the units operate. The measured or calculated noise levels shall be determined at the boundary of the nearest ground floor noise sensitive premises or 1 meter from the facade of the nearest first floor (or higher) noise sensitive premises, and in accordance to the latest British Standard 4142; An alternative position for assessment /measurement may be used to allow ease of access, this must be shown on a map and noise propagation calculations detailed to show how the design criteria is achieved. \r\nb) The units shall be isolated on adequate proprietary anti-vibration mounts to prevent the structural transmission of vibration and regenerated noise within adjacent or adjoining premises, and these shall be so maintained for the entirety of their use.    \r\nc) Following installation of the units to which the application refers, a post completion noise assessment shall be submitted for approval to the local planning authority which demonstrates the actual measured rating level of the units operating under normal conditions. All measurements shall be made in accordance with the methodology of BS4142: 2014 (Methods for rating and assessing industrial and commercial sound) and/or its subsequent amendments. The post completion report shall be both completed and submitted to the local authority within 28 days of completion of the installation for review, and prior to actual use.",
