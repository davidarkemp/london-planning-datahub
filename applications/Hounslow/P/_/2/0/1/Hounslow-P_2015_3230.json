    "Condition : 1 - It is considered that the erection of a single storey rear extension by reason of its excessive depth would cause harm to neighbours living conditions through a loss of light and overshadowing and creating a sense of enclosure along the boundary, the depth of the extension would be out of keeping with the character of the host dwelling and the surrounding area. The proposal is therefore contrary to Local Plan Policies CC1 (Context and Character), CC2 (Urban design and architecture) and SC7 (Residential Extensions) and the Residential Extension Guidelines SPG"
