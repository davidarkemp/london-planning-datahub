    "Condition : 1 - The proposed advertisement panel mesh, by reason of size, scale and design would be visually intrusive from the surrounding areas and would be overly dominant at the frontage of the site and from within the Great West Road corridor. The proposal is considered to adversely impact on the amenity of the surrounding environment. Accordingly, the proposal is considered to be contrary to advice in PPG 19 and Policies ENV-B.1.1, ENV-B.1.4, and ENV-N 1.16 of the Council's adopted Unitary Development Plan, Brentford Area Action Plan Policy 4 and London Plan policies.  The development would also be contrary to the Emerging Local Policy CC5."
