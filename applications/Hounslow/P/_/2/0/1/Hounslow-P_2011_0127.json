    "Condition : 1 - 1.\tThe retention of the internally illuminated advertisement, by reason of location and the excessive size and scale, would adversely impact on the appearance of the surrounding environment. The advert appears out of place in the environment due to the removal of other large-scale advert hoardings, and the improvements that have occurred in the quality and appearance of the surrounding environment. The proposal is considered contrary to PPG19 Outdoor Advertisements, the Town and Country (Control Of Advertisements) Regulations 2007, and Policies ENV B.1.1 (New Development), and ENV B.1.4 (Advertisements) within the Adopted 2003 Unitary Development Plan and Policies BAAP2 (Urban Design) and BAAP 4 (The Great West Road) of the Brentford Area Action Plan."
