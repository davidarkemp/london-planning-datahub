    "Condition : 1 - The proposed extension is not felt to be secondary to the proportions of the original house and would not relate well to the site and the scale, nature, massing and character of the adjacent townscape. Consequently, the proposed development would be contrary to the objectives of Policies ENV-B.1.1 and H.6.4, those of supplementary planning guidance in the form of the Residential Extension Guidelines and emerging Local Plan policies CC1, CC2 and SC7.",
    "Condition : 2 - In light of the above, the development is not considered to minimise its impact to the neighbouring property and would be considered detrimental to living conditions at the neighbouring property to the south. This would be contrary to the objectives of Policy ENV-B.1.1 of the UDP and the intentions of supplementary planning guidance in the form of the Residential Extension Guidelines."
