The proposed extension would also cause harm to neighbours living conditions by way of loss of outlook and daylight. The development would fail to comply with London Borough of Hounslow Local Plan policies CC1 Context and Character, CC2 Urban Design and Architecture, CC4 Heritage and SC7 Residential extensions and alterations."
