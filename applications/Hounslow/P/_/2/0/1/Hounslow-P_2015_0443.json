The assessment should show that a reduction in CO2 emissions of at least 25% will be achieved, taken from a CO2 emissions baseline calculated using the mandatory minimums outlined in the Part L Building Regulations. CO2 emissions figures should be calculated using SAP (Standard Assessment Procedure)/ SBEM (Simplified Building Energy Model) and the associated worksheets should be submitted as part of the application, alongside full details, and, where appropriate, plans and technical schematics of the proposed energy efficiency measures and renewable energy technology(ies).",
