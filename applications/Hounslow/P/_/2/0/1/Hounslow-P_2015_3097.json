    "Condition : 1 - It is considered that the erection of a detached single storey outbuilding to be used as a gym at the rear of the house, by reason of its excessive height, footprint, lack of set ins and inappropirate location of wndows would cause harm to neighbours living conditions through a loss of outlook and privacy, would result in an unacceptable loss of amenity space on site and would be overbearing and appear as an obtrusive feature in the rear garden causing harm to the character of the surrounding area. The proposal is contrary to Unitary Development Plan policies ENV-B.1.1 (New Developments), H.6.4 (Extensions and Alterations) and Emerging Local Plan policies CC1 (Context and Character), CC2 (Urban design and architecture), SC7 (Residential Extensions), the Residential Extension Guidelines SPG and the 1997 Supplementary Planning Guidance."
