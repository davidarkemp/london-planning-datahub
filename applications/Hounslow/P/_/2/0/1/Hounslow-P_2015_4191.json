    "Condition : 1 - The extension, due to its inappropriate design combined with its excessive size and scale, appears as a visually intrusive and incongruous form of development which is to the detriment of the character and appearance of the property itself and the area and has resulted in an unacceptable loss of outlook and sense of enclosure for the occupiers of neighbouring properties. Accordingly, the development is contrary to adopted Local Plan policies CC1 (Context and Character), CC2 (Urban Design and Architecture), SC7 (Residential Extensions) and the SPG 'Residential Extension Guidelines'"
