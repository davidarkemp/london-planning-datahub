    "Condition : 1 - The proposed rear roof extension would fail to preserve or enhance the character and appearance of Gunnersbury Park Conservation Area due to its proposed bulk and scale, which would result on a dominant addition to the property.  The insertion of two front rooflights would further detract from the established and uniform appearance of the streetscene and the Conservation Area, contrary to the provisions of policies CC1, CC2 and CC4 of the Local Plan and Section 5.0 and 8.0 of the Residential Extension Guidelines."
