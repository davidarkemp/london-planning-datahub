    "Condition : 1 - 1. The proposed first floor rear extension, as a result of its position, size and scale would result in an overbearing addition, harming the appearance and character of the area and neighbours' living conditions through loss of outlook, light, overshadowing and an unacceptable sense of enclosure, and as such the proposal would be contrary to adopted Unitary Development Plan policies ENV-B.1.1 (New Development), and H.6.4 (Extensions and Alterations) and the intent of the Residential Extension Guidelines.\r\n\r\n2. The proposed first floor rear extension would unacceptably affect the rear profile of this terrace. The extension would not be in keeping with the character of the area and would be an incongruous feature on an otherwise uniform terrace and is thus contrary to adopted Unitary Development Plan policies ENV-B.1.1 (New Development), and H.6.4 (Extensions and Alterations) and the intent of the Residential Extension Guidelines."
