The samples and details shall include:\r\n\r\nbrickwork; \r\ncladding materials (where relevant);\r\nwindow treatment (including sections and reveals); \r\nobscure glazing details (where relevant); and  \r\nany other materials to be used.\r\n\t\r\nThe development shall be carried out strictly in accordance with the details so approved and maintained as such thereafter.",
    "Condition : 3 - The proposed development shall be carried out in all respects in accordance with the proposals contained in the application and the plans submitted (1596/93, 1596/94, 1596/95, 1596/96, 1596/97, 1596/98, 1596/99 Received 07/04/2015) therewith and approved by the Local Planning Authority, or as shall have been otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority before the building is used.",
    "Condition : 4 - Notwithstanding the provisions of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development Order) 2015 (or any order revoking or re-enacting that order) no enlargement of the premises or any additional structures/buildings within the curtilage of the site shall be carried out.",
    "Condition : 5 - Notwithstanding the provisions of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 2015 (or any order revoking and re-enacting that Order with or without modification), no windows/dormer windows shall be constructed.",
    "Condition : 6 - Prior to commencement of any above ground works on site, full details of all proposed landscaping, cycle storage and boundary treatments shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority. The details shall be completed prior to occupation of the dwelling and retained thereafter.",
    "Condition : 7 - The building shall not be occupied until a means of pedestrian and vehicular access has been constructed in accordance with the approved plans.",
    "Condition : 8 - Before the dwelling hereby approved is first occupied, the developer shall provide to the dwelling a green box container and any other type of containers required at the time of development for household use for the storage and collection of recyclable materials for the purposes of the Council's kerbside recycling service, to the specification then in use by the local authority's recycling collection service (or to such other specification as shall first be submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority) and shall notify the Council's refuse and recycling services when the development is first occupied.  The house shall also be supplied with a garden waste-composting bin of at least 220 litres capacity at the same time.",
    "Condition : 9 - The car parking accommodation shown on the approved plans shall be provided before the dwelling to which it relates is occupied and thereafter it shall not be used for any purpose other than the parking of vehicles.",
    "Condition : 10 - No demolition or construction work shall take place on the site except between the hours of 8:00am  to 6:00pm on Mondays to Friday and 9:00am to 1:00pm on Saturdays and none shall take place on Sundays and Public Holidays without the prior agreement of the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Condition : 11 - During construction works an appropriate wheel-washing system shall be provided to remove mud, stones and any other extraneous materials from the wheels and chassis' of construction vehicles exiting the site and all loads of construction materials, excavation spoil or other such matter shall be fully covered in order to ensure that no material leaves the site attached to the vehicle which might subsequently be deposited on the highway. The exit from the wheel washing system shall be constructed from a hard, non-porous surfacing material and sited as far away from the exit to the highway as is possible given the constraints of the site and the surface shall be kept clean at all times. Waste water discharged from the wheel washing system shall be stored and disposed of on site and shall not be discharged into the public sewerage system without prior removal of soil, stones and any other suspended material. Suitable measures to minimise dust nuisance caused by the operations and to ensure that no dust or other debris is carried on to the adjoining properties shall also be provided in accordance with the Greater London Authority's \"Air Quality\" guidance, and site lighting shall be designed, positioned and directed so as not to unnecessarily intrude on passing drivers on public highways and so as not to direct light into any windows of properties outside the site. \r\nAll construction vehicles must park/ load/ unload/ pick up/ drop off away from the TLRN public highway of A4 Great West Road. No skip/ construction materials shall be kept on the footway/ carriageway of A4 Great West Road at any time. The footway and carriageway on A4 Great West Road must not be blocked during the construction and maintenance of the proposal. Temporary obstruction during the construction must be kept to a minimum and should not encroach on the clear space needed to provide safe passage for pedestrian, or obstruct the flow of traffic on the TLRN."
