    "Condition : 1 - The development hereby permitted shall be begun before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.",
    "Condition : 2 - The proposed development shall be carried out in all respects in accordance with the proposals contained in the application and the plans submitted ( SR/R0404/01 (received on 08 July 2019); and SR/R0404/02 Rev. A (received on 05 November 2019) ) therewith and approved by the Local Planning Authority, or as shall have been otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority before the building is used.",
    "Condition : 3 - No development shall take place until samples of the materials to be used in the construction of the external surfaces hereby permitted have been submitted and approved in writing by the local planning authority. Development shall therein be carried out in accordance with the approved details.",
    "Condition : 4 - Prior to commencement of groundworks (excluding site investigations and demolition), the applicant must submit a final detailed drainage design including drawings and supporting calculations and updated Drainage Assessment Form to the Lead Local Flood Authority for review and approval, aligned with the Drainage Assessment form 15/09/19. A detailed management plan confirming routine maintenance tasks for all drainage components must also be submitted to demonstrate how the drainage system is to be maintained for the lifetime of the development. Confirmation of the sewerage undertaker's agreement of connection to sewer network must also be provided to ensure that there is capacity in the network and a point for connection.",
    "Condition : 5 - No building hereby permitted shall be occupied until evidence (photographs and installation contracts) is submitted to demonstrate that the sustainable drainage scheme for the site has been completed in accordance with the submitted details. The sustainable drainage scheme shall be managed and maintained thereafter in accordance with the agreed management and maintenance plan for all of the proposed drainage components.",
    "Condition : 6 - The development shall not commence until an Energy Statement has been submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority.  The Statement shall have regard to the principles in London Plan Policies 5.2 and 5.3 and the Mayor of London's SPG for Sustainable Design and Construction, setting out measures to improve the sustainability and energy efficiency of the building, and the development shall not thereafter be occupied until the strategy has been fully implemented in accordance with the approved Strategy.",
    "Condition : 7 - Prior to first occupation of the building(s) evidence (e.g. photographs, installation contracts and As-Built certificates under the Standard Assessment Procedure should be submitted to the Local Planning Authority and approved in writing to show that the development has been constructed in accordance with the approved Energy Strategy, and any subsequent approved revisions.",
    "Condition : 8 - All developments are required to meet the following sustainable materials standards and shall not be occupied until evidence (e.g. photographs and copies of delivery notes, invoices or installation contracts) have been submitted to the Local Planning Authority to demonstrate that the development meets the following:\r\n\"\tAt least three of the key elements of the building envelope (external walls, windows roof, upper floor slabs, internal walls, floor finishes/coverings) are to achieve a rating of A+ to D in the Building Research Establishment (BRE) The Green Guide of specification.\r\n\"\tAt least 50% of timber and timber products are to be sourced from accredited Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) or Programme for the Endorsement of Forestry Certification (PEFC) scheme.\r\n\"\tNo construction or insulation materials are to be used which will release toxins into the internal and external environment, including those that deplete stratospheric ozone.\r\n",
    "Condition : 9 - Prior to first occupation of the building(s) evidence (schedule of fittings and manufactures literature) should be submitted to the Local Planning Authority and approved in writing to show that the development has achieved an internal water use of 105L/person/day or less.",
    "Condition : 10 - No development (except any demolition, site clearance, ground investigation and remediation work) shall take place until details of cycle parking have been submitted to and approved by the Local Planning Authority. At least two cycle spaces need to be provided for the house to accord with the London Plan standards. The spaces must be secure, sheltered, easily accessible, and conveniently located. Further guidance on appropriate dimensions, layouts, and stands is available in the West London Cycle Parking Guidance. The location of the bins would obstruct access to the cycle and prevent cycles being wheeled past (the West London Cycle Parking Guidance advises that a person wheeling a bicycle requires a width of at least 1.1m).",
    "Condition : 11 - No development (except any demolition, site clearance, ground investigation and remediation work) shall take place until details of the arrangements for the storing of waste and recycled materials [(including details of how the placing of waste and recycled materials in a suitable location for collection would be undertaken and managed)] has been submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority. The development shall not be carried out otherwise than in accordance with the approved details.",
    "Condition : 12 - No additional windows or other glazed openings shall be formed in the side walls of the extension hereby approved and no additional doors inserted in the building without the prior written consent of the Local Planning Authority."
