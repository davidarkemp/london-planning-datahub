    "Condition : 1 - The proposed front extension, by virtue of its design and prominent location would constitute an unsympathetic form of development that would dominate the site detracting from the character and appearance of the host property and surrounding area. The proposal would therefore be contrary to policies CC1 and CC2 of the adopted Local Plan.",
    "Condition : 2 - Due to insufficient internal floorspace, the absence of external amenity space and a poor internal arrangement the proposed scheme would result in a sub-standard form of accommodation. The proposal would therefore be contrary to policy SC5 of the adopted Local Plan and the Mayor of London's Housing SPG."
