    "Condition : 1 - The proposed roof extension, by reason of its size, scale and design would result in an unacceptable level of harm to the character and appearance of the dwelling, streetscene, failing to preserve or enhance the parent dwelling or surrounding area. The proposal is contrary to adopted Local Plan Policies CC1 (Context and Character), CC2 (Urban Design and Architecture), and SC7 (Residential Extensions and Alterations) and the intent of the Residential Extension Guidelines.",
    "Condition : 2 - Given the scale, mass and design, the proposal would result in harm to the neighbour's living conditions through loss of outlook and light, creation of an unacceptable sense of enclosure and an overbearing presence. It is therefore not considered to comply with adopted Local Plan policies CC1 (Context and Character), CC2 (Urban Design and Architecture and SC7 (Residential Extensions and Alterations) and the intent of the Residential Extension Guidelines."
