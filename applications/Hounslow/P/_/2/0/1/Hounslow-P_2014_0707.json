    "Condition : 1 - The proposal would be an overdevelopment of the site resulting in a cramped and crowded layout that would be out of character with the locality and would have a detrimental effect on the symmetry of this section of Beech Road.  The proposal is therefore contrary to adopted Unitary Development Plan policies ENV-B.1.1 (New Development), B.2.2 (Conservation Areas) and H.4.1 (Housing Standards and Guidelines), and Supplementary Planning Guidance (1997).",
    "Condition : 2 - The proposal would have an unacceptable impact on highway safety and efficiency by reason of an insufficient off street car parking provision.  This is contrary to UDP policies ENV-B.1.1 (New development), 4.3 (Traffic implications of new development) and T.4.4 (Road safety)."
