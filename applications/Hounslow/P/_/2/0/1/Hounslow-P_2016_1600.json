    "Condition : 1 - The first floor rear extension, by virtue of its scale and proximity to the boundary of the property in combination with existing additions would appear overbearing and intrusive when viewed from neighbouring plots and would result in an unacceptable level of enclosure to amenity space. The proposal would therefore be contrary to policies CC2 and SC7 of the Councils adopted Local Plan and the Councils Residential Extension Guidelines."
