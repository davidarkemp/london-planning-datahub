    "Condition : 1 - The application would result in the loss of an A1 retail unit to a shopping parade within a neighbourhood centre and would undermine the retail function of the shopping parade within a neighbourhood centre. It would therefore fail to comply with the intent of policies CC1(Context and Character), TC1 (Town and Neighbourhood Centre Network) and TC5 (Managing neighbourhood centres and isolated local shops ) of the Local Plan.",
    "Condition : 2 - The application fails to demonstrate that the proposed  change of use would not result in harm to living conditions of neighbours, to the character and appearance of the area or to highways safety. It would therefore fail to comply with the intent of policies CC1(Context and Character) and EC2 (Developing a sustainable local transport network) of the Local Plan."
