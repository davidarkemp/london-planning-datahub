    "Condition : 1 - 1.\tThe proposed high level advert panels and associated structure, by virtue of size, position, design and appearance would have an unacceptable impact on the amenity of the area. The size and scale of the adverts and structure would have an overbearing impact on pedestrians and cyclists at A4 level and would adversely impact on the amenity of the residential properties to the west. The height of the structure is excessive and would adversely impact on the amenity of the surrounding environment and the Great West Road corridor.  The structure is therefore contrary Planning Policy Guidance 19, Circular 03/2007 and policies ENV-B.1.1 (New Development) and ENV-B.1.4 (Advertisements) of the Unitary Development Plan and Policies BAAP2 (Urban Design) and BAAP 4 (The Great West Road) of the Brentford Area Action Plan.",
    "Condition : 2 - 2.\tThe proposed high level advert panels and associated structure and 96 sheet panel, by virtue of size, position, design and appearance would have an unacceptable impact on the amenity of the area and would adversely impact on the regeneration of the Great West Road corridor. The appearance of the road corridor has significantly improved over the last four years, with redevelopment of vacant sites. Advertising of this nature is no longer appropriate or acceptable, and would not be for a temporary nature in screening a development site. The structure is therefore contrary Planning Policy Guidance 19, Circular 03/2007 and policies ENV-B.1.1 (New Development) and ENV-B.1.4 (Advertisements) of the Unitary Development Plan and Policies BAAP1 (Sustainable Development), BAAP2 (Urban Design) and BAAP 4 (The Great West Road) of the Brentford Area Action Plan.",
    "Condition : 3 - 3.\tThe proposed advert panels and structure, represent a potential distraction to motorists on a carriageway where caution is required, which would be detrimental to road safety conditions on the road, and would adversely impact on public safety in accordance with the Town & Country Planning (Control of Advertisement) Regulations 2007, Circular 03/2007, Planning Policy Guidance 19 and would also be contrary to Policies ENV-B.1.1 (New Development), ENV-B.1.4 (Advertisements) and T.4.4 (Road Safety) of the Council's adopted Unitary Development Plan and Brentford Area Action Plan Policy 4.",
    "Condition : 4 - 4.\tThe proposed LED advert panels and structure, represent a potential distraction to motorists on a carriageway where caution is required. The frequency of changes of display, or method of change has not been specified in the application and as a result the LED screens are considered to potentially distract motorists on the elevation M4 motorway. Accordingly, the proposal fails to have due regard for public safety in accordance with the Town & Country Planning (Control of Advertisement) Regulations 2007, Circular 03/2007, Planning Policy Guidance 19 and would also be contrary to Policies ENV-B.1.1 (New Development), ENV-B.1.4 (Advertisements) and T.4.4 (Road Safety) of the Council's adopted Unitary Development Plan and Brentford Area Action Plan Policy 4."
