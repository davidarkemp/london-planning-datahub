    "Condition : 1 - The development through its inappropriate size and positioning would not preserve the architectural and historic significance of the listed building, nor the character and appearance of the  Bedford Park Conservation Area. It has not been demonstrated that the solar panel will produce more energy than other renewable energy sources, or that it cannot be situated elsewhere in the site. Therefore the proposed development does not comply with policies ENV-B.2.7 (Alterations to Listed Buildings and Buildings of Local Townscape Character), ENV-B.1.1 (New Development) and ENV-B.2.2 (Conservation Areas) of the London Borough of Hounslow Unitary Development Plan 2003."
