The exit from the wheel washing system shall be constructed from a hard, non-porous surfacing material and sited as far away from the exit to the highway as is possible given the constraints of the site and the surface shall be kept clean at all times. Waste water discharged from the wheel washing system shall be stored and disposed of on site and shall not be discharged into the public sewerage system without prior removal of soil, stones and any other suspended material. Suitable measures to minimise dust nuisance caused by the operations and to ensure that no dust or other debris is carried on to the adjoining properties shall also be provided in accordance with the Greater London Authority's \"Air Quality\" guidance, and site lighting shall be designed, positioned and directed so as not to unnecessarily intrude on passing drivers on public highways and so as not to direct light into any windows of properties outside the site. Start of works on site shall be notified to the Council's Community Environment Team.",
    "Condition : 8 - Before the dwellings hereby approved are first occupied, the developer shall provide a secure covered cycle parking store in the location shown on the approved plans for not less than two bicycles.
