    "Condition : 3 - The A3 Restaurant/Cafe hereby approved shall not be open to customers outside the following times 09.30 to 21.30 Monday to Sunday and during Public Holidays.",
    "Condition : 4 - a) The cumulative measured or calculated rating level of noise emitted from the mechanical services plant hereby approved including heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) to which the application refers, shall be 10dB(A) below the existing background noise level at all times and shall not increase the background noise level by more than 2 dB(A)L90 (dB(A)L90 (dB(A)) (5 minute measurement period) and there shall be no increase in any one-third octave band between 50 Hertz and 160 Hertz.  The measured or calculated noise levels shall be determined at the boundary of the nearest ground floor noise sensitive premises or one metre from the facade of the nearest first floor (or higher) noise sensitive premises, including the flats above the premises to which this permission relates and in accordance to the latest British Standard 4142.  The applicant shall commission a professional and suitably qualified noise consultant to assess this performance and the consultant shall carry out tests to verify and certify this and the applicant shall submit a copy of this report to the local planning authority before the ventilation plant is brought into permanent use.  It shall be maintained in such a manner that it shall perform to the measured standard or better and shall be retained as such permanently. \r\nb) The plant shall be isolated on adequate proprietary anti-vibration mounts to prevent the structural transmission of vibration and regenerated noise within adjacent or adjoining premises, and these shall be so maintained thereafter.",
    "Condition : 5 - The extract ventilation system specified in the application shall be provided, within three months of the date of this decision. The kitchen extract system shall include the following details and be permanently maintained to this specification:\r\na) \tA three-stage filtration system, including grease filters, pre-carbon filters and carbon filters, to be located inside the building.\r\nb)\tThe point of discharge shall be a minimum of one metre above eaves level or one metre above openable windows of nearby properties.\r\nc) \tThe ducting shall be circular.\r\nd) \tThe ventilation duct shall terminate pointing directly upwards and shall not be fitted with a cowl. \r\ne) \tThe exterior of the ducting and the associated mounting shall be finished in a black or dark grey powder coated finish.",
    "Condition : 6 - Delivery and collection times (including refuse) for commercial premises situated adjacent to residential properties shall only be carried out between the following hours:  Monday to Saturday 07:00 and 22:00, Sunday 09:00 to 20:00.",
    "Condition : 7 - Within three months of the date of this permission a secure storage area within the rear service yard of No. 108 High Street (as indicated by Location Plan drawing DM/108/2019B) enclosed by a two metre high close boarded fence to house not less than two 1100 litre galvanised steel Eurobins shall be made available, together with facilities for the separation and safe storage of glass, metal, plastics, cardboard, food waste and other recyclable materials which shall then be collected and taken to a suitable facility for recycling.  The storage area and bins shall be made permanently available before the development is first occupied and no waste shall be stored outside the site including on public highways or footways.  The lids of the Eurobins shall be fixed shut at all times other than when waste is being emptied into them.  Non-recyclable and perishable waste shall be removed from site no less frequently than once a week.  Waste shall be removed from the site to a suitable enclosed private storage area or an authorised refuse disposal or recycling site as soon as the bins become full if this is earlier than the time of the normal collection, unless additional covered and enclosed bins (as described above) have been provided and are thereafter made permanently available for the on-site storage of refuse and waste."
