    "Condition : 1 - The proposed erection of a rear roof extension including hip to gable conversion and three roof lights to front elevation would by, reason of their excessive size, bulk, inappropriate design and position would be an overbearing and visually obtrusive feature that would be out of keeping with the existing property and surrounding area. The proposal is therefore contrary to Local Plan Policies CC1 (Context and Character), CC2 (Urban design and architecture) and SC7 (Residential Extension) and the Residential Extension Guidelines SPG."
