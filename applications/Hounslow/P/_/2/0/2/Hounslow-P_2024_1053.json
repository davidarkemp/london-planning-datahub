    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development, due its size, scale and positioning, would result in an increased sense of enclosure, overbearingness, and a loss of outlook that would harm the living conditions of neighbouring properties. The proposed development would therefore be contrary to Local Plan Policies CC2 (Urban Design and Architecture) and SC7 (Residential Extensions and Alterations) and the intent of the Residential Extension Guidelines.",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed development by reason of its size, scale, and design would fail to reflect the proportions of the host dwelling and would not appear subservient. It would be an incongruous addition which would harm the character and appearance of the host property and wider area, contrary to Local Plan Policies CC1 (Context and Character), CC2 (Urban Design and Architecture), and SC7 (Residential Extensions and Alterations) and the intent of the Residential Extension Guidelines."
