  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed extensions, by virtue of their scale and design would result in a bulky, obtrusive and incongruous addition that would be harmful to the character and appearance of the area,  contrary to adopted Local Plan Policies CC1 (Context and Character) and CC2 (Urban Design and Architecture).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposal does not demonstrate that the environmental performance of the building has been maximised. The proposal is therefore contrary to London Plan policies SI2 (Minimising greenhouse gas emissions), SI3 (Energy infrastructure) and SI4 (Managing heat risk) and Local Plan policies EQ1 (Energy and carbon reduction) and EQ2 (Sustainable design and construction).",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposal, by reason of lack of amenity space, noise impacts and poor outlook for some of the units, would result in inadequate living conditions for future occupiers of this development. The proposal is therefore contrary to London Plan policies D4 (Delivering good design), D5 (Inclusive Design) and D6 (Housing quality and standards) and Local Plan policies SC3 (Meeting the need for a mix of housing size and type), SC4 (Scale and density of new housing development) and SC5 (Ensuring suitable internal and external space).",
    "Reason : 4 - It has not been demonstrated that the introduction of further noise sensitive uses in close proximity to commercial businesses would not compromise functioning and viability of those businesses. In the absence of information demonstrating such, the proposal is contrary to the aims and objectives of London Plan Policy D13 and Policy EQ5 of the adopted Local Plan.",
    "Reason : 5 - The proposal by virtue of its design would result in a bulky, obtrusive and incongruous addition harm the living conditions of the adjoining and existing neighbours above 487 Staines Road, through a loss of outlook and increased sense of enclosure. Thus making it contrary to adopted Local Plan Policies CC1 (Context and Character) and CC2 (Urban Design and Architecture)."
