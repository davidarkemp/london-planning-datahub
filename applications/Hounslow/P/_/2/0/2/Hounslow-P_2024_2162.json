The submitted plan shall include details of:\r\n\r\n- Management of any flat/shallow pitched/green roofs on buildings within the\r\nsite which may be attractive to nesting, roosting and \"loafing\" birds.\r\n\r\n- If the grass around the pond is to be kept short, then then a barrier should be established around the pond itself. The barrier can be a fence or dense continuous planting.\r\n\r\nOr\r\n\r\n- If the grass around the pond is be managed as long meadow or another habitat that does not provide suitable grazing, then a barrier around the seating areas is necessary. The barrier can be a fence or dense continuous planting.\r\n\r\nThe Bird Hazard Management Plan shall be implemented as approved and shall remain in force for the life of the buildings. No subsequent alterations to the plan are to take place unless first submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority.\r\n\r\nReason: It is necessary to manage the flat roofs and the site to minimise its attractiveness to birds which could endanger the safe movement of aircraft and the operation of Heathrow Airport.\r\n\r\nInformation: The Bird Hazard Management Plan must ensure that flat/shallow pitched roofs be constructed to allow access to all areas by foot using permanent fixed access stairs ladders or similar. The owner/occupier must not allow gulls, to nest, roost or loaf on the building. Checks must be made weekly or sooner if bird activity dictates, during the breeding season. Outside of the breeding season gull activity must be monitored and the roof checked regularly to ensure that gulls do not utilise the roof. Any gulls found nesting, roosting or loafing must be dispersed by the owner/occupier when detected or when requested by Heathrow Airside Operations staff. In some instances, it may be necessary to contact Heathrow Airside Operations staff before bird dispersal takes p",
