    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development by reason of its inappropriate size and scale would result in an increased sense of enclosure and overbearingness that would harm the living conditions of neighbouring properties, contrary to Local Plan Policies CC2 (Urban Design and Architecture) and SC7 (Residential Extensions and Alterations) and the intent of the Residential Extension Guidelines.",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposal would be an incongruous addition, which when combined with the existing extension would dominate the rear elevation of the host property and would fail to appear subservient. It would harm the character and appearance of the host property and conservation wider area, contrary to Local Plan Policies CC1 (Context and Character), CC2 (Urban Design and Architecture), CC4 (Heritage) and SC7 (Residential Extensions and Alterations), and the intent of the Residential Extension Guidelines."
