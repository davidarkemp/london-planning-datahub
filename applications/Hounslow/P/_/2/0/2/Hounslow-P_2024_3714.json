    "Reason : 1 - The application fails to demonstrate that it would meet identified local need and no evidence has been provided to demonstrate that nomination arrangements have been agreed with the Council. The application is therefore contrary to Local Plan policy SC8.\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The application fails to demonstrate how the proposal would avoid adverse impact on the amenity of neighbouring residents due to the increased comings and goings leading to greater noise, disturbances, or parking stress within the neighbourhood. It is therefore contrary to Local Plan policies CC2 and EQ5.",
    "Reason : 3 - The application fails to demonstrate that the proposal would provide a suitable standard of accommodation for the end use and service user, contrary to Local Plan policies SC5 and SC8. ",
    "Reason : 4 - The proposal does not make adequate arrangements for refuse and recycling or cycle parking and fails to demonstrate that it would not result in increased parking stress or prejudice highway safety, contrary to London Plan policies T6 and Local Plan policies EC2 and EQ7.",
    "Reason : 5 - In the absence of a legal agreement, the development fails to secure a nomination agreement agreed with the Council to maximise the utilisation for local residents, and to ensure against the importation of need from outside the Borough, and any necessary monitoring fees and planning services fees. The development would therefore be contrary to adopted Local Plan Policy SC8 and IMP3."
