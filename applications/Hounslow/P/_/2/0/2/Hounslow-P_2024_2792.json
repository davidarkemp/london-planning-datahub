    "Reason : 1 - The proposed single storey rear extension and rear roof extension, due to their excessive size and scale, would result in bulky and incongruous additions to the main house, harmful to the character and appearance of the site and surrounding area, contrary to Local Plan Policies CC1 (Context and Character), CC2 (Urban Design and Architecture) and SC7 (Residential Extensions and Alterations) and the intent of the Residential Extension Guidelines.",
    "Reason : 2 - The property would be not suitable for conversion, as the site would not located within 400 metres of a town centre or in an area with good access to public transportation and does not have an internal floor area of 130 sq metres as built. The proposal is therefore unacceptable in principle, contrary to Local Plan policy SC10 (Housing In Multiple Occupation, Hostels and Bed & Breakfast Accommodation) and the Houses in Multiple Occupation SPG.",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposal has failed to demonstrate that the proposal would not result in loss increased disturbance to residents of neighbouring properties contrary to Local Plan policy SC10 (Housing In Multiple Occupation, Hostels and Bed & Breakfast Accommodation) and the Houses in Multiple Occupation SPG.",
    "Reason : 4 - The proposal has failed to demonstrate a good standard of accommodation for future occupiers with regards to outdoor amenity space. The proposal is therefore contrary to Local Plan policies SC5 and SC10 and the Houses in Multiple Occupation SPD.",
    "Reason : 5 - The proposal has failed to demonstrate that there is sufficient capacity on the local road network to accommodate the additional demand for vehicles, contrary to Local Plan policy EC2 and the Houses in Multiple Occupation SPD. ",
    "Reason : 6 - The proposal has failed to demonstrate that the proposed conversion proposals together with other similar development in the surrounding area will not have a serious harmful cumulative impact on the character and residential amenity of the area. As such, the proposal is therefore unacceptable in principle, contrary to Local Plan Policy SC10 (Housing In Multiple Occupation, Hostels and Bed & Breakfast Accommodation) and the Houses in Multiple Occupation SPG."
