    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development, by virtue of its scale and siting, would result in an obtrusive addition to the main house, and cause harm to the character and visual appearance of the site and surrounding area.  Given its siting and scale, the proposed would diminish the architectural coherence of this house, and thereby harm the appearance and character of the site and the surrounding area. It would therefore run contrary to Local Plan policies CC1, CC2, SC7 and the intent of the Residential Extension Guidelines SPD",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposal, by virtue of its siting and excessive footprint, is considered to harm the living conditions of adjoining property, No.16, by reasons of loss of light, overshadowing and increased sense of enclosure. Overall, the scheme would run contrary to Local Plan policies CC2, SC7 and the intent of the Residential Extension Guidelines SPD"
