    "Condition : 1 - The developer must notify the local planning authority of the completion of the development as soon as is reasonably practicable after completion, which must be in writing and must include: (i) the name of the developer; (ii) the address or location of the development, and (iii) the date of completion.\r\n\r\nWhere the enlarged part of the dwellinghouse has more than a single storey, the roof pitch of the enlarged part must, so far as practicable, be the same as the roof pitch of the original dwellinghouse.\r\n\r\nThe materials used on the external surfaces of the development shall match those used in the building to which it is attached in terms of style, colour, texture and, in the case of brickwork, bonding, coursing and pointing (other than materials used in the construction of a conservatory).\r\n\r\nAny window located in a wall or roof slope forming a side elevation of the dwellinghouse must be: (a) obscure-glazed; and (b) non-opening unless the parts of the window which can be opened are more than 1.7 metres above the floor of the room in which the window is installed. Any such windows shall, once installed, be retained permanently as such, and once built no further side windows shall be installed. \r\n\r\nReason: In order to protect neighbours' living conditions and the appearance of the area."
