    "Condition : 3 - The floodlighting columns hereby permitted shall not be operated outside the hours of 07:00am to 10:00pm. They shall be functional and directional and shall be designed in line with current guidance (BCT and ILP, 2018; Stone, E.L. (2013), avoiding excessive up-lighting and light spill beyond the boundaries of the pitch.",
    "Condition : 4 - 4.\tPrior to first use of the development, a completed community use agreement prepared in consultation with Sport England shall have been submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority. The agreement shall apply to sport facilities and ancillary provision and include details of pricing policy, hours of use, access by non-educational establishment users, management responsibilities and a mechanism for review. The development shall not be used otherwise than in strict compliance with the approved agreement.",
    "Condition : 5 - The cricket nets hereby permitted shall be designed and constructed in accordance with ECB TS6 Guidance and maintained in compliance with this guidance (as amended) for as long as the nets remain in existence.",
    "Condition : 6 - Prior to first use of the development, evidence shall be submitted for approval in writing by the Local Planning Authority to show that emergence/re-entry surveys have been undertaken which are in accordance with the BCT guidance for low and moderate value structures and trees, to confirm the presence/likely absence of roosting bats; measures to avoid and/or mitigate impacts on bats shall be implemented in full before the development is first brought into use. Examples of mitigation measures for bats may include provision of new roost sites i.e. bat boxes (this is likely to be required before demolition or tree works if an existing roost is to be removed), measures to prevent disturbance to roosts during construction, habitat enhancements and specifications for lighting to ensure there is no change to light levels impacting the river and bat corridors etc.",
    "Condition : 7 - Prior to first use of the development, full details of at least three bird and three bat nesting boxes shall have been submitted to the Local Planning Authority for approval in writing, in accordance with the following specifications:\r\n\"\tThree bat boxes, installed on suitable trees at the site at a minimum height of 3 metres, facing in a southerly direction, in an unlit location, and with connectivity to suitable habitats. \r\n\"\tThree starling 'Stumus vulgaris' nest boxes, installed within the wider sports ground site, placed at a minimum height of 3 metres, facing in a southerly direction, in an unlit location and with connectivity to suitable habitats.\r\nThe nesting boxes shall be installed strictly in accordance with the details so approved, and shall be maintained as such thereafter.",
    "Condition : 8 - All removal of trees, hedgerows, shrubs, scrub or tall herbaceous vegetation, or clearance of any potential bird nesting habitats, shall be undertaken between September and February inclusive. If this is not possible then a suitably qualified ecologist shall check the areas concerned immediately prior to the clearance works to ensure that no nesting or nest-building birds are present. If any nesting birds are present then the vegetation shall not be removed until the fledglings have left the nest."
