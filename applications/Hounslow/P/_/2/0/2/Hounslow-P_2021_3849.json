    "Condition : 3 - Mechanical Services Noise Control \r\na) The cumulative measured or calculated rating level of noise emitted from the mechanical services plant including heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) to which the application refers, shall be 10dB(A) below the existing background noise level, at all times that the mechanical system etc operates. The measured or calculated noise levels shall be determined at the boundary of the nearest ground floor noise sensitive premises or 1 meter from the facade of the nearest first floor (or higher) noise sensitive premises, and in accordance to the latest British Standard 4142; An alternative position for assessment /measurement may be used to allow ease of access, this must be shown on a map and noise propagation calculations detailed to show how the design criteria is achieved. \r\nb) The plant shall be isolated on adequate proprietary anti-vibration mounts to prevent the structural transmission of vibration and regenerated noise within adjacent or adjoining premises, and these shall be so maintained thereafter. \r\nc) Following installation of any mechanical services plant including heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) to which the application refers, a post completion noise assessment shall be submitted for approval to the local planning authority which demonstrates the actual measured rating level of plant operating under normal conditions. All measurements shall be made in accordance with the methodology of BS4142: 2014 (Methods for rating and assessing industrial and commercial sound) and/or its subsequent amendments. The post completion report shall be both completed and submitted to the local authority within 28 days of completion of the installation for review. \r\n",
    "Condition : 4 - Before this ventilation system is first brought into use, unless other arrangements are first submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority,  a secure storage area shall be created adjacent to the rear of the building enclosed by a two-metre high close boarded fence to house not less than two 1100-litre galvanised steel Eurobins shall be made available, together with facilities for the separation and safe storage of glass, metal, plastics, cardboard, food waste and other recyclable materials which shall then be collected and taken to a suitable facility for recycling.  The storage area and bins shall be made permanently available and no waste shall be stored outside the site including on public highways or footways.  The lids of the Eurobins shall be fixed shut at all times other than when waste is being emptied into them.  Non-recyclable and perishable waste shall be removed from site no less frequently than once a week.  Waste shall be removed from the site to a suitable enclosed private storage area or an authorised refuse disposal or recycling site as soon as the bins become full if this is earlier than the time of the normal collection, unless additional covered and enclosed bins (as described above) have been provided and are thereafter made permanently available for the on-site storage of refuse and waste."
