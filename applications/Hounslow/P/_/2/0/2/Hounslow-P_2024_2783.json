    "Reason : 1 - On 16th August 2024, the proposal measuring 42.8m3 as shown on the drawings: OS-01, PL-01, EX-01 ï¿½ received 16th August 2024 was not lawful because: \r\n\r\nThe development fails to comply with the terms of Class B of Part 1 of Schedule 2 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended) because the proposed dormer would extend across the boundary line encroaching onto the roof slope of the neighbouring property, and thus beyond the outside face of an external wall of the dwellinghouse (i.e. outside its curtilage)."
