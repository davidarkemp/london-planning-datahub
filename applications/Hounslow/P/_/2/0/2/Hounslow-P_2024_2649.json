    "Reason : 1 - The proposed change of use of the house (Class C3) to a small House in Multiple Occupation (Class C4) would be unacceptable by reason of its unsustainable and inappropriate location outside of and further than 500 metres from a designated town centre boundary and poor accessibility by walking, cycling and public transport, contrary to Local Plan Policies SC10 and EC2 and the Houses in Multiple Occupation SPD.  ",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposal, due to the poor access to public transport and failure to demonstrate that vehicle trip generation of occupiers and available parking provision in the area and the proposals impact, would be contrary to policy T6 of London Plan and policy EC2 of the Local Plan and the Houses in Multiple Occupation SPD.
