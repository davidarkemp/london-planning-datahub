    "Reason : 1 - The proposed extension by reason of its inappropriate positioning, would result in overshadowing and increased sense of enclosure for neighbouring properties. The proposed development would therefore harm neighbouring living conditions and would be contrary to Local Plan policies CC2 and SC7 and the Character, Sustainability and Design Codes SPD � Part A5 Residential Extension Guidelines.  ",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed extension by reason of its excessive depth in relation to the size of the rear garden would fail to remain subservient to the main house and would be an overbearing an visually obtrusive feature harming the character of the main house and surrounding area contrary to Local Plan Policies CC1, CC2 and SC7 and the Character, Sustainability and Design Codes SPD � Part A5 Residential Extension Guidelines. ",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed extension would results in an unacceptable loss of amenity space harming the living conditions of existing and future occupiers of the site. This would be contrary to Local Plan Policy SC7 (Residential Extensions and Alterations). "
