    "Reason : 2 - The proposed second floor balcony with timber trellis, by reason of its position, size, design and appearance, would have a serious and adverse effect on the amenities enjoyed by adjoining residents, by reason of unacceptable sense of enclosure, loss of privacy and overbearing appearance, contrary to Local Plan policies CC1; CC2; SC7, and the intent of the National Planning Policy Framework."
