    "Reason : 1 - Given its improper design, excessive size and lack of sufficient setbacks, it is considered that the proposed development would result in an obtrusive development which would fail to remain subservient to the main house, and cause harm to its character and visual appearance, and that of the existing streetscene and surrounding area. This would be contrary to policies CC1 (Context and Character), SC7 (Residential Extensions and Alterations) of the adopted Local Plan (2015) and the intentions of the adopted Residential Extension Guidelines SPD. ",
    "Reason : 2 - The applicant has failed to demonstrate that no excessive harm would be expected to the living conditions of its neighbour at No.45 Swan Road. The proposal would therefore not comply with adopted Local Plan Policy CC2 (Urban Design and Architecture), SC7 (Residential Extensions and Alterations) of the adopted Local Plan (2015) and the intentions of the adopted Residential Extension Guidelines SPD.",
    "Reason : 3 - The submitted scheme has failed to demonstrate adequate and safe parking provision, and thus considered harmful to pedestrian and highway safety. The proposal would therefore not comply with adopted Local Plan Policy EC2 (Developing a sustainable local transport network), London Plan T6.1 and the Council's Residential Crossovers and Off-Street Parking Policy."
