  "description": "Works to trees in a Conservation Area-(T6) Common Lime  Crown thin by approximately 25%. Final height and spread will be unchanged. (T12) Horse Chestnut to reduce 3 lowest limbs  by 2 - 3 metres - cutting back to suitable side growth and retaining a natural appearance, leaving a crown radius of 4 - 4.75 metres from the outside edge of trunk and a maximum pruning cut diameter of 22 cm). Lightly reduce limb above to balance if necessary. Final height will be unchanged and final spread will 8 meters. (T15) Common Lime reduce back to most recent reduction points - ensuring that all regrowth is carefully removed so as to ensure minimum damage to swollen reduction / pollard heads. Final height 14 meters and final spread  6 meters. ( T17) Common Lime -crown reduce to an approximate height of 14 - 15 metres - rebalancing laterals to form a smaller crown of as near to a natural form as possible. Final spread  6 meters. (T18) Weeping Willow repollard and  all regrowth is removed, the final height 5 meters and final spread 5 meters. (T29) Hybrid Oak reduce by pruning to the previous reduction points. Removing approximately 2-3 meters of new growth. Final height 18 meters and final spread 14 meters.",
