    "Reason : 1 - The proposal would appear as an overly dominant addition that would fail to relate subordinately to the main dwelling resulting in harm to the character and appearance of the local area contrary to Local Plan policies CC1, CC2 and SC7 as well as the guidance contained within the Residential Extension Guidelines SPD.",
    "Reason : 2 - Due to its excessive depth and height along the shared boundary the single storey rear extension would result in a loss of outlook for neighbouring occupiers contrary to Local Plan policies CC1, CC2 and SC7 of the Residential Extension Guidelines SPD."
