    "Condition : 15 - Before the development hereby permitted commences:\r\n(a)\tDetails of an intrusive site investigation are required in addition to the phase 1 desk study previously submitted. These details shall be submitted to, and approved in writing by, the Local Planning Authority. The site shall be investigated by a competent person to identify the extent and nature of contamination. The report should include a tiered risk assessment of the contamination based on the proposed end use of the site. Additional investigation may be required where it is deemed necessary.\r\n(b)\tIf required, a scheme for decontamination of the site shall be submitted to the Local Planning Authority, for written approval. The scheme shall account for any comments made by the Local Planning Authority before the development hereby permitted is first occupied.\r\nDuring the course of the development:\r\n(c)\tThe Local Planning Authority shall be notified immediately if additional contamination is discovered during the course of the development. A competent person shall assess the additional contamination, and shall submit appropriate amendments to the scheme for decontamination in writing to the Local Planning Authority for approval before any work on that aspect of development continues. \r\nBefore the development is first brought into use:\r\n(d)\tThe agreed scheme for decontamination referred to in clauses b) and c) above, including amendments, shall be fully implemented and a written validation (closure) report submitted to the Local Planning Authority for approval. \r\n",
    "Condition : 16 - Notwithstanding the details on the approved plans, prior to commencement of groundworks (excluding site investigations and demolition), the applicant shall have submitted to the Local Planning Authority for approval in writing a final detailed drainage design, including drawings and supporting calculations [and an updated Drainage Assessment Form] to be reviewed and approved by the Lead Local Flood Authority. The drainage hierarchy shall make use of green infrastructure technology or evidence that is not possible to comply with the hierarchy set out in London Plan Policy SI3 and the runoff rate should not exceed 1.4 litres/second. A detailed management plan confirming routine maintenance tasks for all drainage components shall also be submitted and approved which demonstrates how the drainage system is to be maintained for the lifetime of the development. The development shall be carried out in strict compliance with the approved details.",
    "Condition : 17 - No part of the development hereby permitted shall be occupied until evidence (photographs and copies of installation contracts, along with a written confirmation) has been submitted to the Local Planning Authority and approved in writing to demonstrate that the sustainable drainage scheme hereby approved has been completed in accordance with the submitted final detailed drainage designs. The sustainable drainage scheme shall be managed and maintained thereafter in accordance with the agreed management and maintenance plan for all of the proposed drainage components.",
    "Condition : 18 - a) The cumulative measured or calculated rating level of noise emitted from the mechanical services plant including heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) to which the application refers, shall be 10dB(A) below the existing background noise level, at all times that the mechanical system etc operates. The measured or calculated noise levels shall be determined at the boundary of the nearest ground floor noise sensitive premises or 1 meter from the facade of the nearest first floor (or higher) noise sensitive premises, and in accordance to the latest British Standard 4142; An alternative position for assessment /measurement may be used to allow ease of access, this must be shown on a map and noise propagation calculations detailed to show how the design criteria is achieved.\r\n\r\nb) The plant shall be isolated on adequate proprietary anti-vibration mounts to prevent the structural transmission of vibration and regenerated noise within adjacent or adjoining premises, and these shall be so maintained thereafter.\r\n\r\nc) Following installation of any mechanical services plant including heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) to which the application refers, a post completion noise assessment shall be submitted for approval to the local planning authority which demonstrates the actual measured rating level of plant operating under normal conditions. All measurements shall be made in accordance with the methodology of BS4142: 2014(Methods for rating and assessing industrial and commercial sound) and/or its subsequent amendments. The post completion report shall be both completed and submitted to the local authority within 28 days of completion of the installation for review.",
    "Condition : 19 - Prior to occupation, the development shall achieve 'Secured by Design' accreditation awarded by the Design-Out Crime Officer from the Metropolitan Police Service on behalf of the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO).\r\n\r\nNo part of the dwelling shall be occupied until accreditation has been achieved and evidence of such accreditation has been submitted to the Local Planning Authority."
