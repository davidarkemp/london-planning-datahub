Therefore, the proposed development would be contrary to Local Plan Policies CC2 (Urban Design and Architecture) and SC7 (Residential Extensions and Alterations) and the intent of the Residential Extension Guidelines.",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposal by virtue of its inappropriate design, position and appearance would fail to be a sympathetic addition and would result in an incongruous addition to the host property. The proposed development would therefore harm the character and appearance of the host property and wider Osterley Park Conservation Area, contrary to Local Plan Policies CC1 (Context and Character), CC2 (Urban Design and Architecture), CC4 (Heritage) and SC7 (Residential Extensions and Alterations) and the intent of the Residential Extension Guidelines."
