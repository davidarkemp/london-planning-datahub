The mitigation must then be carried out in accordance with the approved details. The development shall not include biomass boilers.",
    "Condition : 15 - (A). No development shall take place until a scheme of acoustic insulation and any other necessary means of ventilation is provided for that Block is submitted to and approved by the Local Planning Authority. Such a scheme shall include details of measures to ensure internal ambient noise levels within residential accommodation do not exceed the limits contained in BS8233:2014. Any works that form part of such a scheme shall be completed as approved before the development is first occupied.\r\n\r\n(B). Prior to the occupation of the development, commissioning testing of internal ambient noise levels at a representative sample of dwellings should be undertaken demonstrating compliance with the scheme approved under Part A of this condition. Details of the noise testing shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority.",
