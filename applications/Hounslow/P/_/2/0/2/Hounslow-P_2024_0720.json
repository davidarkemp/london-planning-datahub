    "Reason : 1 - 1.\tThe single storey rear extension, by reason of its inappropriate size, scale and positioning, results in overshadowing, an increased sense of enclosure and loss of outlook to neighbouring properties. The development therefore causes harm to neighbours' living conditions and would be contrary to Local Plan Policies, CC2 (Urban Design and Architecture) and SC7 (Residential Extensions and Alterations) and the intent of the Residential Extension Guidelines.",
    "Reason : 2 - 2.\tThe proposed single storey rear extension and front porch, by reason of their inappropriate size, scale, position and design, would fail to reflect to the proportions of the main house and result in bulky and incongruous additions. The proposed development would therefore harm the character and appearance of the host property and wider area, contrary to Local Plan Policies CC1 (Context and Character), CC2 (Urban Design and Architecture) and SC7 (Residential Extensions and Alterations) and the intent of the Residential Extension Guidelines."
