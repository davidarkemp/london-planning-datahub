    "Condition : 1 - The development hereby permitted shall begin not later than three years from the date of this decision.",
    "Condition : 2 - The development hereby permitted shall be carried out in accordance with the following approved plans and specifications:01 Rev A, 300 Rev A, 304 Rev A, 305 Rev A, 312 Rev A, 313 Rev A, 314 Rev A, 315 Rev A, 316 Rev A, Planning, Heritage and Transport Statement, Design & Access Statement, Internal Daylight Assessment, Supporting Letter (dated 19 October 2022), Transport Statement received 9 February 2023; 301 Rev A, 302 Rev A, 303 Rev A, Noise Impact Assessment received 28 February 2023; Staffing Numbers, Marketing Report received 31 March 2023; TP/TR/01 received 6 April 2023; 310 Rev D, 311 Rev C received 20 April 2023.",
    "Condition : 3 - The materials to be used in the construction of the external surfaces of the development hereby permitted shall match those used in the existing building, unless otherwise shown on the approved plans.",
    "Condition : 4 - The use and/or development hereby approved shall operate at all times  to meet the following standards:\r\n(i)  \tNoise from any plant or machinery shall not exceed 5dB(A) below the existing background noise level when measured at the boundary of the nearest noise-sensitive property;\r\n(ii)  \tThe ventilation flue discharge point shall be not less than one metre above the highest ridge of the building to which it is attached. (note - Local circumstances, e.g. nearby tall buildings or the proximity of openable windows may dictate that a higher discharge point is necessary to achieve effective dilution and dispersion of cooking odours in the exhausted air and you are advised to contact the Council about this where you think this may be the case);\r\nThe termination of the flue shall be plain, with airflow unobstructed by a cowl or rain deflector to maximise the dilution and dispersion of cooking odours.\r\n(iii) \tAir extracted from the food cooking air must pass through a filtration system. In addition, simple grease traps and activated carbon filters (or some other approved odour removal technology) shall be incorporated into the design to minimise the likelihood of cooking odours being present in the exhausted air.;\r\n(iv)  \tFlexible couplings and anti-vibration mountings shall be used on all surface mounted plans that generates noise or vibrations to prevent the transmission of noise and vibration into any adjoining property.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
    "Condition : 5 - Either side of the vehicle access hereby approved, visibility splay areas (the depth measured from the back of the footway and the widths outwards from the edges of the access, with a splay of at least 2.4 metres x 2.4 metres) shall be provided before the access and parking area is brought into use.  These areas shall be kept clear of any obstructions to visibility greater than 600 mm in height, including shrubs, planting, boundary walls, fences, gates, other means of enclosure or other structures or objects at all times.",
    "Condition : 6 - Notwithstanding any details included in the submitted plans, no part of the development shall first be occupied until details of both hard and soft landscape works have been submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority. These details shall include \r\n(a)\ta statement setting out the design objectives and how these will be delivered; \r\n(b)\tmeans of enclosure/boundary treatment(s) and retaining structures;\r\n(c)\tvehicle parking layouts; \r\n(d)\tother vehicle and pedestrian access and circulation areas;\r\n(e)\thard surfacing materials; \r\n(f)\tplanting plans, written specifications (including cultivation and other operations associated with plant and grass establishment); schedules of plants, noting species, plant sizes and proposed numbers and densities where appropriate; and\r\n(g)\tan implementation programme (including phasing of work where relevant).\r\nThe landscaping works shall comply with the requirements specified in BS 3936 (1992) 'Specification of Nursery Stock Part 1 Trees and Shrubs', and in BS 4428 (1989) 'Recommendations for General Landscape Operations', and shall be carried out in accordance with the approved details before the development hereby permitted is first occupied or brought into use, or such other date(s) as may be specified in the agreed implementation programme.\r\n",
    "Condition : 7 - Prior to the first use or occupation of the development full details (including manufacturers' specifications) of secure covered cycle parking facilities that accord with the West London Cycle Parking Guidance for not less than 5 long-stay  spaces and 2 short-stay spaces for the occupants of, and visitors to, the development shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority. The approved facilities shall be fully implemented and made available for use before the development is first occupied or brought into use, The approved facilities shall be thereafter retained for use at all times without obstruction.",
    "Condition : 8 - Before the development hereby permitted is first occupied or brought into use, a Car Parking Management Plan shall first be submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority. The development shall not be carried out otherwise than in accordance with the approved details and shall be maintained for the lifetime of the development, unless the prior written approval of the local planning authority is obtained to secure any variation.",
    "Condition : 9 - Before the development hereby permitted is first occupied or brought into use full details of the arrangements for the storing of waste and recycled materials (including details of how the placing of waste and recycled materials in a suitable location for collection would be undertaken and managed) shall been submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority. The development shall not be carried out otherwise than in accordance with the approved details.",
    "Condition : 10 - Before the development hereby permitted is first occupied or brought into use, the Local Planning Authority shall be informed of the agreed naming and numbering of the proposed dwellings so that arrangements can be put in place to ensure that, with the exception of a person eligible for a disabled person's badge issued pursuant to section 21 of the Chronically Sick and Disabled Persons Act 1970 (or similar legislation), no resident of the development shall obtain a resident's parking permit. Any occupiers of the approved development shall surrender any such permit wrongly issued or held."
