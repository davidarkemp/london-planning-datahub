    "Reason : 1 - Given its improper design and excessive size, it is considered that the proposed development would result in an obtrusive development which would fail to remain subservient to the main house, and cause harm to its character and visual appearance, and that of the existing streetscene and surrounding area. This would be contrary to policies CC1 (Context and Character), SC7 (Residential Extensions and Alterations) of the adopted Local Plan (2015) and the intentions of the adopted Residential Extension Guidelines SPD. ",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed single storey rear extension, on account of its excessive size, siting and existing site constraints within the neighbouring property, would result in excessive harm to the living conditions of its neighbour at 48 Beaver's Crescent by loss of light, outlook and increased sense of enclosure and overbearing. This would be contrary to Local Plan policies CC2 (Urban Design and Architecture), SC7 (Residential Extensions and Alterations) and the intentions of the adopted Residential Extension Guidelines SPD.
