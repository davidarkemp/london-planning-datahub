  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposal, by reason of the additional noise, disturbance and general levels of activity generated by the development and use, would result in unacceptable harm to neighbouring residents' living conditions, contrary to Local Plan Policies CC1, EQ5 and the intent of the National Planning Policy Framework.",
    "Reason : 2 - The applicant has failed to submit any information to demonstrate that the kitchen extract system & extension structure would not result in unacceptable air quality or noise disturbance to nearby residents and no details as to the refuse and recycling arrangements have been provided. This would be contrary to Local Plan Policies CC1, EQ4, EQ5 and EQ7, and the intent of the National Planning Policy Framework.",
    "Reason : 3 - The application fails to provide any supporting documentation regarding deliveries and servicing arrangements to demonstrate that the development would not cause significant harm to highway safety contrary to London Plan Policy T4 and Local Plan Policies EQ7 and EC2.",
    "Reason : 4 - The current external finish is wholly unacceptable and given the ambiguity in the application submission, noting that it is retrospective, it has to be concluded that, in terms of design, the retrospective application to retain the structure is harmful to the character and appearance of the area, the property itself and is not in compliance with policies CC1 (Context and Character) and CC2 (Urban Design and Architecture) of the adopted Local Plan"
