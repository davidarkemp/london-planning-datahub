    "Reason : 1 - The proposals by virtue of their size and scale would represent bulky, obtrusive and incongruous additions which would harm the character and appearance of the host property and wider area. The proposed reduction to the garden area would result in inadequate living conditions for future residents.

    "Reason : 2 - In the absence of a drainage strategy, the proposal has failed to demonstrate that the increase in impermeable area would not be to the detriment of the surface water and drainage conditions in the area, noting the proximity to the Longford River.  In the absence of such, the proposal therefore contrary to Local Plan Policy EQ3"
