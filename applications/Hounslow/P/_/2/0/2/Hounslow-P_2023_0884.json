In addition, simple grease traps and activated carbon filters (or some other approved odour removal technology) shall be incorporated into the design to minimise the likelihood of cooking odours being present in the exhausted air;\r\n(iv)  \tFlexible couplings and anti-vibration mountings shall be used on all surface mounted plans that generates noise or vibrations to prevent the transmission of noise and vibration into any adjoining property.\r\n"
