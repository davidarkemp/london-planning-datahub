    "Reason : 1 - The proposal fails to ensure the transport impacts of the development are adequately addressed, as the car-free proposal for the two new flats would not be acceptable due to the poor PTAL of the application site, the development would result in an over-provision of parking the remaining office use on the site, appropriate and safe access to the site from the public highway cannot be secured as the redline boundary does not extend to the public highway as it does not include the alley which connects the site to Church Street, and the proposal fails to provide adequate provision for cycle parking and waste and recycling facilities within the redline boundary of the application site. The proposal would therefore be contrary to the terms of Schedule 2, Part 3, Class MA, Paragraph MA.2 (2)(a) of the Town and County Planning (General Permitted Development)(England) Order (2015)(as amended).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed development has failed to demonstrate that the proposed habitable rooms of the dwellinghouses would have access to an adequate provision of natural light, as no daylight/sunlight report has been submitted with the application. The proposal would therefore be contrary to the terms of Schedule 2, Part 3, Class MA, Paragraph MA.2 (2)(f) of the Town and County Planning (General Permitted Development)(England) Order (2015)(as amended)."
