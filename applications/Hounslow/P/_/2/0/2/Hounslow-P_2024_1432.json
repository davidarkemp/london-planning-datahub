  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The property has an original net internal floor area of less than 130 square metres and fails to retain a family sized unit on the ground floor.  As such, the proposal fails to comply with Local Plan policy SC6 and is considered unsuitable for conversion in principle; resulting in harm to the residential amenity and character of the area from over-intensification of the site and loss of a small family dwelling",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposal fails to provide sufficient amenity space for flat 2 to the detriment of the living conditions of future occupiers, and is therefore contrary to Local Plan Policy SC5",
    "Reason : 3 - As a result of the excessive scale and uncharacteristic design of the proposed roof extension and size of the rear extension, the development would be a visually intrusive, bulky and disproportionate extension that significantly harms the appearance of the house and street which therefore fails to comply with adopted Local Plan Policies CC1, CC2, SC7 and the Residential Extension Guidelines",
    "Reason : 4 - The development has failed to demonstrate that the proposal would not have an adverse impact upon on-street parking conditions to the detriment of highway and pedestrian safety, which is contrary to Local Plan Policy EC2"
