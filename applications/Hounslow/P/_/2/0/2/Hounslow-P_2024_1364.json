    "Reason : 1 - Due to the inclusion primary living facilities and the scale of the development, the proposal would fail to relate incidentally or subordinately to the main dwelling appearing as an overly dominant addition resulting in harm to the character and appearance of the local area contrary to Local Plan policies CC1, CC2 and SC7 as well as the guidance contained within the Residential Extension Guidelines SPD",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposal would represent an overbearing addition in close proximity to the rear gardens of neighbouring properties resulting in a unneighbourly sense of enclosure and increased levels of noise and disturbance to neighbouring occupiers contrary to Local Plan policies CC1, CC2 and SC7 as well as the guidance contained within the Residential Extension Guidelines SPD"
