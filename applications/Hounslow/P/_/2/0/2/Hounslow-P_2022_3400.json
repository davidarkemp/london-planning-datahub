    "Condition : 15 - Street Name and Numbering\r\nBefore the development hereby permitted is first occupied or brought into use, the Local Planning Authority shall be informed of the agreed naming and numbering of the proposed dwellings so that arrangements can be put in place to ensure that, with the exception of a person eligible for a disabled person's badge issued pursuant to section 21 of the Chronically Sick and Disabled Persons Act 1970 (or similar legislation), no resident of the development shall obtain a resident's parking permit. Any occupiers of the approved development shall surrender any such permit wrongly issued or held.\r\n",
    "Condition : 16 - Highways Works\r\nPrior to the commencement of the development hereby approved, full details of the highways works, including the removed vehicular access and alterations to the footpath must be submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority. The development shall be carried out in strict compliance with the approved details. \r\n",
    "Condition : 17 - Flood Risk Assessment\r\nThe development hereby permitted shall be carried out in line with flood management measures as shown in the submitted and hereby approved Flood Risk Assessment, dated: 05/10/2020, received: 23/11/2022.\r\n",
    "Condition : 18 - Waste and Recycling Store\r\nThe approved refuse and recycling store as shown on approved plan no. [210830-1300-P02] shall be completed and made available for use before the development hereby permitted is first occupied or brought into use, and thereafter shall be retained for such use at all times without obstruction. Bins shall be stored within the store at all times and shall not be left on the public highway.\r\n",
    "Condition : 19 - Tree Planting\r\n(a)\tNo development (except any demolition, site clearance, ground investigation and remediation work) shall take place until a full specification of all proposed tree planting has been submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority. The specification shall include the quantity, size, species, and positions or density of all trees to be planted, how they will be planted and protected and the proposed times of planting. \r\n(b)\tAll trees shall be planted in accordance with the details and times stated in the approved specification and in accordance with British Standard 8545:2014 (or an equivalent British Standard if replaced).\r\n(c)\tAny trees that, within five years of planting, die, are cut down, uprooted, destroyed or become (in the opinion of the Local Planning Authority) seriously damaged or diseased, shall be replaced with another tree of a similar size and species within the first planting season following its death, removal, uprooting or destruction.\r\n",
    "Condition : 20 - Noise Control \r\na) The cumulative measured or calculated rating level of noise emitted from the air source heat pumps to which this permission refers, shall be 10dB(A) below the existing background noise level, at all times that the plant operate. The measured or calculated noise levels shall be determined at the boundary of the nearest ground floor noise sensitive premises or one metre from the facade of the nearest first floor (or higher) noise sensitive premises, and in accordance to the latest British Standard 4142. An alternative position for assessment/measurement may be used to allow ease of access, this must be shown on a map and noise propagation calculations detailed to show how the design criteria are achieved. \r\n\r\nb) The plant shall be isolated on adequate proprietary anti-vibration mounts to prevent the structural transmission of vibration and regenerated noise within adjacent or adjoining premises, and these shall be so maintained thereafter.   \r\n\r\nc) Following installation of the air source heat pumps to which the application refers, a post completion noise assessment shall be submitted for approval to the local planning authority which demonstrates the actual measured rating level of plant operating under normal conditions. All measurements shall be made in accordance with the methodology of BS4142: 2014 (Methods for rating and assessing industrial and commercial sound) and/or its subsequent amendments. The post completion report shall be both completed and submitted to the local authority within 28 days of completion of the installation for review. If the plant fails to meet the specified standard, remedial measures shall be put in place immediately and the noise assessment shall be carried out again.  This shall be repeated until the assessment has reached the required standard.  Once achieved, the plant shall be maintained permanently thereafter to continue to meet the standard.\r\n"
