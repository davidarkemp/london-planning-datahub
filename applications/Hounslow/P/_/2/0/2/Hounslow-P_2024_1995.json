    "Reason : 1 - The proposal by virtue of its scale and relationship with the non-adjoining neighbour, 210 Cranford Lane would result in a visually intrusive and overly dominant form of development which would adversely affect outlook for the occupiers of that neighbour dwelling. Thus making it contrary to adopted Local Plan Policies CC2 (Urban Design and Architecture),) and SC7 (Residential Extensions and Alterations) and the intent of the Supplementary Planning Document Residential Extensions Guidelines.",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposal by virtue of the scale and design would result in bulky, obtrusive and incongruous additions which would harm the character and appearance of the host property and wider area. Thus making it contrary to adopted Local Plan Policies CC1 (Context and Character), CC2 (Urban Design and Architecture),) and SC7 (Residential Extensions and Alterations) and the intent of the Supplementary Planning Document Residential Extensions Guidelines."
