The measured or calculated noise levels shall be determined at the boundary of the nearest ground floor noise sensitive premises or one meter from the facade of the nearest first floor (or higher) noise sensitive premises, and in accordance with BS4142:2014+A1:2019. An alternative position for assessment/ measurement may be used to allow ease of access, this must be shown on a map and noise propagation calculations detailed to show how the design criteria is achieved.  These noise control requirements shall be complied with by permanently accommodating the mechanical services plant hereby approved in appropriate and effective noise insulated housing.  \r\n\r\nb) The plant shall be isolated on adequate proprietary anti-vibration mounts to prevent the structural transmission of vibration and regenerated noise within adjacent or adjoining premises, and these shall be so maintained thereafter.  \r\n\r\nc) Following installation of the mechanical services plant, including air source heat pumps, hereby approved, a post completion noise assessment shall be submitted for approval to the Local Planning Authority which demonstrates the actual measured rating level of plant operating under normal conditions. All measurements shall be made in accordance with the methodology of BS4142:2014+A1:2019 and/or its subsequent amendments.
