    "Reason : 1 - The proposal, by reason of the introduction of fully self-contained residential accommodation within the rear garden represents an inappropriate form of development, contrary and harmful to the prevailing pattern of development in the area which fails to comply with Local Plan Policy CC1 (Context and Character), CC2 (Urban Design and Architecture) and SC1 (Housing Growth).   ",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposal, by reason of the introduction of residential accommodation in the location and of the scale proposed, would result in an increased level of activity, noise and disturbance and loss of privacy to neighbouring properties, resulting in significant harm to the neighbours living conditions, contrary to Local Plan Policy CC2 (Urban Design and Architecture) and Policy SC1 (Housing Growth).",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposal, due to its excessive scale and design fails to respond to the character and context of the surrounding area. The proposal is therefore contrary to the intentions of the Local Plan policies CC1 (Context and Character), CC2 (Urban Design and Architecture) and SC4 (Scale and density of new housing development).",
    "Reason : 4 - The proposed accommodation would have poor outlook for future residents, resulting in inadequate living conditions for future occupiers of this development. The proposal is therefore contrary to Local Plan policies SC1 (Housing Growth) and SC4 (Scale and density of new housing development).",
    "Reason : 5 - The proposal does not demonstrate that the environmental performance of the building has been considered or maximised as required. The proposal is therefore contrary to London Plan policies SI2 (Minimising greenhouse gas emissions), SI3 (Energy infrastructure) and SI4 (Managing heat risk) and Local Plan policies EQ1 (Energy and carbon reduction) and EQ2 (Sustainable design and construction). \r\n"
