    "Reason : 1 - The proposed front porch, due to the inappropriate design and excessive size and scale, would result in a bulky and incongruous addition to the main house, which would harm the character and appearance of the site and surrounding area, contrary to Local Plan policy CC1, CC2, SC7 and Part A5 of the Hounslow Character, Sustainability, and Design Codes SPD.",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposal would harm the free flow and safety of pedestrians and vehicles on the local highway network and it would fail to provide the minimum depth for perpendicular parking spaces in front of the property, fail to include a 1.2-meter-wide clear pedestrian path from the street to the front door of the property, fail to provide the minimum 1.2 meters wide pedestrian refuge point between the crossover located at 19 Wheatley Road, fail to prevent excessive car parking, contrary to adopted Local Plan policy EC2, Hounslow Character, Sustainability, and Design Codes SPD, and the Residential Crossovers and Off-Street Parking Policy.",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposal would fail to provide any soft landscaping and would introduce inappropriately designed and incongruous boundary treatment which would harm the character of the surrounding area, contrary to Local Plan policy SC7 and GB7 and Part A5 of the Hounslow Character, Sustainability, and Design Codes SPD and the Council's Residential Crossover and Off-Street Parking policy."
