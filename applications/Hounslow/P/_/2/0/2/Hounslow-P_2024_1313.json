    "Reason : 1 - The proposal for a restaurant, bakery and hot food takeaway use is considered unacceptable in principle in this location and would be contrary to London Plan policy EC9 (Retail, markets and hot food takeaways) and Local Plan policy TC3 (Managing the growth of retail and other main town centre uses).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposal, by reason of its inappropriate use in a residential area and lack of mitigation measure, would lead to significant noise disturbance and would severely impact the local community and surrounding area contrary to Local Plan policies CC2 (Context and Character), EQ4 (Air Quality) and EQ5 (Noise). ",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposal, by reason of its inappropriate design, bulk and position would be an overbearing and visually incongruous form of development which would have an unacceptable impact on the character of the host dwelling and surrounding area contrary to Local Plan policy CC1 (Context and character), CC2 (Urban design and architecture), SC7 (Residential extensions and alterations) and the Council's adopted Residential Extension Guidelines. ",
    "Reason : 4 - The proposal has failed to demonstrate that the development would not adversely impact highway safety and that waste management can be adequately accommodated within the site contrary to Local Plan policies EQ7 (Sustainable waste management) and EC2 (Developing a sustainable local transport network).
