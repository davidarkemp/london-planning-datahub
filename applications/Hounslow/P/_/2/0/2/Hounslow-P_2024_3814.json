    "Condition : 1 - The development hereby permitted shall begin not later than three years from the date of this decision.\r\nReason: In order to comply with Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990, as amended by Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004.",
    "Condition : 2 - The development hereby permitted shall be carried out in accordance with the following approved plans and specifications: [Unnumbered Cover Letter, Unnumbered Kitchen Extract Brochure, Unnumbered Kitchen Extract Multi Filtration Unit Brochure, Unnumbered Fire Strategy, A310, Unnumbered Cassette Brochure, 001-1293-ES, 001-1293-201, 001-1293-202, 001-1293-221, 001-1293-222, Unnumbered Site Location Plan, 001-1293-01, 001-1293-02, 001-1293-21, 001-1293-22, Odour Assessment, Plant Noise Impact Assessment].\r\nReason: In order to ensure the development is carried out in accordance with the planning permission.",
    "Condition : 3 - a) The cumulative measured or calculated rating level of noise emitted from the mechanical services plant including heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) to which this permission refers, shall be 10dB(A) below the existing background noise level, at all times that the plant operates. The measured or calculated noise levels shall be determined at the boundary of the nearest ground floor noise sensitive premises or one metre from the facade of the nearest first floor (or higher) noise sensitive premises, and in accordance with the latest British Standard 4142. An alternative position for assessment/measurement may be used to allow ease of access, this must be shown on a map and noise propagation calculations detailed to show how the design criteria are achieved. \r\n\r\nb) The plant shall be isolated on adequate proprietary anti-vibration mounts to prevent the structural transmission of vibration and regenerated noise within adjacent or adjoining premises, and these shall be so maintained thereafter. \r\n\r\nc) Following installation of any mechanical services plant including heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) to which the application refers, a post completion noise assessment shall be submitted for approval to the local planning authority which demonstrates the actual measured rating level of plant operating under normal conditions. All measurements shall be made in accordance with the methodology of BS4142: 2014 (Methods for rating and assessing industrial and commercial sound) and/or its subsequent amendments. The post completion report shall be both completed and submitted to the local authority within 28 days of completion of the installation for review. If the plant fails to meet the specified standard, remedial measures shall be put in place immediately and the noise assessment shall be carried out again. This shall be repeated until the assessment has reached the required standard. Once achieved, the plant shall be maintained permanently the",
    "Condition : 4 - The use and/or development hereby approved shall operate at all times to meet the following standards: \r\n\r\n(i) The ventilation flue discharge point shall be not less than one metre above the highest ridge of the building to which it is attached and shall be installed entirely as detailed in the technical drawing, Titled: 'Proposed HVAC layout Ground Floor' (Drawing No: 001-1293-01). The termination of the flue shall be plain, with airflow unobstructed by a cowl or rain deflector to maximise the dilution and dispersion of cooking odours. \r\n\r\n(ii) Air extracted from the food cooking air shall pass through the proposed filtration system detailed in the 'Chapman Ventilation Report', dated 19/12/2024; Ref: \"Odour assessment for proposed Popeyes Hounslow\", and be compliant with EMAQ+ Control of Odour and Noise from Commercial Kitchen Exhaust Systems 05-9-2018 at all times.\r\n\r\n(iii) Cleaning, Servicing and Maintenance of the kitchen extraction system shall be carried out in accordance with the 'Maintenance' section of the 'Chapman Ventilation Report', dated 19/12/2024; Ref: \"Odour assessment for proposed Popeyes Hounslow\".\r\n\r\n(iv) Flexible couplings and anti-vibration mountings shall be used on all surface mounted plans that generates noise or vibrations to prevent the transmission of noise and vibration into any adjoining property. \r\nReason: In order to protect neighbours' living conditions.
