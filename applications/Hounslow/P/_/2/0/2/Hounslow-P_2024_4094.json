    "Condition : 1 - The development hereby permitted shall begin not later than three years from the date of this decision.\r\n\r\nReason: In order to comply with Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990, as amended by Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004.",
    "Condition : 2 - The development hereby permitted shall be carried out in accordance with the following approved plans and specifications: [insert plan numbers/documents].\r\nReason: In order to ensure the development is carried out in accordance with the planning permission.",
    "Condition : 3 - The materials to be used in the construction of the external surfaces of the development hereby permitted shall match those used in the existing building, unless otherwise shown on the approved plans.\r\nReason: In order to safeguard the appearance of the area.",
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed side extension would project forward of the principal elevation to sit flush with a projecting bay window. As such the proposal would appear as an overly dominant form of development that would fail to relate subordinately to the main dwelling contrary to Local Plan policies CC1, CC2 and SC7 as well as the guidance contained within the Hounslow Character, Sustainability and Design Codes SPD."
