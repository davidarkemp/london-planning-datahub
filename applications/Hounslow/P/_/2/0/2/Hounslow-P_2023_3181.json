    "Condition : 1 - The proposed hip to gable conversion would not reflect the appearance and proportions of the original pair of semi-detached properties. In addition, the proposed rear roof extension would fail to reflect the portions of the original roof. It would fail to appear subservient and would be an incongruous addition which would dominate the rear roof slope of the host property. The proposed extension would harm the character and appearance of the host property and wider street scene within Harewood Road. The proposal is therefore contrary to Local Plan Policies CC1 (Context and Character), CC2 (Urban Design and Architecture) and SC7 (Residential Extensions and Alterations; the intent of the Residential Extension Guidelines and the principles of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023)."
