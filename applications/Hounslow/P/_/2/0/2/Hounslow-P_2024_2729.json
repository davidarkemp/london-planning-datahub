    "Reason : 1 - Given its improper design, excessive size and lack of sufficient setbacks, it is considered that the proposed development would result in an incongruous and obtrusive development which would fail to remain subservient to the main house, and cause harm to its character and visual appearance, and that of the existing streetscene and surrounding area. This would be contrary to policies CC1 (Context and Character), SC7 (Residential Extensions and Alterations) of the adopted Local Plan (2015) and the intentions of the adopted Residential Extension Guidelines SPD.
