A competent person shall assess the additional contamination, and shall submit appropriate amendments to the scheme for decontamination in writing to the Local Planning Authority for approval before any work on that aspect of development continues. \r\nBefore the development is first brought into use:\r\nC.\tAny necessary scheme for decontamination required by either clauses B) or C) above, including amendments, shall be fully implemented and a written validation (closure) report submitted to the Local Planning Authority for approval.\r\n\r\nReason: Contamination is known or suspected on the site due to a former land use. It is therefore necessary to ensure that the development can be implemented and occupied with adequate regard for public and environmental safety.\r\n\r\nSupporting Notes:\r\n(i)\tThe full Phase II site investigation, where required, must include sampling and/or testing for soil and groundwater contamination, soil gasses, vapours and leachate and test for potential contaminants identified within the Phase I Preliminary Risk Assessment. \r\n(ii)\tThe investigation shall be carried out at such points and at such depths as the local planning authority may stipulate. \r\n(iii)\tTesting for Total Hydrocarbons shall be undertaken using the TPH-CWG method. Where significant contamination is identified, to fully characterise the site the extent of this contamination should be confirmed by further intrusive site investigation and testing (i.e. delineation works). \r\n(iv)\tRisk assessments must adhere to current UK guidance and best practice. \r\nThe Council requests that site investigation reports or site plans be sent electronically to landq",
    "Condition : 20 - Drainage design\r\n\r\nThe drainage system and associated drainage features approved under P/2023/2387 shall be carried out in strict compliance with the approved details.\r\n\r\nReason: In order to prevent the risk of flooding to and from the site.\r\n",

The test reports shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority. The measures shall be retained thereafter.\r\n\r\nReason: In the interests of residential amenity.\r\n",
    "Condition : 25 - Obscure windows\r\n\r\nThe windows hereby approved to the rear walkways of the approved development shall be obscure glazed and non-opening below 1.7 metres above internal floor level.
