    "Condition : 38 - The development shall achieve 'Secured by Design' accreditation awarded by the Design-Out Crime Officer from the Metropolitan Police Service on behalf of the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO).\r\n\r\nNo dwelling shall be occupied until accreditation has been achieved and evidence of such accreditation has been submitted to the local planning authority.\r\nReason: In pursuance of the Council's duty under section 17 of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998.\r\nReason: In order to provide a socially inclusive and sustainable development.",
    "Condition : 39 - All lifts shall be made available for use before the first occupation of the building hereby permitted and shall be retained thereafter for use at all times without obstruction.  � they shall be constructed, installed and maintained in accordance with the principles set out in the Greater London Authority London Plan Guidance Sheet Policy D5(B5) or any document that supersedes this specification.\r\nReason: In order to ensure that the development complies with inclusive design principles.",
    "Condition : 40 - Four dwellings shall meet Building Regulation M4(3) 'wheelchair user dwellings'. The remaining dwellings shall meet Building Regulation M4(2) 'accessible and adaptable dwellings.  (Note: You can find additional detail in Habinteg Housing Association's Wheelchair Housing Design Guide, 3rd edition and their Lifetime Homes Design Guide). \r\nReason: In order to ensure that the development complies with inclusive design principles.\r\n",
    "Condition : 41 - No piling shall take place until a Piling Method Statement (detailing the depth and type of piling to be undertaken and the methodology by which such piling will be carried out, including measures to prevent and minimise the potential for damage to subsurface sewerage infrastructure, and the programme for the works) has been submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority in consultation with Thames Water.  Any piling must be undertaken in accordance with the terms of the approved piling method statement.\r\n\r\nReason: The proposed works will be in close proximity to underground sewerage utility infrastructure.  Piling has the potential to significantly impact / cause failure of local underground sewerage utility infrastructure. \r\n",
    "Condition : 42 - a) The cumulative measured or calculated rating level of noise emitted from the mechanical services plant including heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) to which this permission refers, shall be 10dB(A) below the existing background noise level, at all times that the plant operate. The measured or calculated noise levels shall be determined at the boundary of the nearest ground floor noise sensitive premises or one metre from the facade of the nearest first floor (or higher) noise sensitive premises, and in accordance to the latest British Standard 4142. An alternative position for assessment/measurement may be used to allow ease of access, this must be shown on a map and noise propagation calculations detailed to show how the design criteria are achieved. \r\n\r\nb) The plant shall be isolated on adequate proprietary anti-vibration mounts to prevent the structural transmission of vibration and regenerated noise within adjacent or adjoining premises, and these shall be so maintained thereafter.   \r\n\r\nc) Following installation of any mechanical services plant including heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) to which the application refers, a post completion noise assessment shall be submitted for approval to the local planning authority which demonstrates the actual measured rating level of plant operating under normal conditions. All measurements shall be made in accordance with the methodology of BS4142: 2014 (Methods for rating and assessing industrial and commercial sound) and/or its subsequent amendments. The post completion report shall be both completed and submitted to the local authority within 28 days of completion of the installation for review. If the plant fails to meet the specified standard, remedial measures shall be put in place immediately and the noise assessment shall be carried out again.  This shall be repeated until the assessment has reached the required standard.  Once achieved, the plant shall be maintained permanently ther"
