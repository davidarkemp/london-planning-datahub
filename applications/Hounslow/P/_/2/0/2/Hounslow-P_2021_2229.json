  "description": "T1 - Palm Cabbage (Cordyline australis)- Fell to ground level and remove all arisings, Grind out stump 30cm below ground level. Remove adjacent shrub and replace it after grind is complete as client wants to keep it. If we come across any large roots from the adjacent Plane tree we will have to stop grinding to avoid damaging them.\nT2 - Japanese Maple (Acer palmatum) - Selectively reduce branches all round by up to 0.5m to tidy and contain the tree, reducing overhang to the garden and thinning out to allow more light through without losing the natural shape of the tree.  T4 - Magnolia soulangeana - Reduce by 1-1.5m back to most recent previous reduction points, to tidy and contain, leaving some furnishing growth. Inspect pigeon spikes and replace any cable ties which are getting too tight.",
