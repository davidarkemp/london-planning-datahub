It is therefore necessary to ensure that the development can be implemented and occupied with adequate regard for public and environmental safety.\r\n\r\nSupporting notes: \r\n(i)\tThe Phase I desk study report will include the aims and objectives, data collection, site reconnaissance (walk over survey) and development of the initial Conceptual Site Model (CSM) with preliminary risk assessment whereby risk of all potential pollutant linkages are evaluated with a risk category. \r\n(ii)\tThe report must adhere to current UK guidance and best practice.\r\n(iii)\tThe report shall also make recommendations for the further gathering of information and/or intrusive investigation, to ensure that it will be possible to render the site safe for its proposed use.\r\n(iv)\tThe Council requests that the risk assessment reports or site plans are sent electronically to landquality@hounslow.gov.uk as well as being submitted to the local planning authority for approval.  \r\n",
    "Condition : 22 - Prior to commencement of the development hereby approved: Following the completion of the Phase I desk study report, if intrusive investigations or gas monitoring is recommended, a Phase II site investigation must be undertaken. No development other than necessary works to enable intrusive investigations shall take place until a Phase II site investigation report, prepared by a suitably qualified, experienced or supervised person, has been submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority. This report shall identify the areas and sources of land contamination that exist on the site and identify the scope of site remediation measures necessary before the development commences. The investigation shall be carried out by a competent person(s), based on the initial Conceptual Site Model (CSM) and on-site observations, to identify the extent and nature of contaminants. The initial CSM shall be updated accordingly following a tiered risk assessment based on the findings of the investigation, and where applicable, the report shall include proposals to deal with the identified contamination on site.\r\n\r\nReason: Contamination is known or suspected on the site due to a former land use. It is therefore necessary to ensure that the development can be implemented and occupied with adequate regard for public and environmental safety.\r\n\r\nSupporting Notes:\r\n(i)\tThe report shall include details of such sampling of soil, soil vapour, ground gas, leachate, surface water and/or groundwater at such locations and depths as are considered to characterise the site conditions based on the initial Conceptual Site Model (CSM) and on-site observations during investigation work. \r\n(ii)\tThe investigation and the report must adhere to current UK guidance and best practice.\r\n(iii)\tFurther investigation shall be carried out at such locations and at such depths as the local planning authority may stipulate if this report is found to be insufficient or where it is deemed necessary to",
    "Condition : 23 - Prior to commencement of the development hereby approved: If a scheme for remediation is recommended in the Phase II site investigation for the site, no development shall take place until a remediation method statement prepared by a suitably qualified, experienced or supervised person to specify the works necessary to render the site suitable for its proposed end use, has been submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority.\r\n\r\nReason: Contamination is known or suspected on the site due to a former land use. It is therefore necessary to ensure that the development can be implemented and occupied with adequate regard for public and environmental safety.\r\n\r\nSupporting Notes:\r\n(i)\tThe remediation method statement shall provide suitable details of how the risks of each pollutant linkages, as identified in the updated Conceptual Site Model, will be mitigated.\r\n(ii)\tThe report shall account for any comments made by the local planning authority. \r\n(iii)\tRemediation work shall be carried out in accordance with the approved remediation method statement for verification and validation before the development is first brought into use.\r\n(iv)\tThe Council requests that remediation method statement or site plans be sent electronically to landquality@hounslow.gov.uk as well as being submitted to the local planning authority for approval.\r\n",
    "Condition : 24 - During the development: The Local Planning Authority shall be notified immediately if any land contamination not previously identified is encountered during development. A competent person shall assess the contamination, where necessary, including soil and groundwater sampling and testing before any further part of the development that may be affected by the additional contamination that has been discovered continues. A revised remediation method statement, prepared by a suitably qualified, experienced or supervised person, shall be submitted in writing to the local planning authority for approval within one month of the discovery of such contamination.\r\n\r\nReason: Contamination is known or suspected on the site due to a former land use. It is therefore necessary to ensure that the development can be implemented and occupied with adequate regard for public and environmental safety.\r\n\r\nSupporting notes:\r\n(i)\tFurther remediation work to remove or manage additional contamination shall be carried out in accordance with the approved revised remediation method statement for verification and validation before the development is first brought into use. \r\n(ii)\tIn some instances, the local planning authority may require work on site to be ceased whilst the nature of additional contamination is investigated fully.\r\n(iii)\tThe Council requests that the revised remediation method statement or any site photos be sent electronically to landquality@hounslow.gov.uk as well as being submitted to the local planning authority for approval.\r\n",
    "Condition : 25 -  Prior to the development is first brought into use: The agreed scheme for remediation, including any amendments, shall be fully implemented. A verification report produced upon completion of the remediation by a suitably qualified, experienced or supervised person shall be submitted in writing to the local planning authority for approval, before the development is first brought into use or in accordance with a programme approved in writing by the local planning authority.\r\n\r\nReason: Contamination is known or suspected on the site due to a former land use. It is therefore necessary to ensure that the development can be implemented and occupied with adequate regard for public and environmental safety.\r\n\r\nSupporting notes:\r\n(i)\tThe verification (closure) report shall revisit the conceptual site model and provide evidence that each aspect of the remediation plan has been implemented correctly and successfully in accordance with current UK guidance and best practice. Where applicable, the report shall describe how any additional/unexpected contamination encountered during development has been managed in line with the revised remediation method statement. \r\n(ii)\tThis report shall demonstrate that the development is suitable for its proposed use in terms of land quality.\r\n(iii)\tThe Council requests that the verification report or site photos be sent electronically to landquality@hounslow.gov.uk as well as being submitted to the local planning authority for approval.\r\n",
    "Condition : 26 - If long term monitoring and maintenance is required following successful completion of approved remedial measures, reports which demonstrate the effectiveness of the monitoring and maintenance shall be prepared by a suitably qualified, experienced or supervised person and submitted to the local planning authority according to an agreed timescale as shall first have been approved under other conditions set out in this planning approval decision notice.\r\n\r\nReason: In order to ensure that risks from land contamination to the future users of the land and neighbouring land are minimised, together with those to controlled waters, properties and ecological systems.\r\n",
    "Condition : 27 - A). Notwithstanding the details on the approved plans, prior to commencement of groundworks (excluding site investigations and demolition), the applicant shall have submitted to the Local Planning Authority for approval in writing a final detailed drainage design, including drawings and supporting calculations and a Drainage Assessment Form to be reviewed and approved by the Lead Local Flood Authority. The drainage hierarchy shall make use of green infrastructure technology to comply with the hierarchy set out in London Plan Policy SI 13 and the runoff rate shall not exceed 2 litres/second. A detailed management plan confirming routine maintenance tasks for all drainage components shall also be submitted and approved which demonstrates how the drainage system is to be maintained for the lifetime of the development. The development shall be carried out in strict compliance with the approved details.\r\n\r\nB). No building hereby permitted shall be occupied until evidence (photographs and installation contracts) is submitted to demonstrate that the sustainable drainage scheme for the site has been completed in accordance with the submitted details. The sustainable drainage scheme shall be managed and maintained thereafter in accordance with the agreed management and maintenance plan for all of the proposed drainage components.\r\n\r\nReason: To prevent the risk of flooding to and from the site, in accordance with relevant policy requirements including but not limited to London Plan policies SI 12 and SI 13 (and its associated Sustainable Design and Construction SPG), the Non-Statutory Technical Standards for Sustainable Drainage Systems and Local Plan Policy EQ3.\r\n"
