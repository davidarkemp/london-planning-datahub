    "Condition : 1 - The development hereby permitted shall begin not later than three years from the date of this decision.\r\n\r\nReason: In order to comply with Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990, as amended by Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004.",

    "Reason : 1 - The proposed alterations to fenestration including replacement of front and rear windows and doors, replacement of roof tiles, erection of front canopy, by reason of size, design, materials and appearance would be intrusive developments, out of scale and character with this semi-detached house and the surrounding area, having an adverse effect on the visual amenities of the locality. Thus, it is contrary to Local Plan policies SC7, CC1 and CC2 of Local Plan, policies of London Plan and the National Planning Policy Framework.",

As the submission makes no justification or assessment of proposal of impact on the tree, in the absence of Arboricultural Assessment, it would be contrary to Local Plan policies CC1, CC2 and GB7 and the National Planning Policy Framework."
