The exit from the wheel wash shall be a hard, non-porous surface sited as far away from the exit as is possible given the site constraints and kept clean at all times.  Waste water discharged from the wheel wash shall be stored and disposed of on site and not discharged into the public sewer unless soil, stones and any suspended material have first been removed.\r\nThe developer shall ensure that no dust or other debris is carried on to adjoining properties in accordance with the guidance at https://www.london.gov.uk/file/18750/download?token=zV3ZKTpP. \r\nSite lighting shall be designed, positioned and directed so as not to unnecessarily intrude on passing drivers or direct light into any neighbouring windows in accordance with the guidance provided by the Institute of Lighting Engineers Guidance Note: For The Reduction Of Obtrusive Light 2021.\r\nAll vehicle arrivals and departures shall be supervised and the condition of the highway examined immediately afterwards.  Any materials shed from the vehicle during such movement shall be immediately removed from the highway, and returned to site or carted away for disposal and shall not be washed into the surface water drainage system.\r\n"
