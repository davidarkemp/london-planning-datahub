  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed size and design of the single storey rear extension would add a bulky addition to the rear, the size of the rear and side roof extensions and height of the outbuilding would harm the appearance of the host property and would be out of character for the area and the surrounding conservation area contrary to the Council's Residential Extension Guidelines (2017), Local Plan Policies CC1, CC2 and CC4 and the National Planning Policy Framework.",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed outbuilding, due to the inclusion of a bathroom and kitchenette, would not be incidental to the main dwellinghouse, and would result in increased activity within the garden with increased noise and disturbance to neighbouring properties, with the potential for the outbuilding to be used as a self-contained accommodation by current or future occupants. The proposal would therefore result in harm to neighbours' living conditions, and would be contrary to the Council's Residential Extension Guidelines (2017) and Local Plan Policy SC7, CC2 and the National Planning Policy Framework.",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed front vehicle access would lead to a net loss of parking, with one off-street space replacing two on-street CPZ bays, and has not adequately demonstrated that the off-street bay can be accessed and egressed in one, easy, and safe manoeuvre harming pedestrian and vehicle safety contrary to Councils Residential Crossover and Off-street Parking Policy 2016, Local Plan policy and the National Planning Policy Framework"
