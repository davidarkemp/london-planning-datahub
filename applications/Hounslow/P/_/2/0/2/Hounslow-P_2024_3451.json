  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The property would be not suitable for conversion, as the original floor space would be less than 130 square metres, would not located within 400 metres of a town centre, and would not located in an area with good access to public transportation. The proposal is therefore unacceptable in principle, contrary to Local Plan policy SC10 and the Houses in Multiple Occupation SPG.",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed development by reason of its size, scale, and design would fail to reflect to the proportions of the host dwelling and would not appear subservient. It would be an incongruous addition which would harm the character and appearance of the host property and wider area, contrary to Local Plan policies CC1, CC2, and SC7 and the intent of the Residential Extension Guidelines.",
    "Reason : 3 - The applicant has failed to demonstrate that the proposal would not result in increased disturbance to residents of neighbouring properties contrary to Local Plan policy SC10 and the Houses in Multiple Occupation SPG.",
    "Reason : 4 - The proposal would fail to provide a sufficient standard of accommodation for future occupiers by virtue of the inadequate external amenity space. The proposal is therefore contrary to Local Plan policies SC5 and SC10 and the Houses in Multiple Occupation SPD.",
    "Reason : 5 - The applicant has failed to demonstrate that the proposal would not result in harm to highway and pedestrian safety and additional excessive parking stress on the roads surrounding the development. The proposed development is therefore contrary to Local Plan policy EC2. ",
    "Reason : 6 - The proposal would fail to provide adequate waste and recycling facilities, contrary to Local Plan policies SC10 and EQ7 and the Houses in Multiple Occupation SPD and the Recycling and Refuse Guidance."
