  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposal, by reason of its position and relationship with neighbours, would lead to a loss of light and overshadowing harming neighbours living conditions contrary to Local Plan policy CC2. ",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposal, by reason of its form, position and design, would be an overbearing and visually obtrusive form of development failing to harmonise with and respond to the surrounding context of the site harming the character and appearance of the surrounding conservation area contrary to the NPPF, London Plan policies D3 and D4 and Local Plan policies CC1, CC2 and CC4.",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposal, by reason of insufficient daylight/sunlight to habitable rooms, would provide poor quality of living accommodation for future occupants contrary to London Plan policy D6 and Local Plan policies SC4 and SC5.",
    "Reason : 4 - The proposal would provide parking in excess of maximum parking standards and would therefore fail to promote sustainable modes of transport contrary to London Plan policy T6.1 and Local Plan policy EC2. ",
    "Reason : 5 - The proposal has failed to demonstrate that carbon dioxide reductions have been maximised on site contrary to London Plan policy SI 2 and Local Plan policy EQ1. ",
    "Reason : 6 - The proposal has failed to submit the mandatory information for Biodiversity Net Gain and is therefore contrary to Schedule 7A of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990. "
