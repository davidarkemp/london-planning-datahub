    "Reason : 1 - The proposed first floor rear extension, hip-to-gable extension, rooflights, light well and separate garden access of the original house, by reason of their position, size, height, design and appearance, would be an inappropriate development in St Paul's Brentford Conservation Area, failing to maintain and enhance the appearance and character of the street and the wider Conservation Area, as well as having a serious and adverse effect on the amenities enjoyed by adjoining residents, by reason of loss of light and overbearing appearance, contrary to Local Plan policies CC1; CC2; CC4; SC7, and the intent of the National Planning Policy Framework.",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed new dwelling, by reason of its position in the rear garden, excessive size, height, design and appearance, would be an intrusive and inappropriate development in St Paul's Brentford Conservation Area, failing to maintain and enhance the appearance and character of the street and the wider Conservation Area, as well as having a serious and adverse effect on the amenities enjoyed by adjoining residents, by reason of loss of light and overbearing appearance, contrary to Local Plan policies CC1; CC2; CC4; SC7, and the intent of the National Planning Policy Framework.",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed original and new dwelling, by reason of the design, the function of the basement, insufficient usable private and communal amenity space,  would be detrimental to the amenities enjoyed by prospective occupants, contrary to Local Plan policies CC1; CC2; CC4; SC5, SC7 and the Council's Residential Extension Guidelines (2017) and the intent of the National Planning Policy Framework.",
    "Reason : 4 - The proposed development, by reason of access design, inadequate transport, cycle parking and servicing information, would be harmful to local transport system, fail to support active transport and provide necessary services to prospective occupants contrary to Local Plan policies CC1; CC2; CC4; SC7; EQ7; EC2 and the Council's Residential Extension Guidelines (2017) and the intent of the National Planning Policy Framework"
