  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development would introduce a hot food takeaway within 400m of two primary schools, in an area with a high number of takeaways, and thus fail to promote the adoption of healthy lifestyles. This would be contrary to Paragraph 96 and 132 of the National Planning Policy Framework, London Plan Policy E9, GG2 and Local Plan Policies TC5 and CI3.",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed roof terrace, due to its position, depth, size and scale and proximity to neighbouring properties, would appear overly dominant and visually intrusive and allow direct and elevated views of neighbours' upper floor windows, resulting in significant harm to the living conditions through a loss of privacy, contrary to Local Plan Policy CC1 and the intent of the National Planning Policy Framework",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposal, by reason of the additional noise, disturbance and general levels of activity generated by the use, would result in unacceptable harm to neighbouring residents' living conditions, contrary to Local Plan Policies CC1, EQ5 and the intent of the National Planning Policy Framework.",
    "Reason : 4 - The applicant has failed to submit satisfactory information to demonstrate that the proposed kitchen extract system would not result in unacceptable air quality or noise disturbance to nearby residents and inadequate details as to the refuse and recycling arrangements have been provided. This would be contrary to Local Plan Policies CC1, EQ4, EQ5 and EQ7, and the intent of the National Planning Policy Framework.",
    "Reason : 5 - The application fails to provide sufficient supporting documentation regarding deliveries and servicing arrangements to demonstrate that the use can be operated without causing harm to highway safety, contrary to London Plan Policy T4 and Local Plan Policies EQ7 and EC2."
