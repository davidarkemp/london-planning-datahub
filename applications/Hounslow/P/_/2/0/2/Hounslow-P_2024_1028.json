  "description": "T1 Sycamore fell to ground level. (See Attached Sketch Plan) Due to direct damage to the detached building on land to the rear of 596 Chiswick High Road (See Report from Structural Design Studio) The tree is growing on a fenced-off area of unmanaged ground to the rear of 594 Chiswick High Road, with the trunk hard up against the eastern flank wall of the detached building. Replacement planting of a suitable tree can be undertaken in the land where the sycamore is growing. We would suggest a suitable tree such as a container grown field maple at 12-14cm girth is planted at least 3m from the detached outbuilding",
