    "Reason : 1 - The proposed first floor side and rear wraparound extensions, by reason of their inappropriate size and design, would be an overbearing and visually intrusive form of development resulting in a loss of outlook for neighbouring residents harming their living conditions contrary to Local Plan policies CC2 (Urban Design and Architecture) and SC7 (Residential Extensions and Alterations) and the intent of the Residential Extension Guidelines.",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposal, by reason of its excessive scale, design and massing, would fail to remain subordinate or reflect the proportions of the main house, and would result in overbearing and incongruous additions harming the character of the property and surrounding area contrary to Local Plan Policies CC1 (Context and Character), CC2 (Urban Design and Architecture) and SC7 (Residential Extensions and Alterations) and the intent of the Residential Extension Guidelines."
