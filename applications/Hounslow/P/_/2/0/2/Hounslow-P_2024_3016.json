    "Reason : 1 - The proposal, by reason of bedrooms' size and layout, poor outlook and daylight levels, would fail to provide an acceptable standard of accommodation for future occupants and would be overdevelopment of the site. The proposed is therefore contrary to Local Plan policies SC5 and SC10, London Plan Policies D6 and the aims and the National Planning Policy Framework and the Nationally Described Space standards. ",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposal, because of the nature and scale of the use in this location and in the absence of adequate management plan, would undermine the amenity of neighbouring properties and the locality generally contrary to Local Plan policies CC1, CC2.",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposal, by reason of the lack of safe, secure and accessible cycle parking spaces, would lead to an unsatisfactory development of the site and fail to promote sustainable forms of transport contrary to Local Plan policies EC1 and London Plan policy T5. "
