    "Reason : 1 - The proposed single storey side and rear extension by reason of its height and depth would be an intrusive and unneighbourly alteration, would lead to a loss of light and outlook to the neighbouring properties. Thus, it is contrary to Local Plan policies SC7, CC1 and CC2 of Local Plan, policies of London Plan and the National Planning Policy Framework.",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed single storey side and rear extension by reason of its height and position and the proposed enragement to the rear roof extension by reason of its size, position and design, would be out of scale and character with this and neighbouring dwellings, as well as having an adverse effect on the visual amenities of the locality and the Gunnersbury Park (Article 4) Conservation area. Thus, it is contrary to Local Plan policies SC7, CC1, CC2 and CC4 of Local Plan, policies of London Plan and the National Planning Policy Framework."
