    "Reason : 1 - The proposed advertisement, by virtue of its excessive size, scale and location, would introduce visual clutter which would harm the character, appearance and pedestrian experience of this section of the public streetscene. The applicant has failed to demonstrate that the proposal would not impact the existing tree within the green verge. The proposal is therefore contrary to Local Plan policies CC1 (Context and Character), CC5 (Advertisement Panels, Hoardings and Structures), and the intent of the NPPF.",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposal, due to its inappropriate size, scale, location and design, would result in undue harm to highway and traffic safety. It would therefore be contrary to Local Plan policy EC2 (Developing a Sustainable Local Transport Network) and CC5 (Advertisement Panels, Hoardings and Structures)."
