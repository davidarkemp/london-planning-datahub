It is considered that the proposed erection of a 20m 5G monopole, two equipment cabinets and a meter cabinet with ancillary works., is contrary to the provisions of Schedule 2 Part 16 of The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (As Amended) as the siting and appearance of the proposal would significantly harm the appearance of the area; therefore prior approval is required and hereby refused."
