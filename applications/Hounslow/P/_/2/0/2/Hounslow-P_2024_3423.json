    "Reason : 1 - Due to its design, excessive depth, width and bulk the proposal would be an overly dominant addition that would fail to relate subordinately to the main dwelling resulting in harm to the character and appearance of the local area contrary to Local Plan policies CC1, CC2 and SC7 as well as the guidance contained in the Hounslow Character, Sustainability and Design Codes SPD.",
    "Reason : 2 - Due to the excessive depth of the first floor rear projection and the proximity to the neighbouring properties the proposal would result in a loss of outlook and a sense of enclosure to the neighbouring occupiers contrary to Local Plan policies CC1, CC2 and SC7 as well as the guidance contained in the Hounslow Character, Sustainability and Design Codes SPD."
