    "Reason : 1 - Given its design, excessive size and lack of sufficient front and side setbacks, it is considered that the proposed development at this corner plot would result in an obtrusive development which would fail to remain subservient to the main house, and cause harm to its character and visual appearance, and that of the existing streetscene and surrounding area. This would be contrary to policies CC1 (Context and Character), SC7 (Residential Extensions and Alterations) of the adopted Local Plan (2015) and the intentions of the adopted Residential Extension Guidelines SPD. ",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed single storey rear extension, by virtue of its excessive depth and location, is considered to cause excessive harm to the living conditions of its adjoining neighbour at No.695 Bath Road by loss of light and increased sense of enclosure. The applicant has failed to demonstrate otherwise. The proposal would therefore not comply with adopted Local Plan Policy CC2 (Urban Design and Architecture), SC7 (Residential Extensions and Alterations) of the adopted Local Plan (2015) and the intentions of the adopted Residential Extension Guidelines SPD."
