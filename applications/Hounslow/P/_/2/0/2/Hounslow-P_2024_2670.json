    "Reason : 1 - The proposed outbuilding, given its improper design, excessive scale and size and the inclusion of a primary living accommodation by way of a bathroom, would result in a development that would no longer remain incidental to the main house, and be harmful to the character and appearance of the area and the living conditions of its neighbours. This would be contrary to policies CC1 (Context and Character), CC2 (Urban Design and Architecture), SC7 (Residential Extensions and Alterations) of the adopted Local Plan (2015) and the intent of the adopted Residential Extension Guidelines SPD. ",
    "Reason : 2 - Given its excessive size and position, and the constrained rear amenity space of within neighbouring properties, the single storey detached outbuilding is considered to cause excessive harm to the living conditions its adjacent neighbours by loss of outlook, overshadowing and increased sense of enclosure and overbearing. Therefore the proposal is contrary to Local Plan policies CC2 (Urban Design and Architecture), SC7 (Residential Extensions and Alterations) and the Residential Extension Guidelines SPG."
