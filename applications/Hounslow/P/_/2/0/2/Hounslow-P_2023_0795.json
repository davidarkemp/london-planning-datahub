    "Condition : 4 - The scheme of extract ventilation shown on the approved plans and specifications shall be carried out before the development hereby permitted is first occupied or brought into use and shall be maintained as specified thereafter and in accordance with the manufacturer's guidelines.",
    "Condition : 5 - a) The cumulative measured or calculated rating level of noise emitted from the mechanical services plant including heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) to which this permission refers, shall be 10dB(A) below the existing background noise level, at all times that the plant operate. The measured or calculated noise levels shall be determined at the boundary of the nearest ground floor noise sensitive premises or one metre from the facade of the nearest first floor (or higher) noise sensitive premises, and in accordance to the latest British Standard 4142. An alternative position for assessment/measurement may be used to allow ease of access, this must be shown on a map and noise propagation calculations detailed to show how the design criteria are achieved. \r\n\r\nb) The plant shall be isolated on adequate proprietary anti-vibration mounts to prevent the structural transmission of vibration and regenerated noise within adjacent or adjoining premises, and these shall be so maintained thereafter.   \r\n\r\nc) Following installation of any mechanical services plant including heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) to which the application refers, a post completion noise assessment shall be submitted for approval to the local planning authority which demonstrates the actual measured rating level of plant operating under normal conditions. All measurements shall be made in accordance with the methodology of BS4142: 2014 (Methods for rating and assessing industrial and commercial sound) and/or its subsequent amendments. The post completion report shall be both completed and submitted to the local authority within 28 days of completion of the installation for review. If the plant fails to meet the specified standard, remedial measures shall be put in place immediately and the noise assessment shall be carried out again.  This shall be repeated until the assessment has reached the required standard.  Once achieved, the plant shall be maintained permanently ther",
    "Condition : 6 - The access doorway to the [INSERT] shall have: a minimum clear width of 900mm; a level surface or ramp between the pavement and the floor not exceeding a gradient of 1:12; a door handle set no more than one metre above ground level and a 400 mm high steel 'kick plate' suitable for the needs of wheelchair users or shall be automatic opening.  In cases where the door has no frame and is part of a fully glazed frontage, the door and glazed frontage hereby approved shall be clearly defined with visual manifestations on the glass at two levels: between 850mm to 1000mm and 1400mm to 1600mm above ground level. The manifestations shall be fixed to, painted on or etched into the glass in the form of a continuous or broken (by no more than 20 mm) horizontal band 50 mm high, or a series of signs or logos at least 150mm high spaced no further than 300 mm apart.  The manifestations shall visually contrast with their surroundings when viewed from both inside and outside the building in all lighting conditions"
