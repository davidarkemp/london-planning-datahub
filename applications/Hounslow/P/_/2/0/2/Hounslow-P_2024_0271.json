    "Condition : 1 - The permission hereby granted shall be for a limited period, being the period of 18 months from the date of this decision.  The use hereby permitted shall cease and/or any approved structures shall be removed and the land restored to its former condition.",
    "Condition : 2 - The development hereby permitted shall be carried out in accordance with the following approved plans and specifications: [The proposal is not considered suitable as a permanent form of development to safeguard neighbours' living conditions and the character and appearance of the area.].",
    "Condition : 3 - The food stall hereby approved shall remain in the location as indicated on (approved plan) for the duration of the planning permission and shall not be moved or taken from the site during this period without first obtaining written permission from the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Condition : 4 - All deliveries and loading/unloading associated with the food stall shall be undertaken lawfully within designated loading areas and relevant waiting restrictions and shall not load directly from the public footway adjacent to the stall.",
    "Condition : 5 - Access to the existing E-bike bay to the south of the plaza within which the food stall is located, must not be obstructed by the development and its operations at any time.",
    "Condition : 6 - There must be no permanent fixtures to the public highway as a result of this development. The public highway must be restored to its former condition upon removal of the stall in the case that damage is caused.",
    "Condition : 7 - There must be no service connections associated with the stall unless approved in advance by Hounslow Highways. If any service connections are provided, they must be covered up or made safe upon removal of the stall.",
    "Condition : 8 - All refuse and recycling bins, delivery cages, trolleys or any other items linked to deliveries and collection in association with the approved development are to be stored within the stall at all times. Non-recyclable and perishable waste shall be removed from site no less frequently than once a week.  Waste shall be removed from the site to a suitable enclosed private storage area or an authorised refuse disposal or recycling site as soon as the bins become full if this is earlier than the time of the normal collection. No commercial waste must be disposed in existing litter bins available for use by the general public.",
    "Condition : 9 - The cumulative measured or calculated rating level of noise emitted from the mechanical services equipment including power supply, heating, ventilation and/or air conditioning (HVAC) to which this permission refers, shall be 10dB(A) below the existing background noise level, at all times that the plant operate. The measured or calculated noise levels shall be determined at the boundary of the nearest ground floor noise sensitive premises or one metre from the facade of the nearest first floor (or higher) noise sensitive premises, and in accordance to the latest British Standard 4142."
