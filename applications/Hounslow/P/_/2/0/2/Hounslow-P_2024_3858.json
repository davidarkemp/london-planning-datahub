    "Reason : 1 - The proposed two storey side extension, by reason of its excessive size and scale, and inappropriate position and design, would result in loss of light and outlook, and an increased sense of enclosure for neighbouring properties. The proposed development would therefore harm neighbours' living conditions and would be contrary to Local Plan Policies CC2 (Urban Design and Architecture) and SC7 (Residential Extensions and Alterations) and the Residential Extension Guidelines.",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed two storey side extension, by reason of its excessive size and scale, and inappropriate position and design, would fail to reflect to the proportions of the main house and would result in bulky and incongruous additions, which would harm the character and appearance of the site and surrounding area. This would be contrary to Local Plan Policies CC1 (Context and Character), CC2 (Urban Design and Architecture) and SC7 (Residential Extensions and Alterations) and the Residential Extension Guidelines.",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposal would, due to the excessive size and scale, fail to maintain sufficient amount of private amenity space, resulting in an unacceptable standard of accommodation for future occupiers, contrary to Local Plan Policies CC1 (Context and Character), CC2 (Urban Design and Architecture) and SC7 (Residential Extensions and Alterations) and the Residential Extension Guidelines."
