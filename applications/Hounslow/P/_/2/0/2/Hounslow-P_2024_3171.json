    "Reason : 1 - As a result of its inappropriate siting and design, its excessive scale and the limited size of the application site, the proposed outbuilding would result in an unacceptable loss of usable private amenity space and would not be in keeping with the existing character of the area. It would cause harm to the character and residential amenities of the host dwelling and the surrounding neighbourhood, and a result the proposal is contrary to Local Plan policies CC1 (Context and Character), SC7 (Residential Extensions and Alterations) and the Residential Extension Guidelines SPD.",
    "Reason : 2 - Given its excessive size and position, and the constrained layout of the application site and the neighbouring site to the south, the proposed outbuilding is considered to cause harm to the living conditions of the current and future occupiers of the application site itself, and those of the neighbour at 9b Redwood Estate, by way of loss of light, overshadowing and sense of enclosure. Therefore the proposal is contrary to Local Plan policies CC2 (Urban Design and Architecture), SC7 (Residential Extensions and Alterations) and the Residential Extension Guidelines SPD."
