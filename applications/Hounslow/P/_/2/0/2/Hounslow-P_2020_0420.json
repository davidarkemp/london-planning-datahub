    "Condition : 5 - Prior to the occupation of the restaurant hereby approved details of two internal staff cycle storage spaces, designed in accordance with the TFL Cycle Parking Design Standards, shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority, made available before the use commences and permanently retained as such.",
    "Condition : 6 - The use shall not commence until a secure storage area within the rear yard of the site has been enclosed by a two metre high close boarded fence to house not less than two 1100 litre galvanised steel Eurobins, together with facilities for the separation and safe storage of glass, metal, plastics, cardboard, food waste and other recyclable materials which shall then be collected and taken to a suitable facility for recycling.  \r\n\r\nThe storage area and bins shall be made permanently available before the development is first occupied and no waste shall be stored outside the site or other than in the designated area.  The lids of the Eurobins shall be fixed shut at all times other than when waste is being emptied into them.  Non-recyclable and perishable waste shall be removed from the site no less frequently than once a week.  \r\n\r\nWaste shall be removed from the site to a suitable enclosed private storage area or an authorised refuse disposal or recycling site as soon as the bins become full if this is earlier than the time of the normal collection, unless additional covered and enclosed bins (as described above) have been provided and are thereafter made permanently available for the on-site storage of refuse and waste.\r\n\r\nAll delivery vehicles serving the restaurant unit shall access it and offload goods in the rear car park/ servicing area only and not from the public highway.",

The measured or calculated noise levels shall be determined at the boundary of the nearest ground floor noise sensitive premises or 1 meter from the facade of the nearest first floor (or higher) noise sensitive premises, and in accordance to the latest British Standard 4142; An alternative position for assessment /measurement may be used to allow ease of access, this must be shown on a map and noise propagation calculations detailed to show how the design criteria is achieved.  \r\n\r\nb)\tThe plant shall be isolated on adequate proprietary anti-vibration mounts to prevent the structural transmission of vibration and regenerated noise within adjacent or adjoining premises, and these shall be so maintained thereafter.  \r\n\r\nc)\tFollowing installation of any mechanical services plant including heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) to which the application refers, a post completion noise assessment shall be submitted for approval to the local planning authority which demonstrates the actual measured rating level of plant operating under normal conditions. All measurements shall be made in accordance with the methodology of BS4142: 2014 (Methods for rating and assessing industrial and commercial sound) and/or its subsequent amendments. The post completion report shall be both completed and submitted to the local authority within 28 days of completion of the installation for review.  \r\n\r\nd)\tOdour control measures shall be fitted to the kitchen ventilation system before the kitchen is first brought into use, with carbon filters as a minimum.
