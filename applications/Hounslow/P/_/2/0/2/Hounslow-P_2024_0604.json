    "Condition : 1 - The development hereby permitted shall be begun before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.\r\n\r\nReason: To accord with provisions of Section 92(1) of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990.\r\n",
    "Condition : 2 - The materials to be used in the construction of the external surfaces of the extension and reinstated front boundary wall hereby permitted shall match those used in the existing building.\r\n\r\nReason: In order to safeguard the visual amenity of the area and building in particular.\r\n",
    "Condition : 3 - The proposed development shall be carried out in all respects in accordance with the proposals contained in the application and the plans and documents submitted (Drawing L2399/09[Rev.B], received 29/05/2024 and Drawings L2399/LP[Rev.A], L2399/01[Rev.A], L2399/02[Rev.A], L2399/03, L2399/05[Rev.G] L2399/10, L2399[Rev.A], L2399/34 and 'ELEVATIONS', and Planning Fire Safety Strategy [Rev.A3-C1, 15/02/2024: 2399-RDJWL-XX-XX-RP-A-0040], received 22/03/2024) therewith and approved by the Local Planning Authority, or as shall have been otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority before the building is used.\r\nReason: To ensure the development is carried out in accordance with the planning permission.\r\n",
    "Condition : 4 - No demolition or construction work shall take place on the site except between the hours of 8:00am to 6:00pm on Mondays to Friday and 9:00am to 1:00pm on Saturdays and none shall take place on Sundays and Public Holidays without the prior agreement of the Local Planning Authority.\r\n\r\nReason: In order to safeguard the amenities of adjoining residential properties and to ensure that the proposed development does not prejudice the amenities of the locality.\r\n",
    "Condition : 5 - The windows formed in the flank elevation shall be obscure glazed, hinged to open inwards and shall not be repaired or replaced otherwise than with obscured glazing.\r\n\r\nReason: To prevent overlooking of the nearby premises.\r\n",
    "Condition : 6 - Before the development hereby permitted is first occupied or brought into use, the sections of footway to the front of the site which are shown on drawing number L2399/09[Rev.B] as being reinstated shall have had their dropped kerbs restored back to standard kerbs, so that these sections cannot be used as unlawful accesses across the pavement.\r\n\r\nReason: In order to enhance the pedestrian environment and to confine vehicular access to the permitted points in order to ensure that the development does not prejudice the free flow of traffic or highway safety along the adjacent highway.\r\n",
    "Condition : 7 - Either side of the vehicle access hereby approved, visibility splay areas (the depth measured from the back of the footway and the widths outwards from the edges of the access, with a splay of at least 2.4 metres x 2.4 metres) shall be provided before the access and parking area is brought into use.  These areas shall be kept clear of any obstructions to visibility greater than 600 mm in height, including shrubs, planting, boundary walls, fences, gates, other means of enclosure or other structures or objects at all times.\r\n\r\nReason:  To ensure adequate visibility for drivers entering and leaving the site in the interests of pedestrian and vehicle safety.\r\n",
    "Condition : 8 - Notwithstanding the submitted details and prior to occupation, full details (including manufacturer's specifications) of all cycle stands for the occupants of, and visitors to, the development shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority. The approved facilities shall conform with Westtrans West London Cycle Parking Guidance (or such other guidance as shall supersede it) in design and layout.\r\n\r\nThe approved facilities shall be fully implemented and made available for use before any part of the development is first occupied and thereafter retained for use at all times without obstruction.\r\n\r\nReason: To support sustainable transport objectives.\r\n",
    "Condition : 9 - No waste and recycling bins shall be left outside the building at any time other than for collection.\r\n\r\nReason: To ensure that the proposed development does not prejudice the amenities of the locality.\r\n",
    "Condition : 10 - At no time shall the rear of the site be used for the parking of storage of vehicles, including cars.\r\n\r\nReason: To ensure that the proposed development does not result in an overprovision of vehicle parking on the site which would cause harm to occupiers' and neighbours' living conditions and to the character of the area.\r\n",
    "Condition : 11 - Before the development hereby permitted is first occupied or brought into use, the Local Planning Authority shall be informed of the agreed naming and numbering of the proposed dwellings so that arrangements can be put in place to ensure that, with the exception of a person eligible for a disabled person's badge issued pursuant to section 21 of the Chronically Sick and Disabled Persons Act 1970 (or similar legislation), no resident of the development shall obtain a resident's parking permit. Any occupiers of the approved development shall surrender any such permit wrongly issued or held.\r\n\r\nReason: In order to protect the free flow and safety of traffic on nearby highways and to support sustainable transport objectives.\r\n",
