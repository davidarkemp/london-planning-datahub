  "description": "We propose to build on an existing wall to the right side of the front of the driveway of no.19 taking the wall's height to 1.56m with a pillar at the end of the wall sitting at 1.66m. The wall in question is between our property at no.19 and the neighbours at no.17. The existing wall to be built upon, is currently sitting at 32cm high, which is owned and was constructed by us in 2015. Prior to 2015 the front gardens were only separated by small hedges and shrubbery. (This can be seen on Google maps and has also been attached in the site and other plans section) There is an existing wall adjacent to the proposed wall on the left side of the property. This wall is of the same height of 1.56m as the proposed wall and has a pillar of the same height of 1.66m. Erecting the proposed wall to the same height of the existing wall on the left side will introduce perfect symmetry to the front of the property at no.19 Being the end property only adjoined with no.17, aesthetically this would be pleasing, and have no bearing on any of the other properties on the road. In between to the two walls we propose to install bi-folding gates across the full length at a height of 1.3m. Please see diagram with measurements as attached.",
