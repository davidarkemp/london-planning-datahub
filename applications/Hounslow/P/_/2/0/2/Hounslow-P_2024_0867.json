The measured or calculated noise levels shall be determined at the boundary of the nearest ground floor noise sensitive premises or 1 meter from the facade of the nearest first floor (or higher) noise sensitive premises, and in accordance to the latest British Standard 4142; \r\nb)\tThe plant shall be isolated on adequate proprietary anti-vibration mounts to prevent the structural transmission of vibration and regenerated noise within adjacent or adjoining premises, and these shall be so maintained thereafter.\r\n",
    "Condition : 5 - Within 3 months of installation of any mechanical services plant including heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) to which the application refers, a post completion noise assessment shall be submitted for approval to the local planning authority which demonstrates the actual measured rating level of plant operating under normal conditions. All measurements shall be made in accordance with the methodology of BS4142: 2014 (Methods for rating and assessing industrial and commercial sound) and/or its subsequent amendments. "
