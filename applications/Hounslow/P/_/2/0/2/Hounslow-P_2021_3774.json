  "description": "This is an Assisted Living Proposal. This proposal consists of a new rear extension to the current existing houses numbers 25 and 27 Shenley Road to create additional space to accommodate the internal reconfiguration of the spaces within each dwelling to enable twenty individual rooms being created for the Assisted Living initiative. There will be a staff office located within the building and both properties will be inter-linked internally on both the ground and first floors. The existing further properties of 25a, 25b, 27a and 27b will each have a rear extension projecting three metres at the rear to allow for the internal re configuration to provide three rooms to the ground area and four to the upper first floor making 7 No rooms in total to each dwelling. There will be two staff offices located to two of the four dwellings and each dwelling will remain separated for the adjoining property with the offices serving both houses. Please note that this site and houses are existing.",
