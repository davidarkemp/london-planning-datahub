    "Reason : 1 - The proposed illuminated communication hub with advertisement display, by reason of its position, size, design, external appearance and illumination would introduce an incongruous addition which would cause visual clutter and adversely impact the setting of the area, resulting in harm to the pedestrian experience along the street, and harm to pedestrian and highway safety. Therefore, the proposal is contrary to Local Plan policies CC1, CC2, CC5, and EC2, and the intent of NPPF."
