    "Reason : 1 - The proposal would fail to retain an acceptable level of outdoor space and would constitute an overdevelopment of a constrained site. The outbuilding is overly dominant with an incongruous appearance that fails to relate incidentally or subordinately to the main dwelling causing harm to the character and appearance of the local area and streetscene contrary to Local Plan policies CC1, CC2 and SC7 as well as the council's design guidance.",
    "Reason : 2 - The retention of the outbuilding would result in an increased sense of noise and disturbance to neighbours due to its non-incidental nature as well as a loss of outlook and an overbearing sense of enclosure to neighbouring occupiers contrary to Local Plan policies CC1, CC2 and SC7 as well as the council's design guidance."
