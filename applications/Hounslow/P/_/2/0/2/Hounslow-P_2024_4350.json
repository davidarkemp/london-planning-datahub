    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development, by virtue of its size, scale, position and design, would fail to be proportionated, subordinated and subservient to the host building. Instead, it would create an overly dominant and incongruous addition that would negatively impact the character and appearance of both the host property and the surrounding area. The proposal is therefore contrary to Local Plan Policies CC1 (Context and Character), CC2 (Urban Design and Architecture) and SC7 (Residential Extensions and Alterations); the Part A5 of the Hounslow Character, Sustainability and Design Codes SPD, and the principles of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023).",
    "Reason : 2 - The porch and main door alterations, by reason of their design and style, are inconsistent with both the host property and the surrounding area, detracting from the overall character of the neighbourhood, contrary to Local Plan Policies CC1 (Context and Character), CC2 (Urban Design and Architecture) and SC7 (Residential Extensions and Alterations); the Part A5 of the Hounslow Character, Sustainability and Design Codes SPD.",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed extension, by virtue of its inappropriate scale and positioning, would result in a loss of light, outlook and increased sense of enclosure, which would harm the neighbours' living conditions, contrary to Local Plan Policies CC2 (Urban Design and Architecture) and SC7 (Residential Extensions and Alterations); the Part A5 of the Hounslow Character, Sustainability and Design Codes SPD, and the principles of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023)."
