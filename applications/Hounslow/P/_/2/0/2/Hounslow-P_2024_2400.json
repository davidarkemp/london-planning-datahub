  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The subject property is not located within convenient walking distance of town centre facilities, and is not located within an area with good public transport links. The proposal is therefore unacceptable in principle, contrary to Local Plan policy SC10 and the Houses in Multiple Occupation SPD.",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposal fails to demonstrate that the property is suitable for conversion; the applicant has failed to demonstrate that the original dwellinghouse is greater than 130 square metres in area, and therefore fails the minimum size threshold to be eligible for conversion. The proposal is therefore unacceptable in principle, contrary to Local Plan policy SC10 and the Houses in Multiple Occupation SPD.",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposal would fail to provide a sufficient standard of accommodation for future occupiers, by virtue of the failure to provide a drying area. The proposal is therefore contrary to Local Plan policies SC5 and SC10 and the Houses in Multiple Occupation SPD.",
    "Reason : 4 - The proposal has failed to demonstrate that the proposal would not result in increased disturbance to residents of neighbouring properties contrary to Local Plan policy SC10 and the Houses in Multiple Occupation SPD.",
    "Reason : 5 - The proposal has failed to demonstrate that there is sufficient capacity on the local road network to accommodate the additional demand for vehicles, contrary to Local Plan policy EC2 and the Houses in Multiple Occupation SPD. "
