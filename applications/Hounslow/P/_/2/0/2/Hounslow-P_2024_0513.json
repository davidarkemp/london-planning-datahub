    "Condition : 1 - The development hereby permitted shall begin not later than three years from the date of this decision.\r\nReason: In order to comply with Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990, as amended by Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004.",
    "Condition : 2 - The development hereby permitted shall be carried out in accordance with the following approved plans and specifications: Location Plan, GTD1101 � 05FA2, GTD1101 � 01FA2, GTD1101 � 02FA2, GTD1101 � 04FA2, Fire Strategy Plan, Energy statement received 17/04/2024.\r\nReason: In order to ensure the development is carried out in accordance with the planning permission.",
    "Condition : 3 - Customers shall only be permitted on the premises between the following hours:\r\n07:00 � 23:00 Mondays � Sundays;\r\nReason: In order to protect neighbours' living conditions. \r\nNote: If this approved use requires a trading licence from the Council (for example, because you intend to sell alcohol or offer entertainment) you should obtain this before you start to trade and note that the Licensing Panel will enquire about and wish you to disclose the terms of this permission and will likely align the terms of the licence with those set out here.  If your licence application seeks to exceed these hours, you will first need to have sought and obtained formally a variation to this condition by making a planning application.\r\n",
    "Condition : 4 - Before the development hereby permitted is first occupied or brought into use, the existing vehicular access to Syon Lane shall be permanently closed and kerbs and footway reinstated so that it cannot be used as an access across the pavement.\r\nReason: In order to enhance the pedestrian environment and to confine vehicular access to the permitted points in order to ensure that the development does not prejudice the free flow of traffic or highway safety along the adjacent highway."
