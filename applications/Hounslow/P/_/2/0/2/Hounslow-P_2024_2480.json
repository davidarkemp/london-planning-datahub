Thus, it is contrary to Local Plan Policies SC7, CC1, CC2 and CC4 and the intent of the National Planning Policy Framework.",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed replacement of rear first floor outrigger window with projecting window, by reason of its position, size, design and appearance, would be intrusive alterations, as well as leading to overlooking and loss of privacy to the neighbouring properties, out of scale and character with this and neighbouring dwellings, as well as having an adverse effect on the visual amenities of the locality. Thus, it is contrary to Local Plan policies SC7, CC1, CC2 and CC4, and the intent of National Planning Policy Framework.",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed rendering to the ground floor front elevation, by reason of its position, design and external appearance, would be an intrusive development, out of scale and character with the prevailing pattern of development in the locality, as well as having an adverse effect on the visual amenities of the neighbouring residents, failing to maintain and enhance the appearance and character of the St Paul's Brentford Conservation Area. Thus, it is contrary to Local Plan Policies CC1, CC2 and CC4 and the intent of the National Planning Policy Framework.\r\n"
