    "Condition : 1 - The materials used on the external surfaces of the development shall match those used in the building to which it is attached in terms of style, colour, texture and, in the case of brickwork, bonding, coursing and pointing (other than materials used in the construction of a conservatory).\r\nReason: In order to protect the appearance of the area.",
    "Condition : 2 - Any window located in a wall or roof slope forming a side elevation of the dwellinghouse must be: (a) obscure-glazed; and (b) non-opening unless the parts of the window which can be opened are more than 1.7 metres above the floor of the room in which the window is installed. Any such windows shall, once installed, be retained permanently as such, and once built no further side windows shall be installed.\r\nReason: In order to protect neighbours' living conditions.",
    "Reason : 1 - Due to its excessive depth, height and proximity to the shared boundary the proposal would result in in an unacceptable loss of outlook and an unneighbourly sense of enclosure to a neighbouring occupier contrary to policy SC7 and the design guidance contained within the Residential Extension Guidelines SPD."
