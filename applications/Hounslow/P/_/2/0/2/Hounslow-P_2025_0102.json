    "Reason : 1 - The proposed change of use of the existing public house and adjoining outbuilding to residential flats, would result in the loss of a community facility/use which is not demonstrated via marketing that it is not appropriate for any other community uses to meet existing and future needs of the community. Thus it is contrary to Local Plan policy CI1 and the National Planning Policy Framework.",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposal, provides inadequate quality of accommodation; due to poor outlook and light levels and insufficient provision of private amenity space to be provided at the site and so would be detrimental to the amenities enjoyed by prospective occupants of this development and would fail to provide an acceptable standard of accommodation for future occupants. Thus it is contrary to Local Plan policies SC5, CC1 and CC2 of Local Plan, policies of London Plan and the National Planning Policy Framework.",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed noise mitigation does not adequately reduce the impact of noise from transport and the commercial fan, therefore the development therefore fails to demonstrate that there would be no harm to future occupiers living conditions and is contrary to Local Plan Policy EQ5 and the National Planning Policy Framework.",
    "Reason : 4 - The proposal, by reason of unclear location of servicing, refuse, recycling and cycle parking facilities, and how this would work with shared courtyard, would lead to an unsatisfactory development of the site and prejudice safe functioning of the public highway, contrary to Local Plan policy EC2, London Plan policies T5, T6 and T7 and the The proposed change of use of the existing public house and adjoining outbuilding to residential flats, would result in the loss of a community facility/use which is not demonstrated via marketing that it is not appropriate for any other community uses to meet existing and future needs of the community. Thus it is contrary to Local Plan policy CI1 and the National Planning Policy Framework."
