    "Reason : 1 - The proposal by reason of its inappropriate size, scale and positioning, would result in overshadowing and loss of outlook to neighbouring properties. The proposed development would therefore harm neighbouring living conditions and would be contrary to Local Plan Policies CC1 (Context and Character), CC2 (Urban Design and Architecture) and SC7 (Residential Extensions and Alterations) and the intent of the Residential Extension Guidelines.",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposal, by reason of the excessive size and scale, and inappropriate position and design, would fail to reflect to the proportions of the main house and would result in bulky and incongruous additions, which would harm the character and appearance of the site and surrounding area. This would be contrary to Local Plan Policies CC1 (Context and Character), CC2 (Urban Design and Architecture) and SC7 (Residential Extensions and Alterations) and the intent of the Residential Extension Guidelines."
