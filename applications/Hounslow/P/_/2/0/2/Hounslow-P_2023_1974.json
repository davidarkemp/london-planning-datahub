    "Condition : 13 - No building hereby permitted shall be occupied until evidence (photographs and installation contracts) is submitted to demonstrate that the sustainable drainage scheme for the site has been completed in accordance with the submitted details. The sustainable drainage scheme shall be managed and maintained thereafter in accordance with the agreed management and maintenance plan for all of the proposed drainage components.  \r\nReason: To comply with the Non-Statutory Technical Standards for Sustainable Drainage Systems, the National Planning Policy Framework (Paragraph 103), the London Plan (Policies SI 12 and SI 13) along with associated guidance to these policies and Hounslow Council's Local Plan Policy EQ3.\r\n",
    "Condition : 14 - During the development:\r\nThe Local Planning Authority shall be notified immediately if any land contamination not previously identified is encountered during development. A competent person shall assess the contamination, where necessary, including soil and groundwater sampling and testing before any further part of the development that may be affected by the additional contamination that has been discovered continues. \r\nA revised remediation method statement, prepared by a suitably qualified, experienced or supervised person, shall be submitted in writing to the local planning authority for approval within one month of the discovery of such contamination. \r\nReason: Contamination is known or suspected on the site due to a former land use. It is therefore necessary to ensure that the development can be implemented and occupied with adequate regard for public and environmental safety.\r\n\r\nSupporting notes:\r\n(i)           Further remediation work to remove or manage additional contamination shall be carried out in accordance with the approved revised remediation method statement for verification and validation before the development is first brought into use. \r\n(ii)          In some instances, the local planning authority may require work on site to be ceased whilst the nature of additional contamination is investigated fully.\r\n(iii)         The Council requests that the revised remediation method statement or any site photos be sent electronically to landquality@hounslow.gov.uk as well as being submitted to the local planning authority for approval.\r\n",
    "Condition : 15 - \r\nPrior to the development is first brought into use:\r\nIf unexpected contamination encountered during development, the agreed scheme for remediation, including any amendments, shall be fully implemented. A verification report produced upon completion of the remediation by a suitably qualified, experienced or supervised person shall be submitted in writing to the local planning authority for approval, before the development is first brought into use or in accordance with a programme approved in writing by the local planning authority. \r\nReason: Contamination is known or suspected on the site due to a former land use. It is therefore necessary to ensure that the development can be implemented and occupied with adequate regard for public and environmental safety.\r\n\r\nSupporting notes:\r\n(i)           The verification (closure) report shall revisit the conceptual site model and provide evidence that each aspect of the remediation plan has been implemented correctly and successfully in accordance with current UK guidance and best practice. Where applicable, the report shall describe how any additional/unexpected contamination encountered during development has been managed in line with the revised remediation method statement. \r\n(ii)          This report shall demonstrate that the development is suitable for its proposed use in terms of land quality.\r\n(iii)         The Council requests that the verification report or site photos be sent electronically to landquality@hounslow.gov.uk as well as being submitted to the local planning authority for approval.\r\n",
    "Condition : 17 - Prior to first use of the development, full details of the arrangements for the storing of waste and recycled materials (including details of how the placing of waste and recycled materials in a suitable location for collection would be undertaken and managed) have been submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority. The development shall not be carried out otherwise than in strict accordance with the approved details.\r\nReason: To ensure adequate provision for waste and recycling, in accordance with Local Plan policies CC2, EC2 and SC5 and London Plan policy SI7.\r\n",
    "Condition : 18 - All Non-Road Mobile Machinery (NRMM) of net power of 37kW and up to and including 560kW used during the course of the demolition, site preparation and construction phases of the development hereby approved shall comply with the emission standards set out in chapter 7 of the GLA's supplementary planning guidance (SPG) 'Control of Dust and Emissions During Construction and Demolition' dated July 2014, or subsequent guidance. Unless it complies with the standards set out in the SPG, no NRMM shall be on site, at any time, whether in use or not. The developer shall keep an up to date list of all NRMM used during the demolition, site preparation and construction phases of the development on the online register at https://nrmm.london/.\r\nReason: In the interests of air quality and to protect neighbours' living conditions and the wider local environment.\r\n",
    "Condition : 19 - Before the development hereby permitted is first occupied or brought into use, a Biodiversity Enhancement Strategy (BES) shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority. The development shall not be carried out otherwise than in accordance with the approved details.\r\nReason: In order to promote biodiversity and ecological enhancements.\r\n",
    "Condition : 20 - Prior to the occupation of the development the post-construction tab of the GLA's Whole Life-Cycle Carbon Assessment template should be completed in line with the GLA's Whole Life-Cycle Carbon Assessment Guidance.\r\nThe post-construction assessment should be submitted to the GLA at: ZeroCarbonPlanning@london.gov.uk, along with any supporting evidence as per the guidance. Confirmation of submission to the GLA shall be submitted to, and approved in writing by, the local planning authority, prior to occupation of the development.\r\nReason: In the interests of sustainable development and to maximise on-site carbon dioxide savings.\r\n",
    "Condition : 21 - Prior to the occupation of the development, a post-construction monitoring report should be completed in line with the GLA?s Circular Economy Statement Guidance.\r\nThe post-construction monitoring report shall be submitted to the GLA, currently via email at: circulareconomystatements@london.gov.uk, along with any supporting evidence as per the guidance. Confirmation of submission to the GLA shall be submitted to, and approved in writing by, the local planning authority, prior to occupation of the development."
