  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - 1.\tThe subject property is not located within convenient walking distance of town centre facilities, and is not located within an area with good public transport links, having a PTAL of 2.  Furthermore, the original un-extended house has a net floor area which fails to meet the threshold requirement of a minimum 130sqm net original internal floor area to be considered suitable for conversion into a large HMO (Sui Generis). The proposal is therefore unacceptable in principle, contrary to Local Plan policy SC10 and the Houses in Multiple Occupation SPD.",
    "Reason : 2 - 2.\tThe applicant has failed to consider the scheme's impact on existing amenities. Further, the applicant has failed to demonstrate that the cumulative impact of the proposal, together with other similar developments present in the surrounding area, would not result in an unacceptable impact upon the living conditions of neighbouring properties and the wider area. This would be contrary to Local Plan policy SC10, CC2 and the Houses in Multiple Occupation SPD.",
    "Reason : 3 - 3.\tThe proposal has failed to demonstrate that the proposal would not have an adverse impact upon parking conditions in the area, contrary to Local Plan policies SC10, EC2 and the Houses in Multiple Occupation SPD.",
    "Reason : 4 - 4.\tThe proposal has filed to demonstrate that the two parking spaces to the rear of the property would have suitable clearance, or swept path in order to function as an adequate car park, contrary to SC10 and the Residential Crossovers and Off-Street Parking Policy ",
    "Reason : 5 - 5.\tThe proposal has failed to demonstrate that adequate waste and recycling facilities could be provided without having an adverse impact upon the character of the area, contrary to Local Plan policies SC10 and EQ7 and the Houses in Multiple Occupation SPD and the Recycling and Refuse Guidance."
