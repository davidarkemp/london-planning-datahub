  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - Owing to the unacceptable loss of green open space, the formation of excessive hard surfacing and new boundary treatment and the prominent positioning of the proposed car parking area, the proposal would cause harm to the setting of the Grade II Listed Building and the character of the wider Bedfont Green Conservation Area and would therefore run contrary to Local Plan Policies CC1 and CC4 and the intent of the Bedfont Green Conservation Area Appraisal.",
    "Reason : 2 - Owing to the creation of a new vehicular access with inadequate pedestrian visibility, on a narrow section of road which is already hazardous and is actively used by pedestrians (including children and other groups with protected characteristics) and serves as the only section of footway on this part of Bedfont Green Close, the proposal would pose an undue risk to pedestrian and highway safety which would run contrary to Local Plan Policy EC2 and the Council's adopted Residential Crossover and Off Street Parking policy. The proposal would also have the potential to result in an overprovision of car parking at the site, which would be contrary to Policy EC2 and London Plan parking provision standards, and has failed to provide reasonable justification for the area for fire vehicles marked out on the submitted plans."
