  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The application has failed to demonstrate that 'Very Special Circumstances' exist to outweigh the significant harm to the openness of the Green Belt resulting from the proposed inappropriate development. The scheme therefore fails to meet the requirements of the NPPF, London Plan policies G2, and Local Plan policies GB1.",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposal, by virtue of its location outside designated employment land, would run contrary to London Plan policy E4 and E7, and Local Plan policy ED1 and would therefore not be acceptable in principle.",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposal, by virtue of its location, inappropriate massing, and poor design, would result in a visually obtrusive development that would not be in keeping with the character of the surrounding area. This would be contrary to Local Plan policies CC1, CC2 and the intent of the NPPF",
    "Reason : 4 - The proposed vehicle access and servicing layout by virtue of their location and design would be unacceptable and fail to provide a satisfactory provision to the detriment of highway safety. This would be contrary to London Plan policies T4 and T7, and Local Plan policy EC2.",
    "Reason : 5 - The application has failed to demonstrate that policy compliant sustainability and ecology objectives would be met. This would be contrary to Local Plan policies EQ1, EQ2 and GB7"
