{
  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The property does not have an original net internal floor area of at least 130 square metres, fails to provide a good standard of living conditions for future occupiers and would result in some harm to the residential amenity and character of the area from over-intensification of the site, and is therefore considered unsuitable for conversion in principle. The application therefore conflicts with Local Plan policy SC6.",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposal fails to provide adequate internal living conditions for the ground floor flat in respect of access to sunlight and outlook, and does not provide any private or communal amenity space for the first floor flat, resulting in poor quality accommodation and sub-standard living conditions. The application therefore conflicts with Local Plan policy SC5. ",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed extensions would, because of their scale, bulk and incongruous design and the highly prominent corner setting of the property, cause significant harm to the character and amenities of the original house, pair of semis and wider street, contrary to Local Plan policies CC1, CC2 and SC7 and the intent of the Residential Extension Guidelines. ",
    "Reason : 4 - The proposed development has failed to demonstrate that there would be adequate cycle and car parking provisions for future occupiers within this low-accessibility location, and as such the application conflicts with Local Plan policy EC2."
