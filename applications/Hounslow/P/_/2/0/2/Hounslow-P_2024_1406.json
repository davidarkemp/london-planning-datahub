    "Reason : 1 - The proposal, by reason of its scale, depth, position and proximity to the neighbouring property at 118 Cranford Lane, would appear overly dominant and visually intrusive, resulting in significant harm to the living conditions of that property through loss of daylight, a loss of outlook, and an increased sense of enclosure, harmful to that neighbour's living conditions. The proposal is therefore contrary to adopted Local Plan Policies CC2 (Urban Design and Architecture), SC7 (Residential Extensions and Alterations) and the intent of the Residential Extensions Guidelines.",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposal by virtue of its size, scale, design and lack of set back from the main front wall the dwelling would result in a bulky, obtrusive and incongruous addition which would significantly harm the character and appearance of the host property and area, contrary to adopted Local Plan Policies CC1 (Context and Character), CC2 (Urban Design and Architecture) and SC7 (Residential Extensions and Alterations) and the intent of the Supplementary Planning Document Residential Extensions Guidelines."
