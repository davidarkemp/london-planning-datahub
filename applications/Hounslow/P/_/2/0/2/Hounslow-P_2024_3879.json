A competent person shall assess the contamination, where necessary, including soil and groundwater sampling and testing before any further part of the development that may be affected by the additional contamination that has been discovered continues.\r\nA revised remediation method statement, prepared by a suitably qualified, experienced or supervised person, shall be submitted in writing to the local planning authority for approval within one month of the discovery of such contamination.\r\nReason: Contamination is known or suspected on the site due to a former land use. It is therefore necessary to ensure that the development can be implemented and occupied with adequate regard for public and environmental safety.\r\nSupporting notes:\r\n(i)\tFurther remediation work to remove or manage additional contamination shall be carried out in accordance with the approved revised remediation method statement for verification and validation before the development is first brought into use. \r\n(ii)\tIn some instances, the local planning authority may require work on site to be ceased whilst the nature of additional contamination is investigated fully.\r\n(iii)\tThe Council requests that the revised remediation method statement or any site photos be sent electronically to landquality@hounslow.gov.uk as well as being submitted to the local planning authority for approval.",
    "Condition : 21 - Land quality - verification and validation of remedial work\r\nPrior to the development is first brought into use:\r\nThe agreed scheme for remediation, including any amendments, shall be fully implemented. A verification report produced upon completion of the remediation by a suitably qualified, experienced or supervised person shall be submitted in writing to the local planning authority for approval, before the development is first brought into use or in accordance with a programme approved in writing by the local planning authority.\r\nReason: Contamination is known or suspected on the site due to a former land use. It is therefore necessary to ensure that the development can be implemented and occupied with adequate regard for public and environmental safety.\r\nSupporting notes:\r\n(i)\tThe verification (closure) report shall revisit the conceptual site model and provide evidence that each aspect of the remediation plan has been implemented correctly and successfully in accordance with current UK guidance and best practice. Where applicable, the report shall describe how any additional/unexpected contamination encountered during development has been managed in line with the revised remediation method statement. \r\n(ii)\tThis report shall demonstrate that the development is suitable for its proposed use in terms of land quality.\r\n(iii)\tThe Council requests that the verification report or site photos be sent electronically to landquality@hounslow.gov.uk as well as being submitted to the local planning authority for approval.",
    "Condition : 22 - Land quality - long term monitoring and maintenance\r\nIf long term monitoring and maintenance is required following successful completion of approved remedial measures, reports which demonstrate the effectiveness of the monitoring and maintenance shall be prepared by a suitably qualified, experienced or supervised person and submitted to the local planning authority according to an agreed timescale as shall first have been approved under other conditions set out in this planning approval decision notice.\r\nThis shall be conducted in accordance with current UK guidance and best practice.\r\nReason: In order to ensure that risks from land contamination to the future users of the land and neighbouring land are minimised, together with those to controlled waters, properties and ecological systems.",
    "Condition : 23 - Development shall be carried out in strict accordance with the Written scheme of investigation approved on 14/01/2025 under planning reference P/2024/3898.\r\nReason: To safeguard the archaeological interest on this site\r\n",
    "Condition : 24 - a) The cumulative measured or calculated rating level of noise emitted from the mechanical services plant including heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) to which this permission refers, shall be 10dB(A) below the existing background noise level, at all times that the plant operate. The measured or calculated noise levels shall be determined at the boundary of the nearest ground floor noise sensitive premises or one metre from the facade of the nearest first floor (or higher) noise sensitive premises, and in accordance to the latest British Standard 4142. An alternative position for assessment/measurement may be used to allow ease of access, this must be shown on a map and noise propagation calculations detailed to show how the design criteria are achieved. \r\n\r\nb) The plant shall be isolated on adequate proprietary anti-vibration mounts to prevent the structural transmission of vibration and regenerated noise within adjacent or adjoining premises, and these shall be so maintained thereafter.   \r\n\r\nc) Following installation of any mechanical services plant including heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) to which the application refers, a post completion noise assessment shall be submitted for approval to the local planning authority which demonstrates the actual measured rating level of plant operating under normal conditions. All measurements shall be made in accordance with the methodology of BS4142: 2014 (Methods for rating and assessing industrial and commercial sound) and/or its subsequent amendments. The post completion report shall be both completed and submitted to the local authority within 28 days of completion of the installation for review. If the plant fails to meet the specified standard, remedial measures shall be put in place immediately and the noise assessment shall be carried out again.  This shall be repeated until the assessment has reached the required standard.  Once achieved, the plant shall be maintained permanently ther"
