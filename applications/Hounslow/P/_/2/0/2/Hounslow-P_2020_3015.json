Reduce crown height by two-three metres reduce crown spread by three-four metres\n\nRear of property:\n\nT2, T3 & T4: Sycamore - reduce small low branches overhanging pavement & road to give three and six metre clearance respectively. Remove all trunk growth of six metres. Remove ivy plant from trunk & crowns\n\nT6: Large Ash - Remove all ivy plant from trunk and crown, reduce extremities of low branches over the road to give  clearance of six metres. Reduce extremities of branches growing towards and over neighbouring property to give a clearance of two - 2.5 metres. Reduce crown back to previous reduction points leaving small furnishing were possible at cut points. Reduce large limb over road by three to four metres\n\nT8: Very Large Lime - remove trunk growth on garden side to a height of six metres. Maintain trunk growth on back side for screening. Reduce all new growth back to previous reduction points. Remove all major deadwood from crown.  \n\nT9: Sycamore - remove all trunk growth to a height of eight metres Remove all deadwood from crown\n\nT12: Very Large sycamore - remove all deadwood from crown, reduce large limb growing at 45 degrees and to the north east (over Cherry T15) by four to five metres.\n\nTrees in extension garden:\n\nT17: Lime - reduce crown height by four to five metres, reduce crown spread to balance and shape, remove all deadwood from crown\n\nG12: Seven Sycamores - remove small tree in south-east corner.  Other trees - sever ivy plant at the base and again at 0.5 metres and remove the cut section\n\nT25: Norway maple - reduce extremities of the branches growing towards the new building to give a clearance of one to 1.5 metres",
