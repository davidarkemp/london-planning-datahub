    "Reason : 1 - The proposal fails to comply with the terms of Article 3 of The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (Amendment) (England) Order 2015 as amended because: \r\nThe application site is no longer a single family dwelling and has been subdivided into two separate flats. Assessment of such a scheme under Schedule 2, Part 1, Class A of The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (Amendment) (England) Order 2015 is only limited to single family dwellinghouse, and does not extend to flats.\r\nIf the applicant wishes to carry out any enlargement to the existing property, a planning application must be made to the Local Planning Authority in this regard.\r\n"
