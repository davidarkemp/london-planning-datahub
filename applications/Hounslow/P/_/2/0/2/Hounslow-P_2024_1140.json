  "description": "Works to trees in a Conservation Area A line of four Carpinus betulus (Hornbeam) specimens planted 1.6m apart, presumably for boundary screening; probably pruned or pleached on at least one occasion to achieve this; however, no evidence of recent management noted; crowns suppressed and misshapen; #14 is dead, with one 50mm wide fungal fruiting body at base on E side; of low quality and value; of short-term potential. Fell and remove T12, T13, T15 and dead T14 to allow sunlight into the garden from this South boundary between the retained Mimosa trees T10 and T16 flanking each side of the hornbeams. Also enables no 20 garden to borrows the landscape view in neighbouring no 18 garden of Prunus and Eriobotrya trees. Replace with: 1 x multi stem small winter flowering tree Prunus x subhirtella 'Autumnalis Rosea??? 3-3.5m at planting, flowers early nectar source for bees. Planted away from the boundary inside the garden towards the South facing boundary. 3 x Crataegus prunifolia standard trees 3.5m H at planting good for bees and wildlife (flowers and berries). Replanted on the South facing boundary.",
