  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed dwelling would, because of its poor street presence and of it being an incongruous and inappropriate back-land development in a residential garden, cause harm to the character and appearance of the site and surrounding area, contrary to Local Plan policies SC1, CC1 and CC2 and the intent of NPPF Paragraph 71.",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed dwelling, by virtue of its inappropriate design, poor siting and in the absence of supporting Daylight and Sunlight Assessment, would fail to provide accommodation of acceptable quality by reason of poor outlook and failure to demonstrate acceptable levels of natural light within the two proposed bedrooms, and inadequate privacy and security within its proposed private amenity space. This would be contrary to Local Plan policies CC1, CC2, SC5 and the intent of the Housing Design Standards London Plan Guidance",
    "Reason : 3 - 3.\tThe proposed new dwelling, by virtue of its siting and excessive footprint, would harm the living conditions at nearby properties by reason of increased noise and disturbance to the main house at No.16 and the neighbours at No.12 Woodlawn Drive, and due to reasons of increased noise and disturbance, loss of privacy and overlooking to its neighbour at No.14 Woodlawn Drive. The inclusion of primary living accommodation in the form of a toilet in the proposed rear outbuilding would be contrary to policy and harmful to living conditions at neighbouring properties. Overall, the scheme would be contrary to Local Plan policies CC2, SC7 and the intent of the Residential Extension Guidelines."
