    "Condition : 1 - The proposed hip to gable conversion and rear roof extension, by virtue of their position, size, scale and design, would fail to respect the proportions of the host property, appearing bulky and incongruous additions, and would unbalance the appearance of the terrace. The proposed development would harm the character and appearance of the host property and wider street scene within Smallberry Avenue. The proposal is therefore contrary to Local Plan Policies CC1 (Context and Character), CC2 (Urban Design and Architecture) and SC7 (Residential Extensions and Alterations; the intent of the Residential Extension Guidelines."
