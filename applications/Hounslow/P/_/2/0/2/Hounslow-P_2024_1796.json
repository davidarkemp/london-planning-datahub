  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposal would provide self-contained residential units within the curtilage of existing houses, and would be in conflict with other Local Plan policies. The proposal would be unacceptable in principle and would fail to comply with Local Plan policy SC1 (Housing Growth).\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposal, by reason of its inappropriate scale, layout and design, would result in bulky and incongruous development that would fail to reflect character and appearance of the surrounding area. It is contrary to Local Plan policies CC1 (Context and character), CC2 (Urban design and architecture) SC1 (Housing Growth) and SC4 (Scale and intensity of new housing development) and London Plan Policies D4 (Delivering good design) and D6 (Housing quality and standards).",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposal would result in an overbearing and unneighbourly form of development that would harm 267 and 269 Vicarage Farm Road through loss of outlook and increased sense of enclosure, contrary to Local Plan Policy CC2 (Urban Design and Architecture) and SC4 (Scale and Density of New Housing Development). ",
    "Reason : 4 - The proposed development would fail to provide an acceptable standard of accommodation for the occupiers of the new dwellings by reason of inadequate external amenity space, contrary to Local Plan Policy SC5 (Ensuring suitable internal and external space).",
    "Reason : 5 - The applicant has failed to demonstrate that the proposal would not result in harm to highway and pedestrian safety, contrary to Local Plan policy EC2 (Developing a Sustainable Local Transport Network) and the Residential Crossovers and Off-Street Parking Policy.",
    "Reason : 6 - The submitted energy statement fails to demonstrate that the development would maximise energy savings at each step of the energy hierarchy. It is therefore contrary to Local Plan Policies EQ1 (Energy and Carbon Reduction) and EQ2 (Sustainable design and construction) and London Plan Policies SI2 (Minimising Greenhouse Gas Emissions)."
