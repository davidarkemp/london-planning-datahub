A, Energy Assessment prepared by Clearstream dated November 2022, Building Regulations Part L (BREL) Compliance Report, Thermal Bridging Report, Dwelling Sign-off SAP Report - received 9th November 2022.\r\n\r\nReason: In order to ensure the development is carried out in accordance with the planning permission.",
    "Condition : 3 - The materials to be used in the construction of the external surfaces of the development hereby permitted shall match those used in the existing building, unless otherwise shown on the approved plans.\r\n\r\nReason: In order to safeguard the appearance of the area.",
    "Condition : 4 - Notwithstanding the provisions of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development Order) 1995 (or any order revoking or re-enacting that order), no enlargement of the premises or any additional structures/buildings/enclosures within the curtilage of the site shall be carried out, other than as shown in the approved drawings, and no additional floor space shall be formed within the building(s) hereby permitted by means of internal horizontal division (new mezzanine level) without prior written approval of the local planning authority.\r\n\r\nReason: To protect neighbours' living conditions and the character and appearance of the area and to prevent over-intensive use of the site.",
    "Condition : 5 - Before the dwelling(s) hereby approved are first occupied, the developer shall provide to each dwelling a set of containers required at the time of development for household use for the storage and collection of recyclable materials for the purposes of the Council's kerbside recycling service, to the specification then in use by the local authority's recycling collection service and shall notify the Council's refuse and recycling services when the development is first occupied.  The waste and recyclable materials containers shall be stored in a proprietary refuse bin enclosure designed for the purpose to be supplied by the developer and located adjacent to each dwelling. Each dwelling with a private garden shall also be supplied with a garden waste composting bin of at least 220 litres capacity at the same time.\r\n\r\nReason: In order to protect the quality of the local environment and neighbours' living conditions and to endure appropriate means of refuse storage are provided",
    "Condition : 6 - Either side of the vehicle access hereby approved, visibility splay areas (the depth measured from the back of the footway and the widths outwards from the edges of the access, with a splay of at least 2.4 metres x 2.4 metres) shall be provided before the access and parking area is brought into use. These areas shall be kept clear of any obstructions to visibility greater than 600 mm in height, including shrubs, planting, boundary walls, fences, gates, other means of enclosure or other structures or objects at all times.\r\n\r\nReason: To ensure adequate visibility for drivers entering and leaving the site in the interests of pedestrian and vehicle safety",
    "Condition : 7 - Secure covered cycle parking facilities (for not less than two bicycles) for the occupants of, and visitors to, the development shall be installed in the rear garden of the site. The approved facilities shall conform to the current Westtrans West London Cycle Parking Guidance (or such other guidance as shall supersede it) in design and layout and be fully implemented and made available for use before the first occupation of the development or commencement of the approved use as appropriate and thereafter retained for use at all times without obstruction.\r\n\r\nReason: In order to support sustainable transport objectives.",
    "Condition : 8 - (a) The development hereby permitted shall be implemented in accordance with the approved Energy Strategy.\r\n\r\n(b) Prior to first occupation of any dwelling within the development hereby approved evidence (e.g. photographs, installation contracts and As-Built certificates under the Standard Assessment Procedure/National Calculation Method) shall be submitted to the local planning authority and approved in writing to show that the development has been constructed in accordance with the approved Energy Strategy, and any subsequent approved revisions, and achieved a 100% reduction in emissions.\r\n\r\n(c) Upon final commencement of operation of any low and zero carbon technologies, suitable devices for the monitoring of the low and zero carbon technologies shall have been installed, and the monitored data shall be submitted automatically to a monitoring web-platform at daily intervals for a period of three years from the point of full operation. The data shall be made available to the local planning authority on request for a period of five years.\r\n\r\nReason: In order to ensure that the development makes the fullest contribution to minimising carbon dioxide emissions.",
    "Condition : 9 - Prior to occupation of the development, hereby approved, the applicant shall enter into a binding agreement with the council to make an agreed contribution to the Council's Carbon Offset Fund, in accordance with the zero carbon strategy set out in the Energy Statement hereby approved to an amount that equates to any shortfall from zero carbon in the development as-built required to meet the 'zero carbon' target.\r\n\r\nReason: To ensure the development meets sustainability standards.",
    "Condition : 10 - (A) No development above ground level shall take place until details have been submitted to and approved by the local planning authority which demonstrate that:\r\n(i) At least three of the key elements of the building envelope (external walls, windows roof, upper floor slabs, internal walls, floor finishes/coverings) are to achieve a rating of A+ to D in the Building Research Establishment (BRE) The Green Guide of specification.\r\n(ii) At least 50% of timber and timber products are to be sourced from accredited Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) or Programme for the Endorsement of Forestry Certification (PEFC) scheme.\r\n(iii) No construction or insulation materials are to be used which would release toxins into the internal and external environment, including those that deplete stratospheric ozone.\r\n\r\n(B) The development shall not be occupied until evidence (e.g. photographs and copies of installation contracts) has been submitted to the local planning authority to demonstrate that the development has been carried out in accordance with the approved details under Part A of this condition. The development shall be maintained in accordance with the approved details at all times thereafter.\r\n\r\nReason: In the interests of sustainable development.",
    "Condition : 11 - Prior to first occupation of the building(s) hereby approved, the development shall have been constructed to achieve an internal water use of 105 litres/person/day or less.\r\n\r\nReason: In order to protect and conserve water supplies and resources."
