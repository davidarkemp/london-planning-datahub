    "Reason : 1 - The London Borough of Hounslow as the Local Planning Authority hereby certify that on 29/01/25, the proposal as shown on the drawing(s) submitted on 29/01/25 and numbered unnumbered all in one plans was not lawful within the meanings of Section 191 and 192 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990. \r\nThe development fails to comply with the terms of Class E, Clause(s) E.4 of Part 1 of Schedule 2 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended) because the proposal contains a bathroom - primary living accommodation - and the applicant has failed to demonstrate that the size of the outbuilding is a reasonable requirement for the intended uses. Therefore, the outbuilding would not be incidental to the enjoyment of the dwelling house.\r\n"
