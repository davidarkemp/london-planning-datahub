    "Reason : 1 - The proposal would fail to promote sustainable modes of transport and would result in conditions prejudicial to pedestrian and highway safety by virtue of the failure to provide visibility splays, the excessive width of the proposed crossover, and the location of the site on a busy road, near to a school. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to London Plan policy T6.1 and Local Plan policy EC2 and the Council's adopted Residential Crossover and Off-Street Parking Policy.",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposal would fail to provide any soft landscaping which would harm the character of the surrounding area contrary to Local Plan policy SC7 and GB7 and the intent of the Residential Extension Guidelines and the Council's Residential Crossover and Off-Street Parking policy."
