    "Reason : 1 - The existing outbuilding, given its inappropriate design, excessive size and position has detrimentally diminished the usable private amenity space, thereby causing unacceptable harm to the character of the host dwelling, the surrounding neighbourhood and the reduced amenity space would be to the detriment of the living conditions for both existing and future occupiers of the site. The scheme does not propose sufficient amendments to address these concerns. Therefore the proposal is contrary to Local Plan policies CC1 (Context and Character), SC7 (Residential Extensions and Alterations) and the Residential Extension Guidelines SPD.",
    "Reason : 2 - Given its excessive size and position, and the constrained rear amenity space of the application site and neighbouring properties and lack of sufficient amendments within the current application, the resultant single storey detached outbuilding would cause excessive harm to the living conditions of these neighbours at No. 11 Pontes Avenue and No.14 Old Farm Close, by loss of outlook and increased sense of enclosure and overbearing. Therefore the proposal is contrary to Local Plan policies CC2 (Urban Design and Architecture), SC7 (Residential Extensions and Alterations) and the Residential Extension Guidelines SPD."
