    "Condition : 1 - The development hereby permitted shall be begun before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.",
    "Condition : 2 - The proposed development shall be carried out in all respects in accordance with the proposals contained in the application and the plans submitted (2021-021-PD-001, 2021-021-PD-002, 2021-021-PD-003, 2021-021-PD-005, 2021-021-PD-006, 2021-021-PD-007 Received 23 August 2021; 2021-021-PD-004B Received 04 November 2021) therewith and approved by the Local Planning Authority, or as shall have been otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority before the building is used.",
    "Condition : 3 - No unit shall be occupied until space has been laid out within the site in accordance with approved plan no. 2021-021-PD-004B for 30 bicycles to be parked and that space shall thereafter be kept available for the parking of bicycles; photographic evidence shall be submitted to the Local Planning Authority upon completion as verification, prior to commencement of the use.",
    "Condition : 4 - Before the development hereby permitted is first occupied or brought into use, a Parking Management Plan shall first be submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority. This should include details of how parking in the site forecourt will be monitored, managed, and enforced, and how future provision will be secured (for delivery drivers only) if a need is identified. The development shall not be carried out otherwise than in accordance with the approved details and shall be maintained for the lifetime of the development, unless the prior written approval of the local planning authority is obtained to secure any variation",
    "Condition : 5 - Before the development hereby permitted is first occupied or brought into use, a Travel Plan in accordance with current Council and TfL guidance comprising immediate, continuing and long-term measures to promote and encourage a reduction in car use shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority. It should include robust initiatives to encourage sustainable travel and include SMART objectives for modal shift. The approved Travel Plan shall be implemented upon occupation, and thereafter monitored and reviewed in accordance with the agreed Travel Plan targets and timescales to the satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Condition : 6 - The use shall not commence until a secure storage area within the forecourt of the site has been enclosed by a two metre high close boarded fence to house not less than eight 1100 litre galvanised steel Eurobins, together with facilities for the separation and safe storage of glass, metal, plastics, cardboard, food waste and other recyclable materials which shall then be collected and taken to a suitable facility for recycling.\r\nThe storage area and bins shall be made permanently available before the development is first occupied and no waste shall be stored outside the site or other than in the designated area. The lids of the Eurobins shall be fixed shut at all times other than when waste is being emptied into them. Non-recyclable and perishable waste shall be removed from the site no less frequently than once a week.\r\nWaste shall be removed from the site to a suitable enclosed private storage area or an authorised refuse disposal or recycling site as soon as the bins become full if this is earlier than the time of the normal collection, unless additional covered and enclosed bins (as described above) have been provided and are thereafter made permanently available for the on-site storage of refuse and waste.\r\nAll delivery vehicles serving the restaurant unit shall access it and offload goods in the forecourt only and not from the public highway.",
    "Condition : 7 - a) The cumulative measured or calculated rating level of noise emitted from the mechanical services plant including heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) to which the application refers, shall be 10dB(A) below the existing background noise level, at all times that the mechanical system etc operates. The measured or calculated noise levels shall be determined at the boundary of the nearest ground floor noise sensitive premises or 1 meter from the facade of the nearest first floor (or higher) noise sensitive premises, and in accordance to the latest British Standard 4142; An alternative position for assessment /measurement may be used to allow ease of access, this must be shown on a map and noise propagation calculations detailed to show how the design criteria is achieved.\r\nb) The plant shall be isolated on adequate proprietary anti-vibration mounts to prevent the structural transmission of vibration and regenerated noise within adjacent or adjoining premises, and these shall be so maintained thereafter.\r\nc) Following installation of any mechanical services plant including heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) to which the application refers, a post completion noise assessment shall be submitted for approval to the local planning authority which demonstrates the actual measured rating level of plant operating under normal conditions. All measurements shall be made in accordance with the methodology of BS4142: 2014 (Methods for rating and assessing industrial and commercial sound) and/or its subsequent amendments. The post completion report shall be both completed and submitted to the local authority within 28 days of completion of the installation for review.",
    "Condition : 8 - Operation of the site shall only be carried out in accordance with information provided in the Deliveroo Operational Management Plan, reference OMP00738804.",
    "Condition : 9 - The use hereby approved shall not operate, receive deliveries, have waste collected or undertake maintenance of the premises outside of the designated operating hours of 08:00 to 24:00 Monday to Sunday and on public holidays and Deliveroo Riders shall only access the site for deliveries between the hours of 12:00 to 23:00 Monday to Sunday and on public holidays without the prior written permission of the Local Planning Authority.
