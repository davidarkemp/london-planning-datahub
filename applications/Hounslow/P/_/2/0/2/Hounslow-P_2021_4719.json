The site shall be investigated by a competent person to identify the extent and nature of contamination. The report should include a tiered risk assessment of the contamination based on the proposed end use of the site.  Additional investigation may be required where it is deemed necessary.\r\nb.\tIf required, a scheme for decontamination of the site shall be submitted to the Local Planning Authority, for written approval.  The scheme shall account for any comments made by the Local Planning Authority before the development hereby permitted is first occupied.\r\n   During the course of the development:\r\nc.\tThe Local Planning Authority shall be notified immediately if additional contamination is discovered during the course of the development. A competent person shall assess the additional contamination, and shall submit appropriate amendments to the scheme for decontamination in writing to the Local Planning Authority for approval before any work on that aspect of development continues.  \r\n   Before the development is first brought into use:\r\nd.\tThe agreed scheme for decontamination referred to in clauses b) and c) above, including amendments, shall be fully implemented and a written validation (closure) report submitted to the Local Planning Authority for approval. \r\n",
