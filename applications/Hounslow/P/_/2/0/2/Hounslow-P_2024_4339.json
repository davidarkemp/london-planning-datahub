    "Reason : 1 - The proposed infill extension, by reason of its excessive depth, height and position close to the boundaries of the site, would be intrusive and unneighbourly addition, out of scale and character with this and neighbouring dwellings, causing harm to neighbours living conditions as well as having an adverse effect on the visual amenities of the locality and the wider conservation area. Thus, it is contrary to the Council's Residential Extensions Guidelines 2024, Local Plan policies SC7, CC1, CC2 and CC4, policies D4 and HC1 of London Plan and the National Planning Policy Framework.",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed window replacement, because of insufficient details submitted would fail to ensure no compromising of the character and appearance of the property and the wider conservation area. Thus, it is contrary to the Council's Residential Extensions Guidelines 2024, Local Plan policies SC7, CC1, CC2 and CC4, policies D4 and HC1 of London Plan and the National Planning Policy Framework."
