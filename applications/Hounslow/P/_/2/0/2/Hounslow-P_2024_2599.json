    "Reason : 1 - Given its excessive scale and size, and inappropriate roof design above both the main house and the proposed two storey side extension, it is considered that the proposed development would be uncharacteristically large and disproportionate, and would fail to remain subservient to the original dwelling. The proposed scheme would result in an obtrusive and incongruous development which would cause harm to the character and visual appearance of the main house, the existing streetscene and surrounding area. This would be contrary to policies CC1 (Context and Character), SC7 (Residential Extensions and Alterations) of the adopted Local Plan (2015) and the intentions of the adopted Residential Extension Guidelines SPD. ",
    "Reason : 2 - Given the site's location, the proposed scheme would result in an overprovision of car parking spaces. This would run contrary to the London Plan Policy T6.1, Local Plan Policy EC2 (Developing a sustainable local transport network) and the Residential Crossovers and Off-Street Parking Policy."
