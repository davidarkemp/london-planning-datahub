    "Reason : 1 - The proposal by reason of its position, size, design and appearance, would be intrusive alterations, out of scale and character with this and neighbouring dwellings, as well as having an adverse effect on the visual amenities of the locality. Thus, it is contrary to Local Plan policies SC7, CC1 and CC2 of Local Plan, policies of London Plan and the National Planning Policy Framework.",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed front extension and erection of three front roof extensions, by reason of position, size, and width would lead to a loss of light and outlook to the neighbouring properties. Thus, it is contrary to Local Plan policies SC7, CC1 and CC2 of Local Plan, policies of London Plan and the National Planning Policy Framework."
