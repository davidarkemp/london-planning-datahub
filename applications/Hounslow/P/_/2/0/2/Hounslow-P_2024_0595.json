A competent person shall assess the contamination, where necessary, including soil and groundwater sampling and testing before any further part of the development that may be affected by the additional contamination that has been discovered continues. \r\n\r\nA revised remediation method statement, prepared by a suitably qualified, experienced or supervised person, shall be submitted in writing to the local planning authority for approval within one month of the discovery of such contamination. \r\n\r\nReason: Contamination is known or suspected on the site due to a former land use. It is therefore necessary to ensure that the development can be implemented and occupied with adequate regard for public and environmental safety.\r\n\r\nSupporting notes:\r\n\r\n(i)\tFurther remediation work to remove or manage additional contamination shall be carried out in accordance with the approved revised remediation method statement for verification and validation before the development is first brought into use. \r\n(ii)\tIn some instances, the local planning authority may require work on site to be ceased whilst the nature of additional contamination is investigated fully.\r\n(iii)\tThe Council requests that the revised remediation method statement or any site photos be sent electronically to landquality@hounslow.gov.uk as well as being submitted to the local planning authority for approval.",
    "Condition : 21 - Land quality - verification and validation of remedial work\r\n\r\nPrior to the development is first brought into use:\r\n\r\nThe agreed scheme for remediation, including any amendments, shall be fully implemented. A verification report produced upon completion of the remediation by a suitably qualified, experienced or supervised person shall be submitted in writing to the local planning authority for approval, before the development is first brought into use or in accordance with a programme approved in writing by the local planning authority. \r\n\r\nReason: Contamination is known or suspected on the site due to a former land use. It is therefore necessary to ensure that the development can be implemented and occupied with adequate regard for public and environmental safety.\r\n\r\nSupporting notes:\r\n\r\n(i)\tThe verification (closure) report shall revisit the conceptual site model and provide evidence that each aspect of the remediation plan has been implemented correctly and successfully in accordance with current UK guidance and best practice. Where applicable, the report shall describe how any additional/unexpected contamination encountered during development has been managed in line with the revised remediation method statement. \r\n(ii)\tThis report shall demonstrate that the development is suitable for its proposed use in terms of land quality.\r\n(iii)\tThe Council requests that the verification report or site photos be sent electronically to landquality@hounslow.gov.uk as well as being submitted to the local planning authority for approval.",
    "Condition : 22 - Land quality - long term monitoring and maintenance\r\n\r\nIf long term monitoring and maintenance is required following successful completion of approved remedial measures, reports which demonstrate the effectiveness of the monitoring and maintenance shall be prepared by a suitably qualified, experienced or supervised person and submitted to the local planning authority according to an agreed timescale as shall first have been approved under other conditions set out in this planning approval decision notice. \r\n\r\nThis shall be conducted in accordance with current UK guidance and best practice. \r\n\r\nReason: In order to ensure that risks from land contamination to the future users of the land and neighbouring land are minimised, together with those to controlled waters, properties and ecological systems.",
    "Condition : 23 - No demolition or development shall take place until a written scheme of investigation (WSI) has been submitted to and approved by the local planning authority in writing. For land that is included within the WSI, no demolition or development shall take place other than in accordance with the agreed WSI, which shall include the statement of significance and research objectives, and \r\nA.  The programme and methodology of site investigation and recording and the nomination of a competent person(s) or organisation to undertake the agreed works \r\nB.  Where appropriate, details of a programme for delivering related positive public benefits\r\nC.  The programme for post-investigation assessment and subsequent analysis, publication & dissemination and deposition of resulting material. This part of the condition shall not be discharged until these elements have been fulfilled in accordance with the programme set out in the WSI\r\nNote: The written scheme of investigation will need to be prepared and implemented by a suitably professionally accredited archaeological practice in accordance with Historic England's Guidelines for Archaeological Projects in Greater London. This condition is exempt from deemed discharge under schedule 6 of The Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015.\r\nReason: To safeguard the archaeological interest on this site\r\n"
