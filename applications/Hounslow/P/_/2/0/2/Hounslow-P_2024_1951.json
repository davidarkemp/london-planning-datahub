    "Reason : 1 - Owing to the excessive depth and siting of the proposed extension, it would result in an increased sense of enclosure and a significant loss of light and outlook to neighbouring occupiers. As a result, the proposal would have an unacceptable impact on these neighbours' living conditions and would be contrary both to Local Plan policies CC1, CC2 and SC7 and the guidance contained within the Residential Extension Guidelines SPD"
