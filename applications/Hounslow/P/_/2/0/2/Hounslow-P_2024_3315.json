    "Reason : 2 - 2.\tThe proposed boundary wall by reason of its inappropriate design, materials and height would be an overbearing and visually intrusive form of development resulting in harm to neighbours living conditions through a  loss of outlook contrary to Local Plan policies CC2, SC7 and the intent of the Residential Extension Guidelines.",
    "Reason : 3 - 3.\tThe proposed detached outbuilding, due to its size, scale, in an excessive form whilst appearing bulky and the inclusion of primary living accommodation which would fail to remain incidental to the enjoyment of the main house would have a negative impact on the character and appearance of the area, contrary to Local Plan policies CC1, CC2, SC7 and the intent of the Residential Extension Guidelines.",
