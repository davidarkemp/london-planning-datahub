    "Condition : 1 - The development hereby permitted shall begin not later than three years from the date of this decision.\r\n\r\nReason: In order to comply with Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990, as amended by Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004.",
    "Condition : 2 - The development hereby permitted shall be carried out in accordance with the following approved plans and specifications: [Air Conditioning unit Design and Technical Manual received 30/10/2024, PL3/SM/3289 � 01, PL3/SM/3289 � 02, PL3/SM/3289 - 03, Acoustic covering Installation manual received 11/12/2024, Email regarding material and finish of acoustic covering received 13/12/2024].\r\nReason: In order to ensure the development is carried out in accordance with the planning permission.",
    "Condition : 3 - A)\tThe cumulative measured or calculated rating level of noise emitted from the mechanical services plant (air conditioning) to which this permission refers, shall be 10dB(A) below the existing background noise level, at all times that the plant operate. The measured or calculated noise levels shall be determined at the boundary of the nearest ground floor noise sensitive premises or one metre from the facade of the nearest first floor (or higher) noise sensitive premises, and in accordance to the latest British Standard 4142. An alternative position for assessment/measurement may be used to allow ease of access, this must be shown on a map and noise propagation calculations detailed to show how the design criteria are achieved.\r\nB)\tThe air conditioning units shall be isolated on adequate proprietary anti-vibration mounts to prevent the structural transmission of vibration and regenerated noise within adjacent or adjoining premises, and these shall be so maintained thereafter.  \r\n\r\n\r\nReason: In order to protect neighbours' living conditions."
