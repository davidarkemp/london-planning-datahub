    "Reason : 1 - The London Borough of Hounslow as the Local Planning Authority hereby certify that on 14/08/2024 the proposal as shown on the drawing(s) submitted on 14/08/2024 and numbered Unnumbered Site Location Plan, unnumbered Proposed Block Plan and titled Proposed Caravan Floorplan, Elevations and Roof Drawings was not lawful within the meanings of Section 191 and 192 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990. \r\nThe proposal fails to comply with Section 13 (1)(b) of The Caravan Act as the scheme is considered not capable of being moved once constructed. Additionally the proposal constitutes 'development' within the meaning of Section 55 of the Town and Country Planning Act and further fails to comply with the terms of Article 3, Schedule 2, Part 1, Class E, Clause E(a) and E.1(e)(ii) of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended) because the outbuilding's purpose is not considered to be incidental to the enjoyment of the dwellinghouse and would exceed 2.5 metres in height within 2 metres of a boundary. \r\n"
