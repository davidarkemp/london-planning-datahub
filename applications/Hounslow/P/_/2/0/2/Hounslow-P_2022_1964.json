    "Condition : 1 - The application has failed to demonstrate how the proposal can be accommodated on the site without causing harm to the streetscene. The proposal therefore fails to comply with London Plan (2021) policies D3 and D4, Hounslow's Local Plan (2015) policies CC1 and CC2, coupled with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "Condition : 2 - 2.\tThe application has failed to demonstrate that the proposal would provide an acceptable standard of accommodation for future occupants, in particular the submitted material as part of the application indicates a development that would fail to meet the minimum internal space standards as set out in the Nationally described space standards (NDSS, 2015), fails to demonstrate residents would be adequately protected from outside noise, and fails to provide sufficient private and communal amenity space. The proposal therefore fails to comply with London Plan (2021) policy D6, Hounslow's Local Plan (2015) policy SC5; the London Plan Housing SPG (2016), coupled with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "Condition : 3 - The proposed development has failed to demonstrate that it would not result in unacceptable impacts upon the existing occupiers of neighbouring properties in terms of daylight/sunlight, outlook and noise disturbance. The proposed development has also failed to demonstrate that it would not result in the sterilisation of the adjoining site allocation by virtue of its scale and siting and resulting daylight/sunlight and outlook impacts and noise disturbance. The proposal therefore fails to comply with London Plan (2021) policies D6, D13 and D14, Hounslow's Local Plan (2015) policies CC2, SC4, EQ5 and IMP2 and Paragraph 130 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "Condition : 4 - The application has failed to demonstrate that the proposal would provide suitable environmental conditions, including failing to demonstrate that the proposal would maximise carbon reductions either during the construction or occupation phases of the development, minimise air pollution, sufficiently address any possible land contamination, or provide suitable SUDs. The proposal therefore fails to comply with London Plan (2021) policies SI1, SI2, SI12, S13, SD1 and Hounslow's Local Plan policies EQ1, EQ2, EQ3, EQ4 and EQ8, coupled with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "Condition : 5 - The proposed development would, in the absence of a completed legal agreement to secure necessary planning obligations, fail to secure necessary highway works and the provision of a comprehensive travel plan for the development, thereby failing to assist in limiting the use of the private car and contributing to the use of more sustainable modes of transport. This would be contrary to adopted Local Plan (2015) policy IMP3 and London Plan (2021) policy DF1 coupled with the requirements of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021)."
