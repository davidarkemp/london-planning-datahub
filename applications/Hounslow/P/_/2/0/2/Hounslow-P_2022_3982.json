    "Condition : 10 - Street Name and Numbering\r\nBefore the development hereby permitted is first occupied or brought into use, the Local Planning Authority shall be informed of the agreed naming and numbering of the proposed dwellings so that arrangements can be put in place to ensure that, with the exception of a person eligible for a disabled person's badge issued pursuant to section 21 of the Chronically Sick and Disabled Persons Act 1970 (or similar legislation), no resident of the development shall obtain a resident's parking permit. Any occupiers of the approved development shall surrender any such permit wrongly issued or held.\r\n",
    "Condition : 11 - Noise Control \r\na) The cumulative measured or calculated rating level of noise emitted from the air source heat pumps to which this permission refers, shall be 10dB(A) below the existing background noise level, at all times that the plant operate. The measured or calculated noise levels shall be determined at the boundary of the nearest ground floor noise sensitive premises or one metre from the facade of the nearest first floor (or higher) noise sensitive premises, and in accordance to the latest British Standard 4142. An alternative position for assessment/measurement may be used to allow ease of access, this must be shown on a map and noise propagation calculations detailed to show how the design criteria are achieved. \r\n\r\nb) The plant shall be isolated on adequate proprietary anti-vibration mounts to prevent the structural transmission of vibration and regenerated noise within adjacent or adjoining premises, and these shall be so maintained thereafter.   \r\n\r\nc) Following installation of the air source heat pumps to which the application refers, a post completion noise assessment shall be submitted for approval to the local planning authority which demonstrates the actual measured rating level of plant operating under normal conditions. All measurements shall be made in accordance with the methodology of BS4142: 2014 (Methods for rating and assessing industrial and commercial sound) and/or its subsequent amendments. The post completion report shall be both completed and submitted to the local authority within 28 days of completion of the installation for review. If the plant fails to meet the specified standard, remedial measures shall be put in place immediately and the noise assessment shall be carried out again.  This shall be repeated until the assessment has reached the required standard.  Once achieved, the plant shall be maintained permanently thereafter to continue to meet the standard.\r\n"
