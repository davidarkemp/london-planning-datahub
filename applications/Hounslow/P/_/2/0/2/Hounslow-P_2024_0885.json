The development therefore causes harm to neighbours' living conditions and would be contrary to Local Plan Policies CC2 (Urban Design and Architecture) and SC7 (Residential Extensions and Alterations) and the intent of the Residential Extension Guidelines.",
    "Reason : 2 - 2.\tThe proposal by reason of its inappropriate size, scale and when combined with other extensions, would be an overbearing and visually incongruous form of development failing to remain subordinate to the main house harming its character and that of the wider area contrary to Local Plan Policies CC1 (Context and Character), CC2 (Urban Design and Architecture) and SC7 (Residential Extensions and Alterations) and the intent of the Residential Extension Guidelines."
