Lightly reduce limb above to balance if necessary.Final height will be unchanged and final spread will 8 meters. (T15) Common Lime reduce back to most recent reduction points - ensuring that all regrowth is carefully removed so as to ensure minimum damage to swollen reduction / pollard heads. Final height 14 meters and final spread  6 meters. ( T17) Common Lime -crown reduce to an approximate height of 14 - 15 metres - rebalancing laterals to form a smaller crown.final spread  6 meters.
