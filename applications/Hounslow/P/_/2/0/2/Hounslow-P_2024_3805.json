    "Reason : 1 - The London Borough of Hounslow as the Local Planning Authority hereby certify that on 14/11/2024, the proposal as shown on the drawing(s) submitted on 14/11/2024 and numbered 2024/181-01, 2024/181-02, 2024/181-03, 2024/181-04, 2024/181-05 was not lawful within the meanings of Section 191 and 192 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990. \r\nThe development fails to comply with the terms of Article 3, Schedule 2, Part 1 of The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended) because the application site and its curtilage is not a single family dwellinghouse, but rather comprises two single family dwellinghouses on the same site,  and would therefore not constitute Permitted Development. \r\n"
