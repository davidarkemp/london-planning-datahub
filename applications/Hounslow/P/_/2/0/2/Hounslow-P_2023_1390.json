    "Reason : 1 - The proposal, because of the nature and scale of the use in this location, would undermine the hierarchy of town centres in the borough. Thus, it fails to promote sustainable development and is contrary to Policies SD6, SD7 of the London Plan and Policies TC2, TC3 of the Local Plan.",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposal, by reason of its insufficient details submitted with this application because they fail to show materials to be used in this building, would likely to be an intrusive development as without these details this Council is unable to fully assess the application and proposal cannot be considered to satisfy the requirements of policies CC1, CC2 of the Local Plan and policy D4 of London Plan. ",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposal, would have a serious and adverse effect on the amenity enjoyed by occupants of neighbouring properties in particular and the surrounding area generally, by reason of noise, disturbance, general pedestrian and vehicular activity at and within the vicinity of the site as well as loss of amenity space for upper floor flats contrary to policies SC5, CC1, CC2 of the Local Plan and policies D6 and D14 of the London Plan. ",
    "Reason : 4 - The proposal, due to the poor access, lack of functional arrangements for vehicular and pedestrians and failure to demonstrate that vehicle trip generation can be adequately managed, would lead to an unsatisfactory development and prejudice safe functioning of this access road and would be detrimental to the safety of both vehicles and pedestrians. contrary to policies EC1 and EC2 of the Local Plan and policies T1, T2, T3 and T4 of London Plan.
