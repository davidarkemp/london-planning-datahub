    "Condition : 8 - (a) No development (except any demolition, site clearance, ground investigation and remediation work) shall take place until a finalised Energy Strategy (demonstrating how the targets for carbon dioxide emissions reduction are to be met in line with the Mayor's energy hierarchy) has been submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority.\r\n(b) The development shall be implemented in accordance with the approved Energy Strategy and shall not commence above ground until full Design Stage calculations under the [Standard Assessment Procedure/National Calculation Method] have been submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority to show that the development will be constructed in accordance with the approved Energy Strategy, or any subsequent approved revisions.\r\nReason: In order to ensure that the development makes the fullest contribution to minimising carbon dioxide emissions.",
    "Condition : 9 - No development shall take place until the applicant has entered into a binding arrangement with the Council to make an agreed contribution to the Council's Carbon Offset Fund, in accordance with the zero carbon strategy set out in the Energy Statement hereby approved to an amount that equates to the shortfall in required energy savings to meet the 'zero carbon' target.\r\nReason: In order to ensure the development meets sustainability standards. ",
    "Condition : 10 - (A) No development above ground level shall take place until details have been submitted to and approved by the local planning authority which demonstrate that:\r\n(i)\tAt least three of the key elements of the building envelope (external walls, windows roof, upper floor slabs, internal walls, floor finishes/coverings) are to achieve a rating of A+ to D in the Building Research Establishment (BRE) The Green Guide of specification.\r\n(ii)\tAt least 50% of timber and timber products are to be sourced from accredited Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) or Programme for the Endorsement of Forestry Certification (PEFC) scheme.\r\n(iii)\tNo construction or insulation materials are to be used which would release toxins into the internal and external environment, including those that deplete stratospheric ozone.\r\n(B) The development shall not be occupied until evidence (e.g. photographs and copies of installation contracts) has been submitted to the local planning authority to demonstrate that the development has been carried out in accordance with the approved details under Part A of this condition. The development shall be maintained in accordance with the approved details at all times thereafter.\r\nReason: In the interests of sustainable development.",
    "Condition : 11 - Prior to first occupation of the building(s) hereby approved, the development shall have been constructed to achieve an internal water use of 105 litres/person/day or less.\r\nReason: In order to protect and conserve water supplies and resources.",
    "Condition : 12 - Land quality - landfill gas monitoring/ ground gas protection measures (small developments)\r\n\r\nEITHER\r\n\r\n(a) No development shall take place until the site has been investigated for landfill gas in accordance with current UK guidance and best practice. Details of the monitoring results and any gas protection measures required to render the development safe shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority. \r\n\r\nApproved remediation measures, if applicable, shall be incorporated into the development and evidence of which shall be submitted to the local planning authority in writing for approval before the development is first occupied. \r\n\r\nOr\r\n\r\n(b) The applicant may install gas protection measures incorporated into the development in accordance with a minimum of a Characteristic Situation 2 or equivalent specification before the development is first occupied. Photographic evidence of implementation and certification of Building Regulations inspection to demonstrate that the measures have been installed to comply with this specification shall be submitted to the local planning authority in writing for approval before the development is first brought into use. \r\n\r\nReason: The site lies on, or in close proximity to, a former landfill site and the local planning authority wishes to ensure that the site be developed and occupied with adequate regard for environmental and public safety. \r\n\r\nSupporting notes:\r\n(i)\tThe Council does not provide a landfill gas monitoring service, but environmental consultancies can be employed to undertake this work.\r\n(ii)\tThe term 'Characteristic Situation' describes the level of risk posed by ground gas to a specific site. A score from 1 to 6 is allocated, where 1 is the lowest risk and 6 the greatest. \r\n(iii)\tIn the case of small developments or extensions, it is often believed to be cheaper to install basic gas protection (at a minimum of Characteristic Situation 2 or equivalent) as a precautionary measure.
