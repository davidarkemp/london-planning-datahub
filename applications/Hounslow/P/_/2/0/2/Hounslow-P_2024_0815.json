    "Reason : 1 - The proposed advertisement, by virtue of its excessive size, scale, positioning and design would introduce visual clutter which would harm the character, appearance and pedestrian experience of this section of the public streetscene. The proposal is therefore contrary to Local Plan policies CC1 (Context and Character), CC4 (Heritage), CC5 (Advertisement Panels, Hoardings and Structures), and the intent of the NPPF.",
    "Reason : 2 - The applicant has failed to demonstrate that the proposal, due to its inappropriate size, scale, location and design, would not result in undue harm to the existing living conditions of its neighbours, notably 801 Bath Road. It would therefore be contrary to Local Plan policy CC2 (Urban Design and Architecture), CC5 (Advertisement Panels, Hoardings and Structures), and the intent of the NPPF."
