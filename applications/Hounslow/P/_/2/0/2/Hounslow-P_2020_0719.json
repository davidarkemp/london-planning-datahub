    "Condition : 3 - The proposed development shall be carried out in all respects in accordance with the proposals contained in the application and the plans submitted (Unnumbered Site Location Plan, 02 and 03) therewith and approved by the Local Planning Authority, or as shall have been otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority before the building is used.",
    "Condition : 4 - No fans, louvres, ducts or other external plant shall be installed without the prior approval of the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Condition : 5 - The use hereby permitted for A3 (Cafe) proposes shall not be open to customers outside the following times: 8:00 am to 12:00 am Monday to Saturday and 08:00 am to 11:00 pm on Sundays and Bank Holidays and no staff business or customer activity shall take place after 12 am on any day or before 10 am the following day other than activities necessary for the premises to be vacated and secured.",
    "Condition : 6 - There shall be no deliveries of food, equipment or other business materials to the premises and no collection of refuse waste or recyclable materials from the premises except between the hours of 07:00 am to 22:00 pm Monday to Saturday and 10:00 am to 18:00 pm on Sundays and Public Holidays.  \r\n",
    "Condition : 7 - No development shall commence until full details (including manufacturers' specifications) of secure covered cycle parking facilities for the occupants of, and visitors to, the development have been submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority. The approved facilities shall conform to current guidance such as the TfL London Cycling Design Standards in design and layout and be fully implemented and be made available for use before the first occupation of the development and thereafter retained for use at all times without obstruction. \r\n\r\n",
    "Condition : 8 - The use hereby approved shall not commence until a secure storage area within the rear yard of the site enclosed by a two metre high close-boarded fence to house not less than two 1100 litre galvanised steel Eurobins has been identified and made available, together with facilities for the separation and safe storage of glass, metal, plastics, cardboard, food waste and other recyclable materials which shall then be collected and taken to a suitable facility for recycling. The storage area and bins shall be made permanently available before the development is first occupied and no waste shall be stored outside the site or other than in the designated area. The lids of the Eurobins shall be fixed shut at all times other than when waste is being emptied into them. Non-recyclable and perishable waste shall be removed from site no less frequently than once a week. Waste shall be removed from the site to a suitable enclosed private storage area or an authorised refuse disposal or recycling site as soon as the bins become full if this is earlier than the time of the normal collection, unless additional covered and enclosed bins (as described above) have been provided and are thereafter made permanently available for the on-site storage of refuse and waste. The gates to the fence shall be kept shut when not in use.\r\n"
