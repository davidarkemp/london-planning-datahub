  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposal, due to its size, design and positioning, would result in an incongruous and uncharacteristic addition to the street scene, causing harm to its character and failing to comply with adopted Local Plan Policies CC1 (Context and Character) and CC2 (Urban Design and Architecture).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposal by virtue of its size, design and relationship to neighbours would harm the living conditions of the non-adjoining neighbour, 19 Pacific Close through a loss of outlook and increased sense of enclosure. The proposal would also harm the living conditions of the block of flats to the South through a loss of privacy & overlooking. Thus making it contrary to adopted Local Plan Policies CC1 (Context and Character), CC2 (Urban Design and Architecture) and SC7 (Residential Extensions and Alterations).",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposal by virtue of its design would result in a poor quality of accommodation for future occupiers due to the privacy & overlooking issues raised in addition to the substandard private amenity space provided. Thus making it contrary to adopted Local Plan Policies CC1 (Context and Character), CC2 (Urban Design and Architecture), SC5 (Ensuring Suitable Internal and External Space).",
    "Reason : 4 - The proposal would result in an overprovision of off-street parking and it has not been demonstrated that the loss of the existing off-street parking spaces would not have a detrimental impact upon the parking conditions and therefore highway safety in the area. Further, as no dedicated pedestrian access has been provided the proposal is contrary to Policy EC2 (Developing a Sustainable Local Transport Network) of the Local Plan together with the adopted Residential Crossovers and Off-street Parking Policy and the London Plan Policy T6.1.\r\n"
