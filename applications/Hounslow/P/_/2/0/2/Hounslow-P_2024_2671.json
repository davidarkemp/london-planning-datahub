  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The subject property is not located within convenient walking distance of town centre facilities, and is not located within an area with good public transport links. The proposal is therefore unacceptable in principle, contrary to Local Plan policy SC10 and the Houses in Multiple Occupation SPD.",
    "Reason : 2 - The original property is less than 130 square metres in area, and therefore fails to meet the minimum size threshold to be considered suitable for conversion. The proposal is therefore unacceptable in principle, contrary to Local Plan policy SC10 and the Houses in Multiple Occupation SPD.",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed extensions by reason of their excessive scale, size and inappropriate design would fail to remain subordinate to the main house harming its character and that of the surrounding area contrary to Local Plan policies CC1, CC2, SC7 and the intent of the Residential Extension Guidelines. ",
    "Reason : 4 - The applicant has failed to demonstrate that the proposal would not result in increased disturbance to residents of neighbouring properties contrary to Local Plan polices CC2 and SC10 and the Houses in Multiple Occupation SPD.",
    "Reason : 5 - The proposal single storey rear extension by reason of its excessive depth and position on the boundary would result in loss of light, overshadowing and loss of outlook to 219 Great West Road harming their living conditions contrary to Local Plan policies CC2, SC7 and the intent of the Residential Extension Guidelines. ",
    "Reason : 6 - The proposal would fail to provide adequate waste and recycling facilities, contrary to Local Plan policies SC10 and EQ7 and the Houses in Multiple Occupation SPD and the Recycling and Refuse Guidance."
