The boundary treatment shall be completed before the buildings are occupied. Development shall be carried out in accordance with the approved details.",
    "Condition : 10 - Prior to commencement of the development hereby approved:\r\nNo development shall take place until a preliminary non-intrusive risk assessment to identify possible areas and sources of land contamination may exist on the site and to establish what site remediation measures or further intrusive investigation may be necessary before the development commences (Phase I desk study report), prepared by a suitably qualified, experienced or supervised person, has been submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority. \r\n",
    "Condition : 11 - Prior to commencement of the development hereby approved:\r\nFollowing the completion of the Phase I desk study report, if intrusive investigations or gas monitoring is recommended, a Phase II site investigation must be undertaken. No development other than necessary works to enable intrusive investigations shall take place until a Phase II site investigation report, prepared by a suitably qualified, experienced or supervised person, to identify the areas and sources of land contamination that exist on the site and to identify the likely scope of site remediation measures necessary before the development commences has been submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority. \r\nThe investigation shall be carried out by a competent person(s), based on the initial Conceptual Site Model (CSM) and on-site observations, to identify the extent and nature of contaminants. Additional investigations may be required where it is deemed necessary. The initial CSM shall be updated accordingly following a tiered risk assessment based on the findings of the investigation, and where applicable, the report shall include proposals to deal with the identified contamination on site. The investigation and the report must adhere to current UK guidance and best practice.\r\n",
    "Condition : 12 - Prior to commencement of the development hereby approved:\r\nIf a scheme for remediation is recommended in the Phase II site investigation for the site, no development shall take place until a remediation method statement prepared by a suitably qualified, experienced or supervised person to specify the works necessary to render the site fit for its proposed future use, has been submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority. \r\n",
