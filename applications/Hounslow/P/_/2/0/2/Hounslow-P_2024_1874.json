Therefore, works did not commence prior to the expiration of Planning Permission P/2021/0434 in accordance with Condition 1 (Three Year Time Limit), and the Planning Permission is therefore not extant, and to carry out the approved development in accordance with Planning Permission P/2021/0434 would therefore not be lawful.   \r\n"
