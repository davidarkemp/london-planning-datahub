    "Condition : 1 - The development hereby permitted shall be begun before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.",
    "Condition : 2 - TThe proposed development shall be carried out in all respects in accordance with the proposals contained in the application and the plans submitted (001, 050, 060, 110 & 120 dated 27 August 2021 and received 23 December 2021) therewith and approved by the Local Planning Authority, or as shall have been otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority before the building is used.",
    "Condition : 3 - The development shall be constructed using the materials shown in the Materials Schedule approved under planning decision reference 00553/42A/P5(2-5) - approved on 17 December 2018.  The site shall be landscaped and fenced in accordance with the drawing approved under planning decision reference 00553/42A/P5(2-5) - approved on 17 December 2018 no later than one planting season after completion of the building and shall be maintained in accordance with such thereafter. Any trees or plants that, within 5 years of planting, die, are cut down, uprooted, destroyed or become (in the opinion of the Local Planning Authority) seriously damaged or defective, shall be replaced with another tree or plant of the same size and species within the first planting season following its death, removal, uprooting or destruction, unless the Local Planning Authority gives its prior written approval to any variation.  The hard surfaces on the site shall be constructed of porous material and shall be so designed that no run-off from these areas leaves the site or enters the public surface water drainage system\r\n",
    "Condition : 4 - Notwithstanding the details shown on the approved plans, the development shall not be occupied until a secure, roofed cycle storage shed designed in accordance with the specifications set out in the Westtrans West London Cycle Parking Guidance (2017) to accommodate not less than two bicycles has been installed in the place of the car parking space furthest from the highway.  This car parking space shall not be provided, nor re-provided elsewhere on site.  No additional on-site car parking shall be provided other than the single space hereby approved and the cycle storage shall be retained permanently.\r\n",
    "Condition : 5 - No demolition or construction work shall take place on the site except between the hours of 8am to 6pm on Mondays to Friday and 9am to 1pm on Saturdays and none shall take place on Sundays and Public Holidays without the prior agreement of the Local Planning Authority.\r\nPrior to any demolition and construction work, neighbours shall be given details outlining construction timeframes (including when demolition and piling will take place).",
    "Condition : 6 - Notwithstanding the provisions of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development Order) 2015 (or any order revoking or re-enacting that order) no enlargement of the hereby approved development or any additional structures/buildings within the curtilage of the site shall be carried out other than not more than two garden sheds in the rear garden, not exceeding 2.5 metres in height and each not exceeding ten square metres in area, nor shall any hard surfaces be laid down that are non-porous unless they are so designed that no run-off from these areas leaves the site or enters the public surface water drainage system.\r\n",
    "Condition : 7 - Notwithstanding the information contained in the submitted Energy Statement, the development hereby permitted shall not be occupied until the developer has submitted to and received approval from the local planning authority for a revised Energy Statement including a proposal to install as many photovoltaic panels as can practicably be provided to appropriately facing and unshaded rooftops on the site and until the premises have been fitted with triple-glazed windows.  The Energy Statement so approved shall be implemented before the development is first occupied and the development shall not be occupied until the applicant has entered into a binding arrangement with the Council to make an agreed contribution to the Council's Carbon Offset Fund, in accordance with the zero carbon strategy set out in the Energy Statement hereby approved to an amount that equates to the shortfall in required energy savings to meet the 'zero carbon' target after implementation fo the agreed strategy.  Prior to first occupation of the house evidence (e.g. photographs, installation contracts and As-Built certificates under the Standard Assessment Procedure) shall be submitted to the Local Planning Authority and approved in writing to show that the development has been constructed in accordance with the approved Energy Strategy.\r\nUpon final commencement of operation of any low and zero carbon technologies, performance data for energy consumption must be submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority. The performance data shall be submitted every 18 months to a monitoring web-platform for a period of three years from the point of full operation.\r\n",
    "Condition : 8 - Prior to first occupation of the development hereby approved evidence (schedule of fittings and manufacturers literature) shall be submitted to the Local Planning Authority and approved in writing to show that the development has achieved an internal water use of 105 Litres per person per day or less.\r\n",
    "Condition : 9 - The development hereby approved shall not be occupied until evidence (e.g. photographs and copies of delivery notes, invoices or installation contracts) have been submitted to the Local Planning Authority to demonstrate that the development meets the following:\r\n\r\nAt least three of the key elements of the building envelope (external walls, windows roof, upper floor slabs, internal walls, floor finishes/coverings) are to achieve a rating of A+ to D in the Building Research Establishment (BRE) The Green Guide of specification.\r\n\r\nAt least 50% of timber and timber products are to be sourced from accredited Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) or Programme for the Endorsement of Forestry Certification (PEFC) scheme.\r\n\r\nNo construction or insulation materials are to be used which will release toxins into the internal and external environment, including those that deplete stratospheric ozone.\r\n",
    "Condition : 10 - Before any further work takes place on site, the developer shall carry out a survey of the condition of the highway and footway within 20 metres of the site to establish any pre-existing damage of the pavement and carriageway and shall submit the same to the Council's highways contractor with a ciopy to the local planning authority for information.\r\n\r\nDuring works, an appropriate wheel-washing system shall be operated to remove mud, stones and other extraneous materials from vehicle wheels and chassis' leaving the site, and all departing loads shall be fully covered to ensure no material is deposited on the highway. The exit from the wheel wash shall be a hard, non-porous surface sited as far away from the exit as is possible given the site constraints and kept clean at all times.  Waste water discharged from the wheel wash shall be stored and disposed of on site and not discharged into the public sewer unless soil, stones and any suspended material have first been removed.\r\n\r\nThe developer shall ensure that no dust or other debris is carried on to adjoining properties in accordance with the guidance at https://www.london.gov.uk/file/18750/download?token=zV3ZKTpP. \r\n\r\nSite lighting shall be designed, positioned and directed so as not to unnecessarily intrude on passing drivers or direct light into any neighbouring windows in accordance with the guidance provided by the Institute of Lighting Engineers Guidance Note: For The Reduction Of Obtrusive Light 2021.\r\n\r\nAll vehicle arrivals and departures shall be supervised and the condition of the highway examined immediately afterwards.  Any materials shed from the vehicle during such movement shall be immediately removed from the highway, and returned to site or carted away for disposal and shall not be washed into the surface water drainage system\r\n",
    "Condition : 11 - So far as this can be achieved on land owned by the developer, a splay of 2.4 metres x 2.4 metres shall be provided on each side of both of the approved  access, the depth measured from the back of the footway and the widths outwards from the edges of the access, and no fence, wall or other obstruction to visibility exceeding 0.6 metre in height above the surface of the adjoining highway shall be erected within the areas of such splays.",
    "Condition : 12 - Notwithstanding the details shown on the approved drawings050 and 110 dated 27 August 2021 and received 23 December 2021, prior to the first occupation of the hereby approved development the waste and recycling provision depicted on the drawing shall be installed adjacent to the street boundary in a location not less than 2.5 metres from the adjacent vehicle access.  The provision shall be made available for use before the house is first occupied and shall thereafter be retained as such, without obstruction, for the duration of the development.  The refuse bins shall be enclosed in a timber proprietary refuse store not exceeding 1.3 metre high, 1.5 metres wide and one metre deep"
