  "description": "The aim is to move the staircase to the side of the rear garden, thus creating a more efficient use of space outside and adding an additional room for a diner. The proposed extension would create additional space and provide more light with two privacy sky lights and one west/garden facing window. Existing north facing bathroom windows would be blocked off and a new small privacy window would be moved to face west to further increase light and air circulation. The proposed extension would be at 1.7m above ground floor level, flat roof and would be finished in white render to match the existing style of the building. The extension would be build to current building regulations. The proposed extension measurements would be approximately 4.7m x 5.7m, measured externally, which would leave about 1.7m space between boundary wall with 13 Bolton road, and leave 4m x 9m of usable garden space. The extension would be discrete and unobtrusive, 1.7m high from ground level, and create a better use of space, both inside and outside and provide further privacy to neighbouring apartments.",
