  "decision_conditions": [
    "Condition : 1 - This development must be completed before 30 May 2019.\r\n\r\nYou must notify the Council that you have completed the work no later than 21 days after doing so, giving the name of the developer, the address of the property where the extension is and the date of completion.\r\n\r\nThe materials used on the external surfaces of the development shall match those used in the building to which it is attached in terms of style, colour, texture and, in the case of brickwork, bonding, coursing and pointing.\r\n\r\nAll openable parts of any side windows in the extension shall be more than 1.7 metres above finished floor level and permanently retained as such.\r\nAny side windows shall be in obscure glazing and permanently retained as such.  Once built, no further side windows shall be installed\r\n",
    "Condition : 2 - Before the development hereby permitted commences the applicant must either:\r\na.\tInvestigate the site for landfill gas to the satisfaction of the LPA, to ascertain whether gas protection measures are required.  Where measures are required the details shall be submitted to, and approved by, the LPA.\r\nOr;\r\nb.\tThe applicant shall install gas protection measures as a precautionary measure without first investigating the site.  The details of these measures shall be submitted to, and approved by, the LPA.\r\nc.\tFor a. and b. all required measures shall be installed before the development is first occupied.\r\nReason:  The site lies on, or in close proximity to, a former landfill site and the Local Planning Authority wishes to ensure that the development does not give rise to any potential risk from landfill gas migration in accordance with policy EQ8 Contamination of the adopted Local Plan.\r\nSupporting notes:\r\na.  The Council do not provide a landfill gas monitoring service, but environmental consultancies can be employed to undertake this work.\r\nb.  In the case of small developments or extensions it is believed to be often cheaper to install basic gas protection as a precautionary measure.  However, please note that the level of protection required may vary depending on the nature of the site.  Further information is available from the Land Quality pages of the Council's website. \r\nc.  We request that site investigation reports or site plans be sent electronically to the address above or by post on a cd or dvd wherever possible."
