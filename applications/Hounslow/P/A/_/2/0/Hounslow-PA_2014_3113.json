    "Condition : 1 - The loss of the retail premise to a residential use would be detrimental to the character and viability of the key shopping parade. The change of use would decrease foot traffic within the locality which is considered to negatively impact the vitality of the shopping parade. It is undesirable for the building to change to a use falling within C3 (dwellinghouse) because of the impact on the sustainability of the shopping area. The development is therefore contrary to Schedule 2, Part 3, Class IA, condition IA.2.(1)(b)(iv)(bb) of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 1995 (as amended 2014)."
