    "Condition : 1 - The proposed development would not comply with Condition A.3(4)(a) of Schedule 2 Part 16 of the General Permitted Development Order as it requires prior approval and would, because of its siting and appearance, be an intrusive and unduly prominent development which would create  harmful overbearing impact on the occupiers of nearby residential properties. The proposal would also cause significant harm to the historic setting of the registered park and gardens at Chiswick House Grounds and the Grade I Listed heritage assets in the northern corner of these grounds, and would be out of scale and character with the wider Conservation Area. Thus, on the basis of the submitted Drawings/Equipment Schedules (002; 005; 006; 100; 150; 215; 265; 304; 307), Cover Letter, Site Specific Supplementary Information, Collaborating for digital connectivity ICNIRP Conformity Declaration and Developer's Notice and 5G and Health all received on  the 30/11/2021, the proposed development would be detrimental to the visual amenity of the locality and the appearance and character of the site, contrary to the NPPF and Local Plan policies CC1, CC2 and CC4."
