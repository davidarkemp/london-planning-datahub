    "Reason : 1 - The proposal fails to ensure the transport impacts of the development are adequately addressed, as there is no information suggesting that; 1) the building would have safe and step-free pedestrian access, 2) the existing and proposed trip predictions/ generations, 3) sufficient electric vehicle charging disabled person parking space and 4) satisfactory cycle parking area. The proposal would therefore be contrary to the terms of Schedule 2, Part 3, Class MA, Paragraph MA.2 (2)(a) of the Town and County Planning (General Permitted Development)(England) Order (2015)(as amended).",
    "Reason : 2 - he proposed development has failed to demonstrate the predicted internal ambient noise levels from commercial noise for windows closed/open scenarios during the daytime and night-time and the effectiveness of the proposed specifications for glazing, ventilation and building fabric would not harm the intended occupiers of the development. The proposal would therefore be contrary to the terms of Schedule 2, Part 3, Class MA, Paragraph MA.2 (2)(d) of the Town and County Planning (General Permitted Development)(England) Order (2015)(as amended)."
