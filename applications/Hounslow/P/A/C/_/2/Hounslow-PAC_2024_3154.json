    "Condition : 5 - Land quality � additional/unexpected contamination found during development\r\nDuring the development:\r\nThe Local Planning Authority shall be notified immediately if any land contamination not previously identified is encountered during development. A competent person shall assess the contamination, where necessary, including soil and groundwater sampling and testing before any further part of the development that may be affected by the additional contamination that has been discovered continues.\r\nA revised remediation method statement, prepared by a suitably qualified, experienced or supervised person, shall be submitted in writing to the local planning authority for approval within one month of the discovery of such contamination.\r\nReason: Contamination is known or suspected on the site due to a former land use. It is therefore necessary to ensure that the development can be implemented and occupied with adequate regard for public and environmental safety.\r\nSupporting notes:\r\n(i)\tFurther remediation work to remove or manage additional contamination shall be carried out in accordance with the approved revised remediation method statement for verification and validation before the development is first brought into use. \r\n(ii)\tIn some instances, the local planning authority may require work on site to be ceased whilst the nature of additional contamination is investigated fully.\r\n(iii)\tThe Council requests that the revised remediation method statement or any site photos be sent electronically to landquality@hounslow.gov.uk as well as being submitted to the local planning authority for approval.",
    "Condition : 6 - Land quality - verification and validation of remedial work\r\nPrior to the development is first brought into use:\r\nThe agreed scheme for remediation, including any amendments, shall be fully implemented. A verification report produced upon completion of the remediation by a suitably qualified, experienced or supervised person shall be submitted in writing to the local planning authority for approval, before the development is first brought into use or in accordance with a programme approved in writing by the local planning authority.\r\nReason: Contamination is known or suspected on the site due to a former land use. It is therefore necessary to ensure that the development can be implemented and occupied with adequate regard for public and environmental safety.\r\nSupporting notes:\r\n(i)\tThe verification (closure) report shall revisit the conceptual site model and provide evidence that each aspect of the remediation plan has been implemented correctly and successfully in accordance with current UK guidance and best practice. Where applicable, the report shall describe how any additional/unexpected contamination encountered during development has been managed in line with the revised remediation method statement. \r\n(ii)\tThis report shall demonstrate that the development is suitable for its proposed use in terms of land quality.\r\n(iii)\tThe Council requests that the verification report or site photos be sent electronically to landquality@hounslow.gov.uk as well as being submitted to the local planning authority for approval.",
