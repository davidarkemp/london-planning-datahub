  "description": "Erection of two additional floors above the existing second floor creating additional six flats (7 x 2 bed & 6 x 1bed) with associated works. The existing building height is 11.213 m. The proposed height would be 5.715 m. The total height when completed will be 16.928m. All in compliance with requirement. The proposed height will be below 18.0 m\nThe external appearance of the proposed building will be same as the existing. The extension would have the exacting material and finishes to match the existing including window frames,glazing & railings. As the layout of the proposed flats will be exactly the same as existing, there are no issues with adequate natural light in all habitable rooms.",
