    "Reason : 1 - The proposed two storey side extension, by reason of its siting in close proximity to southern boundary with the adjacent dwellings at No. 16 and 17 Daventer Drive, would appear highly intrusive, overbearing, would significantly increase the loss of outlook, natural light and enclosure to the detriment of the residential and visual amenities of the occupiers of these neighbouring properties. As such, the proposed development would be contrary to Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021) and Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and guidance contained in the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010)."
