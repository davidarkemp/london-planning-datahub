    "Reason : 1 - The proposed enlargements to the property by reason of their cumulative width and depth, overall scale and poor contrived design in conjunction with existing extensions to the original dwelling and its prominent siting, form a visually intrusive, inappropriate, unsympathetic and incongruous form of development that would constitute overdevelopment of the site and substantially harm the form and proportions of the original dwelling, the streetscene and the established and prevailing pattern of development in the locality, contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D3.D(1) and D3.D(11) of The London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013), and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document Residential Design Guide (2010)."
