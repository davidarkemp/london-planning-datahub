    "Reason : 1 - The proposed first floor side to rear extension by reason of its lack of set back from the site boundary in conjunction with its prominent corner siting, would result in a dominant and incongruous form of development and uncharacteristic loss of openness to the spatial setting of the locality, to the detriment of the character and appearance of the existing dwellinghouse, the streetscene and the established prevailing pattern of development in the area, contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies D3.D(1) and D3.D(11) of The London Plan (2021), Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 A, DM1 B (a), (b) and (c) of the Development Management Plan Local Policies (2013) and the Adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed part single part two storey side to rear extension by reason of its excessive combined width, depth, scale, bulk, mass  pertaining to its unacceptable wedge-shape design, expansive crown roof  and unduly shallow pitch in a prominent corner siting would introduce an incongruous, overly dominant and obtrusive form of development, that would fail to respect the proportions of the existing dwellinghouse and the character and appearance of the neighbouring properties, to the detriment of the character and appearance of the existing dwellinghouse and the surrounding area, contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policy D1.D(1) and (11) of The London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1 B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 3 - By reason of the fact that the site is located within an area of land liable to flooding, and insufficient information has been provided within the submitted Flood Risk Assessment to in relation to; compensatory flood storage, drainage strategy details and permeable paving, the applicant has failed to demonstrate that the proposed development would not exacerbate the risk of flooding within the site or increase the risk and consequences of flooding elsewhere. The proposal would thereby be contrary to the to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy SI 12 C and SI 13 of the London Plan (2021), Policy CS1.U and CS1.W of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM9 A (a), (b) and (c) and DM10 A, C and D of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013)."
