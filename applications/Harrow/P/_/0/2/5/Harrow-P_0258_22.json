    "Reason : 1 - The first floor side extension, by reason of its width and the resulting loss of the pre-existing separation gap between No. 117 and 115 Kingsley Road, its lack of set-back from the main front wall of the dwellinghouse, its awkward siting alongside the dwellinghouseï¿½s gable ended roof form, its failure to incorporate a sympathetic roof form, its failure to match the eaves height of the main dwelling, its awkward freestanding design with no ground floor level extension below, its stark contrast in materials to the existing first floor rear extension which it adjoins, and its use of unsympathetic black coloured window frames; results in an incongruous, discordant, contrived, unsympathetic and unduly prominent addition to the host dwelling and street scene, which appears unduly at odds with the established pattern of development within the area and detracts from the original spatial pattern of dwellinghouses along the road. The proposal would therefore be contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies D3.D(1) and D3.D(11) of The London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 A., DM1 B. (a), (b) and (c) of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).\r\n"
