    "Reason : 1 - Within the context of the planning permission P/3922/21 dated 02/12/2021, the proposed development would be different in its massing, overall footprint, and the combined extent and scale of fenestration changes to the development would result in a material change to the character and appearance of the host dwelling, street scene and wider area, and would also result in a material change in impact on the residential amenities of adjoining neighbours. It would therefore require re-consultation of neighbouring properties, and the proposal would need to be re-assessed against the requirements of Policy D3 of The London Plan (2021) and Policy DM1 of the Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010). The proposal is therefore not considered to be non-material minor amendment."
