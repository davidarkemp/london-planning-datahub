    "Reason : 1 - The proposed first floor side extension, in conjunction with the existing hip to gable end roof extension, by reason of its poor and incompatible design, would give rise to an unsympathetic, incongruous, bulky and obtrusive form of development which would fail to respect the character, composition and design of the host dwelling and neighbouring properties and would significantly detract from the established and prevailing pattern of development in the area, to the detriment of the character and appearance of the subject dwellinghouse and the street scene, contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021),  Policy D3 D (1) and (11) of the London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010)."
