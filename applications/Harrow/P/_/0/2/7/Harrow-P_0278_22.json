    "Reason : 1 - The development would result in the loss of community facilities and has failed to provide sufficient evidence to justify or replace this loss in accordance with the relevant policies. In addition, the continued use of the site could prejudice future use of the community centre, by reason of the loss of the use of the parking lot area. Accordingly, it is considered that the development is contrary to Policy CS1.Z of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012) and Policies DM1.E and DM47 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013).\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The hoarding and gates along the boundary of the development, by reason of their height, poor quality and unsympathetic design, are considered to be out of keeping with the character and appearance of the area and would be detrimental to real or perceived crime and security of the site and area. Accordingly, it is considered that the development is contrary to Policies D3 (D(1), D(5), D(6) and D(11)) and D11 of The London Plan (2021), Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012) and Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013).\r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - Insufficient information regarding the traffic, highways, parking and servicing impacts of the development, including the use of the proposed access to the adjacent London distributor road (Kenton Road), has been provided to allow the local planning authority to fully assess the functionality and safety of the development. In the absence of such information, the development has failed to demonstrate compliance with policies T4, T6 and T7 of The London Plan (2021), and policies DM42, DM43, DM44 and DM45 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013).\r\n",
    "Reason : 4 - Insufficient information has been provided regarding surface and foul water infrastructure and disposal, and regarding the potential impacts and mitigation of any contaminants on site or displaced onto adjacent land. In the absence of such information, it is considered that insufficient information has been provided to demonstrate that the development complies with Policies DM10 and DM15 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013).\r\n"
