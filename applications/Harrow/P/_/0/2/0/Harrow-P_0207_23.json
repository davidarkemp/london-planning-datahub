    "Reason : 1 - The proposed outbuilding by reason of its excessive scale, together with the absence of any justification for the necessity of the excessive large scale of the outbuilding for the uses proposed, on the balance of probabilities would not be for purposes incidental to the enjoyment of the dwellinghouse as such. The proposal is therefore not within the tolerances set out in Schedule 2 Part 1 Class E of The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 as amended.\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed outbuilding would include the construction or provision of a verandah.
