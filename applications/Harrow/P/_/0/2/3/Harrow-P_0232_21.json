    "Reason : 1 - The proposed first floor extension, by reason of its siting, inappropriate design, contrived roof arrangement and proposed columns at ground floor level would have an obtrusive and conspicuous appearance, resulting in an unsympathetic extension, at odds with the appearance of the host property and the prevailing character of the area, that would unacceptably harm the character and appearance of the host building and the surrounding area, contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies D3.D(1) and D3.D(11) of The London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013), and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed first floor side to rear extension, in conjunction with the proposed outbuilding, existing extension and canopy link, by reason of poor design and cumulative scale would result in excessive bulk, scale, and massing which would wholly subsume the proportions of the original dwellinghouse and would be harmful to the character and appearance of the host dwelling and the wider area, contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policies D3 (D(1) and D(11)) of The London Plan (2021), Policy CS1.B on the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 of the Development Management Local Plans Policies (2013) and Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010)."
