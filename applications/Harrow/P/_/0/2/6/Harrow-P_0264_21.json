    "Reason : 1 - For all the reasons considered, and weighing up the development plan policies and proposals, and other material considerations including comments received in response to notification and consultation as set out in the officer report, this application is recommended for refusal.\r\n\r\nInsufficient information has been submitted in relation to conditions 4 (disposal of sewage), Condition 5 (disposal of surface water), Condition 9 (Levels), and Condition 11 (permeable paving), to demonstrate to the Local Planning Authority that the proposal would ensure the works are carried out at suitable levels in the interests of adjacent neighbours, the appearance of the development, drainage, gradient of access and future highway improvement, and to ensure that adequate and sustainable drainage facilities are provided and to prevent any increased risk of flooding. The application therefore fails to accord with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies SI12 and SI13 of the London Plan (2021), and Policy CS.1U of The Core Strategy (2012), and Policies DM9, DM10, DM22 and DM23 of the Development Management Policies Plan (2013).\r\n"
