    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development by reason of its excessive bulk and height, and its siting in relation to No.141 Uxbridge Road would represent an overbearing, and visually obtrusive form of development and would therefore adversely impact upon the amenities of the existing occupants of neighbouring property at No. 141 Uxbridge Road. The development would therefore fail to comply with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021),  policy D3 (7) of The London Plan (2021), policy, DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013), the adopted Supplementary Planning Document Residential Design Guide (2010) and would therefore not be within the tolerances of Condition A.A.2(3)(a)(i) of Class AA of Part 1, Schedule 2 of the General Permitted Development Order (2015) as amended.  \r\n\r\n\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposal has failed to demonstrate that the floor to ceiling height of any additional storey, measured internally, would exceed the lower of 3 metres or the floor to ceiling height, measured internally, of any storey of the principal part of the existing dwellinghouse, and would not therefore be within the tolerances of A.A.1(h) of Class AA of Part 1, Schedule 2 of the General Permitted Development Order (2015) as amended.
