    "Reason : 1 - The proposed single storey side extension would extend beyond a wall forming a side elevation of the original dwellinghouse, and would have a width greater than half the width of the original dwellinghouse and is therefore not within the tolerances of Schedule 2, Part 1 Class A.1 j (iii) of The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 as amended.",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed single storey side extension, together with the existing single storey side extension would exceed the limits of A.1 j (iii) and is therefore not within the tolerances of Schedule 2, Part 1 Class A.1 j (ja) of The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 as amended.",
    "Reason : 3 - The additional roof space from the crown roof of the proposed single storey side extension in combination with the existing roof extensions will result in the cubic content of the roof space exceeding the cubic content of the original roof space by more than 50 cubic metres and is therefore not within the tolerances of Schedule 2, Part 1 Class B.1 d (ii) of The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 as amended.",
    "Reason : 4 - The proposal is NOT therefore a lawful development."
