    "Condition : 1 - Non-Material Amendments\r\n1. Addition of two velux rooflights to front roofslope and addition of rooflight above entrance roof\r\n2. Introduction of front gate, external plant and bin and cycle storage\r\n \r\n",
    "Reason : 1 - Within the context of planning application P/0665/21 granted on 03/09/2021, the proposed amendment would be different in its scale of fenestration and addition of bin, cycle storage, external plant and boundary changes, the development would result in a material change to the character and appearance of the host dwelling, street scene and wider area. It would therefore require re-consultation of neighbouring properties and stakeholders, and the proposal would need to be re-assessed against the requirements of Policy D3 of The London Plan (2021) and Policy DM1 of the Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010). The proposal is therefore not considered to be non-material minor amendment."
