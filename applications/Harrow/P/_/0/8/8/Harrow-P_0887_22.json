    "Reason : 1 - The proposed first floor extension to the existing dwellinghouse to form a two storey dwellinghouse, front dormer roof extensions and front extension, by reason of their combined siting, cumulative bulk, massing, unsatisfactory design and creation of large crown roof would result in an unsympathetic, incongruous, bulky, unduly dominant and contrived form of development that fails to respect the character, composition and design of the host dwelling and prevailing pattern of development along the street scene. When considered in conjunction with the proposed extension of the front roof slope, the proposed front dormer roof extensions are considered to result in a harmful visual cluttering of the front elevation of the dwellinghouse, detracting from its overall character and appearance, and having an adverse impact on the overall visual amenity afforded along the street scene. The proposal would thereby be contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D3 (1) and (11) of The  London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 A, DM1 B (a), (b) and (c) of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed additional storey in conjunction with the first floor rear extension, by reason of excessive rearward projection and siting in close proximity to the neighbouring occupiers of No. 14 and No.18 The Glen and transgression of the 45 degree assessment would result in a development which would create a sense of enclosure and give rise to overbearing impacts as well as a loss of outlook and daylight from the rear facing habitable windows and rear amenity spaces, to the detriment of the residential amenities of the occupiers of the adjacent property at No.14 and 18 The Glen contrary to Policy D3 D.7 of The London Plan (2021), Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document Residential Design Guide (2010)."
