    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development, by reason of incongruous and contrived roof design, poor roof form; bulky and discordant rear dormer which is not visually contained, would fail to respect the character and appearance of the host building and would be out of keeping with the pattern of development in the street scene and would substantially harm the form, openness and proportion of the site and the wider relationship with the properties in the locality, this is accentuated by its prominent siting and poor architectural detailing which is to the detriment of the character and appearance of the streetscene and the pattern of development within the surrounding area and would therefore be contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies D3.D(1) and D3.D(11) of The London Plan (2021), Policy CS.1B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 of the Development Management Plan Local Policies (2013) and the Adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010)."
