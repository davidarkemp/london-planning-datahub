    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development, by reason of its excessive size, bulk and limited set back from the boundaries of the host building, would be visually obtrusive and incongruous within its context, to the detriment of the visual amenities of the neighbouring residents and the character of the area, contrary to Policy D3 (7) of the London Plan (2021), Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies (2013) and would not be within the tolerances Condition A.2(1)(e) Class A, Part 20 of Schedule 2 of the General Permitted Development Order (2015) as amended.",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed extensions would adversely impact upon the amenity of the neighbouring occupiers at Nos 1 and 2 Hillingdon Court, in terms of overbearing and overlooking impacts. The development would therefore would fail to comply with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D3 (D7) of The London Plan (2021), Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document Residential Design Guide (2010) and would not be within the tolerances Condition A.2(1)(g) Class A, Part 20 of Schedule 2 of the General Permitted Development Order (2015) as amended.",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposal does not make adequate provision for parking within the curtilage of the property and given the present highway and traffic conditions in this road, is likely to have an adverse effect on highway safety and movement, contrary to  Policies T3, T4, T6 of the London Plan (2021) and DM42 of Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013)."
