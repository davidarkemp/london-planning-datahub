    "Reason : 2 - The proposal, by reason of its prominent siting, excessive width, and bulk, inappropriate proximity to site boundaries and lack of adequate setting space would result in a cramped, dominant form of development which would fail to respect the character and appearance of the site, the nearby buildings and the prevailing pattern of development in the area, to the detriment of the character and appearance of the streetscene and the local area, contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies D3.D (1)  and D3.D (11) of the London Plan (2021); Core Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).\r\n\r\n"
