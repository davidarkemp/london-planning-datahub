    "Reason : 1 - The proposed new building, by reason of its excessive height, scale, bulk, massing, poorly articulated design and blocky form, would result in an incongruous, unsympathetic and contrived form of development which would appear unduly at odds with other buildings located along this side of the service road. The proposal would thereby be contrary to the high quality aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies D3 D(1) and D3 D(11) of the London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policies DM1 A, DM1 B (a), (b) and (c) of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed building, by reason of its excessive height, scale, bulk, massing and proximate siting in relation to the rear gardens of properties directly to the south along Devonshire Road (No. 12 and No.4 and 5 Stratton Court) would appear as unduly overbearing and unneighbourly when viewed from the rear gardens of these neighbouring properties. Furthermore, by reason of the proposed building's proximate siting to the rear facing habitable room window serving No. 467A Uxbridge Road to the north, the proposed development would unduly restrict outlook and visual amenity afforded to this neighbouring property. The proposed development would thereby be contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D3 D(7) of The London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012) and Policies DM1 C and DM1 D (d), (e), and (f) of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013).",
    "Reason : 3 - By reason of the fact that the site is located within an area of land liable to flooding, and insufficient details have been provided in regard to drainage strategy, impacts of fluvial flooding, compensatory flood storage, ground level details, permeable paving and emergency evacuation, the applicant has failed to demonstrate that the proposed development would not exacerbate the risk of flooding within the site or increase the risk and consequences of flooding elsewhere. The proposal would thereby be contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy SI 12 C and SI 13 of the London Plan (2021), Policy CS1.U and CS1.W of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM9 A, DM9 B and DM10 A of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013)."
