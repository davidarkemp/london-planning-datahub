    "Reason : 1 - The proposed front dormer and the combined end gable and second floor extension by reason of their poor quality design and uncharacteristic form, would result in an unsympathetic, incongruous and visually intrusive form of development that fails to respect the form, character, appearance and design of both the host building and the attached semi-detached dwelling and the wider locality. The proposal would therefore be to the detriment to the character and appearance of the subject building, the wider pattern of development and visual amenities of the area, contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policy D3.D(1) and D3.D(11) of The London Plan (2021), policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012) and policy DM1 of the Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed single rear extension by reason of its rearward projection would give rise to an overbearing, unneighbourly and visually obtrusive form of development which would result in an unacceptable impact on the amenities of No. 11 Northumberland Road.  Furthermore, the proposed combined end gable and second floor extension, when viewed from adjoining rear gardens at Nos. 11 and 15 Northumberland Road, would form a visually intrusive and unneighbourly form of development. The proposed development would thereby be contrary to the Policy D3 D.(7) of The London Plan (2021), Policy DM1 of the Development Management Policies Local Plan document (2013) and the relevant provisions of the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010)."
