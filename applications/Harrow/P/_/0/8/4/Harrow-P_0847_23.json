    "Reason : 1 - The proposed single storey front extension (garage), by reason of its excessive forward projection and siting in relation to No. 21 Georgian Close, would introduce an overly bulky and obtrusive form of development that would fail to respect the proportions of the existing dwellinghouse, and the character and appearance of the neighbouring properties and would give rise to overshadowing, loss of outlook and an overbearing impact to No. 21, to the detriment of the character and appearance of the existing dwellinghouse, the adjacent dwellinghouses, and the residential and visual amenities of the occupiers of No. 21 St Georgian Close, contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D3 D.1, D.7 and D.11 of The London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 2 - The Local Planning Authority has been unable to make an accurate and comprehensive assessment of the proposed raising of the roof height, with regards to its impact on the visual amenity and the character of the adjoining properties and the surrounding area, by reason of insufficient information within the submitted plans and elevations in relation to illustrating the proposed development in context of adjoining dwellings' heights and streetview. The proposal is therefore contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policy D3 D.1 and D.11 of The London Plan (2021), core policy CS 1 B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), policy DM 1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010)."
