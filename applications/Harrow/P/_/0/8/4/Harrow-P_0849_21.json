  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development, by reason of its prominent corner location, poor massing across the site and poor design rationale results in a development that lacks visual and physical cohesion, an inappropriate roof design and alterations to the existing building and a separate new building which is of a low design quality and lacks appropriate architectural detailing on the front and side elevations. It would therefore give rise to a discordant, incongruous and out of keeping development, which lacks cohesiveness and architectural design quality and would be highly visible in the streetscene  to the detriment of the character and appearance of the existing property, the wider streetscene, and the visual amenities of the area, contrary to the high quality design aspirations set out in the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), policies D3(D1 and D11) of The London Plan (2021),  policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), policy DM1 of the Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed development, by reason of poor quality design, introducing an unacceptably long access corridor and deeply recessed door to the residential units within the existing dwelling, and the provision of the undercroft area within the separate new building, would fail to provide a safe and secure development in line with Secure by Design principles contrary to policy D11 of the London Plan (2021), policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012) and policies DM1 and DM2 of the Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013).",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed second floor units Flats C and D, by reason of inadequate information to demonstrate that they would have sufficient internal height and circulation space, would likely result in poor quality, cramped and substandard accommodation, to the detriment of the future occupiers of those units. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy D6 of London Plan (2021), policy CS1.K of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013), the Mayor of London's Housing Supplementary Planning Guidance (March 2016), and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 4 - The proposed extension of the loft floor to the rear of the building, by reason of its depth and siting, would project significantly beyond the adjacent rear dormer window of no. 24 Village Way East; while the proposed two-storey building at the rear of the site, by reason of the extensive two-storey predominantly fa�ades in close proximity to part of Veneto House and the siting of the building within close proximity to the proposed Flat B, would result in poor outlook and undue visual amenity impacts for residents and future occupiers of these properties. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy D3(D7) and D6 of the London Plan (2021), policyCS1.K of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010)."
