The applicant has failed to provide sufficient information to indicate that the development would be constructed in an appropriate way to minimise the risk of fire spread, they have failed to provide sufficient details on means of escape and an associated evacuation strategy for all building users. In the absence of satisfactory information, the council cannot be satisfied that the development would be appropriately safe in the event of a fire, contrary to Policy D12(a) of The London Plan (2021)."
