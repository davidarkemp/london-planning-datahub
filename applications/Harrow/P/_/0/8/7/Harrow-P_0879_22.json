    "Reason : 1 - 1)\tThe proposed first floor side and rear extensions together with the existing hip to gable and rear dormer roof extensions, by reason of their excessive combined width, bulk, massing, failure to incorporate sympathetic roof forms, and the first floor rear extension's awkward intersection of the dwellinghouse's gable ended roof form and rear dormer would form incongruous, discordant, contrived, unduly bulky and dominant additions to the host dwelling, and with the first floor rear extension resulting in undesirable visual cluttering of the rear elevation of the building. The proposed first floor side and rear extensions would appear unduly at odds with the established pattern of development along the road, to the detriment of the overall visual amenities of the street scene. The proposal would thereby be contrary to the high-quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D3.D (1) and D3.D (11) of The London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 A., DM1 B. (a), (b) and (c) of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010)."
