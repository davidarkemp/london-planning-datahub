    "Reason : 1 - The proposed front extension, by reason of its incompatible roof design with the roof of the main dwellinghouse, would give rise to a visually obtrusive and incongruous form of development that would be harmful to the character and appearance of the subject dwelling and the local area, contrary to the high quality design aspirations set out in the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policy D3.D (11) of The London Plan (2021), policy CS1.B on the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), policy DM1 of the Development Management Local Plans Policies (2013) and adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed rear dormer by the reason of its prominent siting and size, and the material proposed, would not achieve visual containment and would not match the materials of the existing roof. Therefore, it is considered to result in an incongruous and inappropriate form of development interrupting the character of the main house. The development therefore fails to meet the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), and is contrary to Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021), Core Strategy Policy CS1.B (2012), policies DM1 and DM26 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Harrow Supplementary Planning Document Residential Design Guide (2010).\r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - The flat roof of the proposed first floor rear extension, by reason of its incompatible roof design with the main roof of the dwellinghouse, would give rise to a visually obtrusive and incongruous form of development that would be harmful to the character and appearance of the subject dwelling and the local area, contrary to the high quality design aspirations set out in the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policy D3.D (11) of The London Plan (2021), policy CS1.B on the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), policy DM1 of the Development Management Local Plans Policies (2013) and adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010). ",
    "Reason : 4 - The proposed first floor side to rear extension, by reason of the absence of a set back by at least 1m from the principal elevation and a subordinate pitched roof would result in a visually obtrusive and incongruous form of development that would fail to reflect the appearance of the streetscene and be harmful to the character and appearance of the subject dwelling and the local area, contrary to the high quality design aspirations set out in the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policy D3.D (11) of The London Plan (2021), policy CS1.B on the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), policy DM1 of the Development Management Local Plans Policies (2013) and adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 5 - The proposed development, by reason of the increase in height of the roof ridge of the main dwellinghouse, would result in a contrived and discordant form of development that fails to respect the character and appearance of the subject dwelling and the local area, contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021),  Policy D3.D (11) of the London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 of the Harrow.",
    "Reason : 6 - The size and appearance of the fenestration within the principal elevation at first floor level, would have an unduly detrimental impact on the character and appearance of the main dwellinghouse and would be out of keeping with the surrounding area, contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021),  Policy D3.D(1) and (11) of the London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 of the Harrow."
