The developer has therefore provided insufficient information to enable the authority to establish whether the proposed development fully complies with limitations A.1(g)(ii), A.1(i), A.4(2)(a.ii) and A.4(2)(a.iii) of development permitted by Class A.1(g) to Part 1 (of Schedule 2) of The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015, as amended."
