    "Reason : 1 - The proposal fails to accurately reflect the proposed development due to discrepancies between the proposed side and rear elevations, which gives a misleading and inaccurate impression of the height of development, contrary to Article 7.1 of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "Reason : 2 - Notwithstanding reason for refusal No.1, the proposed dwelling, by reason of single aspect and poor-quality outlook, served predominantly by high level windows with outlook to the side boundary, lack of any private open space and lack of defensible space to the front door and windows, would create a poor standard of living accommodation for future occupiers to the detriment of their residential amenity. Additionally, by reason of its siting and excessive height, the proposal would have an unacceptable amenity impact in terms of outlook and sense of enclosure on the neighbouring residential dwellings at Nos.475, 477 and 479 Uxbridge Road. As such, the proposal is contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies D3.D(7) and D6 of The London Plan (2021), Policy CS1 of the Harrow Core Strategy (2013), policies DM1 and DM27 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013), the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide Supplementary Planning Document (2010).",
    "Reason : 3 - Notwithstanding reason for refusal No.1, the proposal fails to adequately demonstrate the provision and location of adequate waste storage for the existing dwellings on the subject site, and the existing retail/commercial space. It has therefore not been adequately demonstrated that the development will provide satisfactory storage volume to meet the general, recycling and organic waste material arising from the site, contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D6.E of The London Plan (2021), Policy CS.1X of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policies DM1, and DM45 of the Development Management Plan Local Policies (2013) and the Adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).
