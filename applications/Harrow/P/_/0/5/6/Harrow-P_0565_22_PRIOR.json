    "Reason : 1 - The proposed single storey rear extension, by reason of its excessive rearward projection and its siting immediately adjacent to the boundary shared with the adjoining property No.370 Eastcote Lane, would result in an unacceptable loss outlook and sense of enclosure. The proposal would therefore be detrimental to the visual and residential amenities of the occupiers of No.370 Eastcote Lane contrary to the high-quality design aspiration of The National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D3 (7) of The London Plan (2021), policy DM 1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010)."
