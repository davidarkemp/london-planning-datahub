    "Reason : 1 - The proposed roof extension would incorporate an associated parapet wall which would partly exceed the height of the highest part of the existing roof. The proposal would therefore not be within the tolerances of Schedule 2, Part 1, Class B, B.1 (b) of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed roof extension would include an associated parapet wall which would extend partly beyond the plane of an existing roof slope, which would form the principal elevation of the house and would front a highway. The proposal would therefore not be within the tolerances of Schedule 2, Part 1, Class B, B.1 (c) of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).\r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - The total volume of the proposed roof extensions would exceed 50m3 and would  therefore not be within the tolerances of Schedule 2, Part 1, Class B, B.1 (d)(ii) of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).\r\n",
