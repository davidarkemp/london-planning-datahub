    "Reason : 1 - The Local Planning Authority has been unable to make an accurate and comprehensive assessment of the proposal, regarding its impact on the visual amenity and the character of the adjoining properties and the surrounding area, by reason of insufficient information within the submitted plans and elevations in relation to illustrating adjoining dwellings' heights and distances to the proposed development. The proposal is therefore contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policy D3 D.1 and D.11 and D.12 of the London Plan (2021), core policy CS 1 B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), policy DM 1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010)."
