    "Reason : 1 - The proposed hip to gable and rear dormer extensions in conjunction with \r\nthe existing two storey side extension, by reason of inappropriate design, excessive bulk and massing would result in incongruous, discordant and ungainly cumulative additions to the dwelling and the rear dormer by reason of its excessive size and lack of visual containment would give rise to a bulky and dominant addition within the rear roofslope. On this basis, the proposed development would cause detrimental harm to the character and appearance of the host dwelling and the local area, contrary to Policy D3.D (1) of the London Plan (2021), policy CS1.B of the Core Strategy (2012), policy DM1 of the Development Management Policies (2013), and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).
