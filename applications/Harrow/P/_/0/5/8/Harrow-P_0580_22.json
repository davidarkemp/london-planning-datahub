  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed part single storey rear extension by reason of its excessive rearward projection and lack of set back from the neighbouring boundary with No. 71 Pinner Hill Road would result in a development which would appear visually obtrusive, and would give rise to a loss of daylight and outlook and overbearing impacts to the rear 'protected' windows and amenity space of No. 71 Pinner Hill Road whIch would be harmful to the residential amenities of the occupiers of this neighbouring dwelling. The proposed development would thereby be contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D3(7)  of the London Plan (2021), Policy DM1 B. (a), DM1 C., and DM1 D. (d), (e) and (f) of the Development Management Policies Local Plan document (2013) and the relevant provisions of the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - Insufficient information has been provided in the Flood Risk Assessment in relation to Flood Extent Maps / Data and Compensatory Flood Storage. The proposal has therefore failed to demonstrate compliance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), policy CS1.U of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012) and policies DM9 and DM10 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013)."
