    "Reason : 1 - The proposed single storey rear extension by reason of its excessive rearward projection and its siting immediately adjacent to the south-eastern shared boundary would create an overbearing and visually prominent structure, that when viewed from the rear elevation and garden of no.22 Vancouver Road would result in a large physical presence and a loss of outlook to the adjacent protected window, to the detriment of the visual and residential amenities of the occupiers of the adjoining property contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), Policy D3.D(7) of The London Plan (2021), Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010)."
