    "Reason : 1 - The proposed first floor side extension, by reason of the absence of a set back by at least 1m from the principal elevation, the proposed eaves would not reflect the original building, and its prominent siting, volume and size combined with the existing extensions, would result in a bulky, visually obtrusive and incongruous form of development that would fail to reflect the appearance of the streetscene and be harmful to the character and appearance of the subject dwelling and the local area, contrary to the high quality design aspirations set out in the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policy D3.D (11) of The London Plan (2021), policy CS1.B on the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), policy DM1 of the Development Management Local Plans Policies (2013) and adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010)."
