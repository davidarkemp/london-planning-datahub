    "Reason : 1 - The proposal would result in the additional dwellinghouse being sited on garden land. As such, the principle of the development is contrary to the Harrow Core Strategy of directing new residential and other development to the Harrow and Wealdstone Opportunity Area, town centres and, in suburban areas, to strategic previously developed sites and would therefore harm its implementation, contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies CS1.A and CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Garden Land Development (2013).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed new dwelling, by reason of its size, scale, proportions and siting appears contrived, cramped and out of keeping with the existing dwellinghouse (No.13) and the wider pattern of development to the detriment of the character and appearance of the streetscene, and the pattern of development within the surrounding area. The proposal would therefore be contrary to the high-quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies D3.D(1) and D3.D(11) of The London Plan (2021), Policy CS.1B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 of the Development Management Plan Local Policies (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed new dwelling, by reason of its positioning, location of windows and siting of the private amenity space would have an unacceptable impact on the amenities of future occupiers by way of poor quality private amenity space and neighbouring occupiers at Nos 13 and 15 Rosslyn Crescent, by way of adverse overlooking, sense of enclosure and outlook contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies D3.D(7) and D6 of the London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1 (B) of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), policy DM 1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010)."
