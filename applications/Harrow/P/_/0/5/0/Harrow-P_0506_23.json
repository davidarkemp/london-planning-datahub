    "Reason : 1 - The proposed removal of condition 7, by reason of the potential for cross contamination and miss-connection between foul and surface water networks, together with a failure to adequately demonstrate appropriate waste-water handling for the car wash would have potential for adverse impacts on water quality and watercourses. The application fails to prevent new and existing development from contributing to unacceptable levels of water pollution and fails to improve the water environment. The proposal would therefore be contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy SI 5 of the London Plan (2021) and Policy DM10 of the Harrow Development Management Policies (2013) "
