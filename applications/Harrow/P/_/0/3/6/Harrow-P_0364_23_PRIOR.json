    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development fails to comply with condition G.1 (b) of Class G of Part 3, Schedule 2 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended) as the proposed ground floor flat would be in part of the ground floor where the building has a display window at ground floor level. \r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - Insufficient details have been submitted in relation to Flood Risk Assessment, the applicant has failed to demonstrate that the future occupiers of the proposed development would not be exposed to unacceptable levels of flood risk within the site and adjacent to the site, contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy SI12 of the London Plan (2021), Policy CS1 of the Core Strategy (2012)\r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - In the absence of proposed section drawings, detailing the internal head height of the proposed unit, the Council cannot be satisfied that the unit would be provided with a sufficient internal head height in line with the minimum internal head height requirements set out within the Department for Communities and Local Government Technical Housing Standards - Nationally Described Space Standards (2015). The proposal would therefore be contrary to paragraph 3(9A)(b) of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) (Amendment) Order 2015 (as amended) and would give rise to substandard and poor quality accommodation to the detriment of the residential amenities of the future occupiers of the unit contrary to the high quality design aspirations of The National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policies D3 D (7) and D6 F (8)  of The London Plan (2021), policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012) and policies DM1 C and DM1 D (g) of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013).\r\n"
