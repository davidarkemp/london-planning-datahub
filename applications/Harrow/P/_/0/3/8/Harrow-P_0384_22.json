    "Reason : 1 - The proposed two storey rear extension together with the proposed single storey rear extensions, due to their excessive size and scale would not relate well or harmonise with the design and appearance of the host dwelling. The proposal would result in an unsympathetic form of development which is bulky and unduly obtrusive to the detriment of the character and appearance of the host dwelling, the Locally Listed Building and the Harrow on the Hill Conservation Area contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policies D3 (D(1) and D(11)) and HC1 of The London Plan (2021), policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), policies DM1 and DM7 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013), the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010) and the Harrow on The Hill Conservation Area Management Strategy (2008). \r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed two storey rear extension, by reason of its excessive depth and siting in relation to the first floor window of the adjacent building (Parkside) would be overbearing, resulting in a unneighbourly form of development that would be detrimental to the visual and residential amenities of the occupiers of Flats 1-3 Parkside, London Road. The proposed development is contrary to Policy D3 (D(7)), policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).
