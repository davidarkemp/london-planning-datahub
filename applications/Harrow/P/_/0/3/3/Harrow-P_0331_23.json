    "Condition : 1 - The development hereby permitted shall be begun before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.\nREASON:  To comply with the provisions of Section 91 of the Town & Country Planning Act 1990.",
    "Condition : 2 - The development hereby permitted shall be carried out, completed and retained in accordance with the following approved plans and documents: 3WG/100(Location Plan); 3WG/101(Site Plan); 3WG/102(Existing Elevations); 3WG/103 (Existing Elevations); 3WG/104(Proposed Ground and First Floor Plans); 3WG/105(Proposed Loft and Roof Plans); 3WG/106revA(Proposed Elevations).\r\nREASON: For the avoidance of doubt and in the interests of proper planning.\r\n\r\n",
    "Condition : 3 - The materials to be used in the construction of the external surfaces of the extension hereby permitted shall match those used in the existing building.\nREASON: To safeguard the character and appearance of the area in accordance with Core Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012) and Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013).\n",
    "Condition : 4 - Notwithstanding the provisions of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (or any order revoking and re-enacting that order with or without modification), no window(s)/door(s) shall be installed in the flank elevation(s) of the development hereby permitted without the prior permission in writing of the local planning authority.\nREASON: To safeguard the amenity of neighbouring residents in accordance with Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013).\n",
    "Condition : 5 - The roof area of the extension hereby permitted shall not be used as a balcony, roof garden or similar amenity area without the grant of further specific permission from the local planning authority.\nREASON: To safeguard the residential  amenities of neighbouring residents, in accordance with Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013).\n",
    "Reason : 1 - The single storey rear extension by reason of its siting and significant rearward projection would appear highly intrusive, overbearing, would significantly increase the loss of outlook and enclosure to the detriment of the residential and visual amenities of the occupiers of the neighbouring properties at No. 1 and 5 Wildcroft Gardens. As such, the proposed development would be contrary to Policy D3.D (7) and (11) of the London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and guidance contained in the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed rear dormer extension by reason of its significant width would dominate the rear roof slope. The dormer extension would fail to integrate with vernacular of the existing property, would create an obtrusive and incongruous form of development which would be at odds, would appear strident and would not be subordinate or respect the scale and proportions of the external appearance of the roof and elevation in which the dormer window would be constructed. The development therefore fails to meet the high-quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), and is contrary to Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021), Core Strategy Policy CS1.B (2012), Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Harrow Supplementary Planning Document Residential Design Guide (2010)."
