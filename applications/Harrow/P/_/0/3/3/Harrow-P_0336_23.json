The proposed development would thereby be contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D3 D (7) of The London Plan (2021), Policy DM1 of the Development Management Policies Local Plan document (2013) and the relevant provisions of the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010)."
