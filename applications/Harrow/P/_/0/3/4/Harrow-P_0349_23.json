    "Reason : 1 - The proposed two storey side extension, by reason of its prominent siting, overall poor design in conjunction with the bulky gable roof, width, scale, massing and its failure to provide a setback from the front wall of the host building and southern side boundary would fail to provide a proportionate, balanced, subordinate and harmonious addition to the host building which serve to introduce an overly dominant, obtrusive and incongruous form of development and would fail to respect the scale, character and appearance of the surrounding properties, the development is therefore detrimental to the character and appearance of the existing building and the adjacent dwellings, and the established and prevailing pattern of development in the locality contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D3 (D(1) and (11)) of The  London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 A, DM1 B (a), (b) and (c) of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed single storey rear extension by reason of its overall poor design, scale, bulk and awkward shape would fail to form a subordinate and harmonious addition to the host building which serve to introduce an overly dominant, obtrusive and incongruous form of development that subsumes the rear elevation of the host building and fails to respect the scale, character and appearance of the surrounding properties, the development is therefore detrimental to the character and appearance of the existing building and the adjacent dwellings, and the established and prevailing pattern of development in the locality contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D3 (D(1) and (11)) of The  London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 A, DM1 B (a), (b) and (c) of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).\r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed rear dormer extension by reason of its overall poor design, scale, bulk and siting within the rear roof profile, and excessive width would fail to provide proportionate, balanced, subordinate and harmonious addition to the host building which serve to introduce an overly dominant, obtrusive and incongruous form of development that subsumes the rear elevation of the host building and fails to respect the scale, character and appearance of the surrounding properties, the development is therefore detrimental to the character and appearance of the existing building and the adjacent dwellings, and the established and prevailing pattern of development in the locality contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D3 (D(1) and (11)) of The  London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 A, DM1 B (a), (b) and (c) of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).\r\n",
    "Reason : 4 - The proposed single storey rear extension by reason of its height, angled walls with large openings would result in a harmful impact on the neighbouring property at no. 134 Marsh Lane in terms of overlooking, loss of privacy and outlook. As such, the proposal would be contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D3 (D7) of The London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and guidance contained in the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010)."
