    "Reason : 1 - The proposed dwelling, by reason of incongruous and contrived design, resulting from the disproportionate width of the ground floor side extension sited parallel to the angled side boundary, introduction of additional front door to the front elevation, incompatible roof form of first floor rear extension and inappropriate subdivision of the rear garden would fail to provide a coherent pattern of development in the street scene would harm the form, openness and proportion of the site, relationship with the properties in the locality accentuated by its prominent siting and poor architectural detailing to the detriment of the character and appearance of the streetscene and the pattern of development within the surrounding area and would therefore be contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), Policies D3.D(1) and D3.D(11) of The London Plan (2021), Policy CS.1B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 of the Development Management Plan Local Policies (2013) and the Adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposal, by reason of undersized room width of bedroom 2 within Unit 1, inappropriate internal layout, insufficient floor to ceiling heights would give rise to a substandard and poor quality accommodation to the detriment of the residential amenities of the future occupiers of the new dwelling, contrary to National Planning Policy Framework (2021), D3(D(7)) and D6 of The London Plan (2021), policies DM1 and DM26 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013), the Mayor of London Housing Supplementary Planning Guidance (2016) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Documents Residential Design Guide (2010).\r\n"
