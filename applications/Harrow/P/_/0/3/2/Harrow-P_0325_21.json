    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development by reason of its excessive width, scale, siting, lack of setting space and overall cumulative bulk, would fail to respect the character, massing, form and composition of the host dwellinghouse and the neighbouring properties and would give rise to an overdevelopment of the property and would introduce a bulky, incongruous and obtrusive form of development in the street scene that would subsume the original character and scale of the dwellinghouse, to the detriment of the character and appearance of the existing dwellinghouse on site and the locality,  contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2019),  Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021), policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), policies DM 1 and DM 26 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010). ",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed two storey side to rear extension adjacent to No. 106 St Andrew's Drive, by reason of its excessive depth, rearward projection and siting would lead to an overbearing impact and would result in overshadowing, loss of light and outlook to the occupiers of this neighbouring property, to the detriment of their residential and visual amenities, contrary to policy D3 of the London Plan (2021), policy DM 1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed subdivision of the rear amenity space would give rise to an over intensive use of the site and would fail to respect the pattern of existing development in the area, to the detriment of the character and appearance of the locality,  contrary  to the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021), Policies DM1, DM26 and DM 27 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document Residential Design Guide (2010)."
