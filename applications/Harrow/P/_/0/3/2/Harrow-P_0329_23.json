    "Reason : 1 - The details submitted in relation to condition 3 (Demolition and Construction Plan) fails to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority that the proposed development would minimise the impacts of construction upon the amenities of neighbouring occupiers  and to ensure that development does not adversely affect safety on the transport network in accordance with Policy T3 of the London Plan (2021) and policies DM1 and DM43 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013).\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The details submitted in relation to conditions 5 (Water Surface) 6 (Sewage Disposal) and 7 (Permeable Paving) by reason of their failure to consider the protection of the existing piped watercourse located within the site would result in the proposed development having a harmful impact on the piped watercourse within the site and fail to ensure that adequate drainage facilities are provided to reduce and mitigate the effect of flood risk. As such, the proposal is contrary to policies DM9 and DM10 of the Development Management Policies Local Plan 2013.",
    "Reason : 3 - The information submitted in relation to condition 9 (hard and soft landscaping) fails to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority that the development would make a sufficient provision for hard landscaping and fails to provide details of boundary treatment which contributes to the creation of a high quality, accessible, safe and attractive public realm and to ensure a high standard of design, layout and amenity. As such, the proposal is contrary to policies DM1 and DM22 of the Development Management Policies Local Plan 2013."
