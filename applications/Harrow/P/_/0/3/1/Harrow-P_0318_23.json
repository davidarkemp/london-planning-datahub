    "Reason : 1 - The proposed rear extension, by reason of its siting and depth, would give rise to an overbearing, unneighbourly and visually obtrusive form of development which would result in an unacceptable impact on the amenities of No.401 Torbay Road. The proposed development would thereby be contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D3 D (7) of The London Plan (2021), Policy DM1 of the Development Management Policies Local Plan document (2013) and the relevant provisions of the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 2 - Insufficient information has been submitted in relation to consent for works within 5 metres of an existing waterway and in relation to the Compensatory Flood Storage to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority that the proposed development would ensure that suitable drainage responses to the site and existing infrastructure in accordance with policy SI 12 (C) of The London Plan (2021) and policies DM9 and DM11 of the Development Management Policies Local Plan 2013."
