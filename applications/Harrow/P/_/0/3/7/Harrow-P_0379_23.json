  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed flats 1 and 2 by reason of their internal layouts in relation to the ground floor front bedroom obscured by a front extension along with an undersized one person bedroom for the first floor level flat, would provide substandard living accommodation and would fail to provide an adequate means of light and outlook to the detriment of the residential amenities of the potential future occupiers of these flats. The proposal is therefore contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies D3 (D(7))and D6 of The London Plan (2021), Policies DM1 and DM26 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed development fails to demonstrate that 75% of the internal floor to ceiling height of each unit would exceed 2.3m and as such the proposal would create a cramped and poor standard of living accommodation for future occupiers, contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D6 of The London Plan (2021), policies DM1 and DM26 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013), the Technical Housing Standards Nationally Described Space Standards (2015), the Mayor of London Supplementary Planning Guidance (2016), and the adopted Residential Design Guide Supplementary Planning Document (2010).",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed development by failure to provide adequate private amenity spaces for flat 2 would result in a substandard quality of living accommodation to the detriment of the residential amenities of future occupiers of the residential unit contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021),  policies D3(D(7)) and D6 of The London Plan (2021), policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), policies DM1, DM26 and DM27 of the Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013), the Mayor of London Housing Supplementary Planning Guidance (2016) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 4 - The proposed bin storage within the forecourt, together with the proposed cycle stands and lack of any soft landscaping would result in visual clutter and poor standard of development to the detriment of the character and appearance of the host building and streetscene and residential amenities of the future occupiers of the flats. As such, the development would be contrary to DM1, DM23, DM26 and DM45 of the Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 5 - The proposed additional front porch extension, due to its design and the proliferation of front doors within the front elevation of the enlarged property, would give rise to an incongruous and inappropriate form of development interrupting the character of the main house and neighbouring properties to the detriment of the character and appearance of the dwellinghouses and the established pattern of development in the area. The development therefore fails to meet the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), and is contrary to Policy D3(D(1) and (D(11)) of The London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1.B of Harrow Core Strategy  (2012), Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Harrow Supplementary Planning Document Residential Design Guide (2010)."
