    "Reason : 1 - The proposal by reason of failure to provide an Arboricultural Impact Assessment and detailed site levels information, the local planning authority has been unable to accurately assess the impacts of the proposal on the surrounding locality, contrary the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policy D3 D (1) and (11) of the London Plan (2021), core policy CS 1 B of the Harrow Core Strategy, policies DM 1, DM 22 and DM 23 of the Harrow Development Management policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted supplementary Planning Document Residential Design Guide (2013).",
    "Reason : 2 - Notwithstanding reason 1, the proposal, by reason of its poor and prominent siting, proposed materials and the resultant loss of trees and streetside greenery would result in an incongruous, unduly obtrusive and highly conspicuous development which would be at odds with the prevailing pattern of development in the street and would be harmful to the character and appearance of Ellen Web Drive, to the detriment of the locality, contrary to the high quality design aspiration of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policy D3 D (1) and (11) of the London Plan (2021), core policy CS 1 B of the Harrow Core Strategy, policies DM 1, DM 22 and DM 23 of the Harrow Development Management policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted supplementary Planning Document Residential Design Guide (2013).",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposal, by reason of its siting on an area of land proposed for residential amenity space for the future occupiers of the upper floor flats of 7B High Street, would prejudice the quality and standard of living accommodation granted under planning permission P/3001/20, to the detriment of the residential amenities of the future occupiers of the upper floor flats of 7B, contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policy D6 of the London Plan, policies DM 1 and DM 27 of the Harrow of the Harrow Development Management policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted supplementary Planning Document Residential Design Guide (2013).",
    "Reason : 4 - The proposed dwellinghouse, by reason of insufficient Gross Internal Floor Area (GIA), would give rise to a cramped layout and a poor standard of living conditions for the future occupiers of the flat, to the detriment of their residential amenities, contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policy D6 of the London Plan, policy DM 1 of the Harrow of the Harrow Development Management policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted supplementary Planning Document Residential Design Guide (2013)."
