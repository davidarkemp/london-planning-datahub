    "Reason : 1 - The proposed rear roof additions by reason of poor design, excessive bulk and inadequate visual containment within the existing roof form and when viewed together with the existing two storey rear projection and neighbouring properties, would result in  a contrived and incongruous addition that would unacceptably harm the character and appearance of the original building and the visual amenities of the area, contrary to the high design quality requirements set out in the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policies D3 (D)(1) and D(11)) of The London Plan (2021), Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 of the Development Management Local Plans Policies (2013) and  Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposal, by reason of poor quality outlook, with the new unit being served predominantly by rooflights and poorly located windows, would create a substandard standard of living accommodation for future occupiers, to the detriment of their residential amenity.  Additionally, the proposal fails to adequately demonstrate the provision of suitable internal floor to ceiling height within the proposed flat. The development is therefore contrary to the Policies D3.D(7), D6 and GG3.F of The London Plan (2021), Policy CS1 K of the Harrow Core Strategy (2013), Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013), the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide Supplementary Planning Document (2010) and the Technical Housing Standards - Nationally Described Space Standards (2016)."
