  "description": "Notice under s.211 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 of intent to Fell and eco plug the stump of x1 Apple tree (T5) at 6 Chestnut Avenue Edgware HA8 7RA We write in reference to our site survey of 24/01/2023 and confirm that we are the arboriculturists appointed on behalf of property insurers of the above risk address. It is the view of chartered engineers appointed to investigate damage that the property has suffered differential movement and subsequent damage consistent with tree related clay shrinkage subsidence. Further to discussions with the Structural Engineer who is assessing the required remedial works for the property, we are of the opinion that it is preferable to remove the implicated trees. This is because retaining the trees and implementing an engineered solution cannot happen without having serious effect on their root systems which are influencing the structure of the risk address. This submission consists of a formal notification under Conservation Area Regulations of our intention to remove the trees as mentioned above which we believe are not protected under any Tree Preservation Order. Whilst insurers have no requirement to submit prescribed levels of supporting evidence in relation to a Conservation Area notification, we are enclosing copies of relevant technical reports, in the attached Appendices, as itemised below: 1. A site plan, survey tables and photographs which locates vegetation that is the subject of this notification. We have demonstrated, from the evidence detailed above, tests in line with current case law that show: 1. Damage to the insured???s property has resulted from tree related subsidence: ??? History and timing of damage indicates it is tree root induced movement ??? Pattern of damage relative to the trees and mechanism of movement implicates the itemised tree species",
