    "Reason : 1 - The appearance of the proposed development by virtue of the addition of an additional floor which fails to sympathetically relate to the appearance and proportions of the host building would result in a contrived and incongruous form of development which would fail to appropriately relate to the appearance of the host building and would fail to respect the character of the surrounding neighbouring properties and pattern of development in the surrounding area. The development would, therefore, not represent an appropriate high quality of design, as required by National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D3 (D(1) and D(11))  of The London Plan (2021), Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies (2013) and would not be within the tolerances Condition A.2(1)(e) of Class A, Part 20 of Schedule 2 of the General Permitted Development Order (2015) as amended.
