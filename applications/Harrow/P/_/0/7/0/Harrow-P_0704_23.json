    "Reason : 1 - The proposed single and two storey rear extension by reason of its scale, overall width at first floor level and siting would result in an insubordinate and bulky addition to the host dwellinghouse, to the detriment of the character and appearance of the host dwelling and the wider area, contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D3 (D(1) and (11)) of The  London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 A, DM1 B (a), (b) and (c) of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed single and two storey rear extension, by reason of its depth and siting would give rise to an overbearing, unneighbourly and visually obtrusive form of development which would result in an unacceptable impact on the amenities of No.164 and No.160 Harrow View, to the detriment of the residential amenities of these neighbouring occupiers. The proposed development would thereby be contrary to Policy D3 D (7) of the London Plan (2021), Policy DM1 of the Development Management Policies Local Plan document (2013) and the relevant provisions of the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010)."
