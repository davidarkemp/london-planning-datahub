    "Reason : 1 - The proposed conversion would result in the loss of a family sized dwelling and would fail to provide an appropriate housing mix to compensate for this, providing an overconcentration of 1-bedroom and studio flats within an out of centre suburban location and failing to provide any family sized accommodation which is a priority need for the Council. The proposed development would thereby fail to adequately contribute to the creation of inclusive and mixed communities. The proposed development would therefore be contrary to the Nationally Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy H10 A of the London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012) and Policy DM24 B of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed conversion by reason of the excessive number of units proposed and excessive number of prospective occupants within a purpose-built family sized dwellinghouse represents an overly intensive use of the site which would give rise to undue levels of noise and disturbance for the site's occupants and surrounding occupants at No. 61 Gayton Road and St James Court, 65 Gayton Road. The significant number of units proposed would result in an excessive subdivision of the rear garden of the site with the resulting garden appearing unduly cluttered and contrived, at odds with the established pattern of open gardens within the area. Furthermore, by reason of the significant number of units proposed, the proposal would require an excessive number of bins to be sited to the front forecourt of the site, unduly cluttering the front forecourt of the site and detracting from the overall level of visual amenity afforded along the street scene. The proposed development would therefore be contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies D3 D (1), D3 D (7) and D3 D (11) of The London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policies DM1 A, DM1 B  (c), (d) and (f) DM1 C, DM1 D (h), DM26 A (j), DM26 C, DM26 E, and DM27 A (c) of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010) and the Code of Practice for Storage and Collection of Refuse and Materials for Recycling in Domestic Properties (2016).",
    "Reason : 3 - Flats A and D would fail to meet the minimum overall GIA and built-in storage space requirements set out within the London Plan and Nationally Described Space Standards issued by the Department for Communities and Local Government on 27th March 2015. The proposed development would be inappropriately configured, with the bedspace of Flat C being sited directly below the living area of Flat E, giving rise to impacts of harmful noise transference. Furthermore, the living area of Flat 3 would be provided with poor levels of natural outlook with this space being served only by roof lights. The proposed development would thereby give rise to substandard and poor quality accommodation to the detriment of the residential amenities of the future occupiers. The proposal would therefore be contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework, Policies D3 D (7) and D6 F (1) of the London Plan (2021), and Policies DM1 C and DM26 A (a), (b), (c) and (d) and DM26 E of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013), the Mayor of London Housing Supplementary Planning Guidance (2016), Department for Communities and Local Government Technical Housing Standards - Nationally Described Space Standards (2015), and the adopted Supplementary Planning Documents Residential Design Guide (2010)."
