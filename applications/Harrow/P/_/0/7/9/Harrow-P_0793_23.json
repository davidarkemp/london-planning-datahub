    "Reason : 1 - The proposed first floor rear extension by reason of its excessive width, overall bulk, together with creation of a crown roof and the slight step to the side would fail to provide a proportionate, balanced, subordinate and harmonious addition to the host dwellinghouse, and would result in an overly dominant, obtrusive, and incongruous form of development that would subsume the rear elevation of the host property, and would fail to respect the character and appearance of the host dwellinghouse, neighbouring properties and the prevailing pattern of development in the locality contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D3 (D(1) and (11)) of The  London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 A, DM1 B (a), (b) and (c) of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010)."
