    "Reason : 1 - The cumulative impact of the proposed roof alterations including raising the roof ridge, the hip to gable, infill hip extension, dormer, crown roof and altered pitch angles, by reason of excessive bulk, scale, massing and poor design would result in an unsympathetic, incongruous, top-heavy and visually intrusive form of development that fails to respect the scale, proportions and design of both host building, would not be visually contained and would be out of character with the wider pattern of development and streetscene. This would be to the detriment of the character and appearance of the subject building, the wider pattern of development and visual amenities of the area, contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021) policy D3.D(1) and D3.D(11) of The London Plan (2021), policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012) and policy DM1 of the Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010)."
