    "Reason : 1 - .The proposed enlargements to the property by reason of their cumulative depth, overall scale in relation to the site plot, form a dominant, inappropriate and incongruous form of development, which would constitute overdevelopment of the site and substantially harm the form and proportions of the original dwelling, and the established and prevailing pattern of development in the locality, contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D3.D(1) and D3.D(11) of The London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013), and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed single storey rear extension by reason of its excessive rearward projection and its siting immediately adjacent to the northern shared boundary, would create an overbearing and visually prominent structure when viewed from the rear elevation and garden of no.52 Broomgrove Garden, which would result in a significant loss of light and outlook to the detriment of the visual and residential amenities of the occupiers of the adjoining property, contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D3.D(7) of The London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010)."
