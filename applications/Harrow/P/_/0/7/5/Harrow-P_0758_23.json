    "Reason : 1 - The details submitted in relation to conditions 3 (Levels), by reason of their failure to provide a site plan indicating both existing and proposed site levels along with cross sections of the front of property in relation to the highway boundary and access to the proposed development would thereby fail to ensure that the development would be satisfactory with regard to the safety of the highway, would achieve a suitable development with regards to its drainage, gradient and access. In the absence of such details, the proposal would be contrary to policies DM1 and DM10 of the Councils Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013).",
    "Reason : 2 - The details submitted in relation to conditions 4 (disposal of surface water), 5 (surface water attenuation) and 10 (disposal of sewage) by reason of failure to provide full details of drainage layout, any flow restrictions, SUDS including permeable paving, management plan for disposal of ground water and compliance with the Local Flood Risk Management Strategy would fail to demonstrate that the development would provide adequate on site drainage and SUDS to reduce and mitigate the effect of flood risk on site and provide adequate drainage facilities to serve the future development. The proposal is therefore contrary to policies DM9 and DM10 of the Development Management Policies Local Plan 2013.",
    "Reason : 3 - Insufficient information has been submitted in relation to condition 12 (Television Reception) to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority that the proposed development would ensure that any telecommunications apparatus and other plant or equipment that is required on the exterior of the buildings preserves the high quality design of the buildings and spaces and to ensure that the development achieves a high standard of amenity for future occupiers. The proposal is therefore contrary to  Policy D3 of The London Plan (2021), and Policies DM1 and  DM49 of the Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013).",
    "Reason : 4 - Insufficient information has been submitted in relation to condition 13 (Demolition and Construction Logistics Plan) to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority that the proposed development would minimise the impacts of construction upon the amenities of neighbouring occupiers  and to ensure that development does not adversely affect safety on the transport network. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy T3 of The London Plan (2021) and policies DM1 and DM43 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013)."
