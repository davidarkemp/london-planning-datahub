    "Reason : 1 - The proposal would result in self-contained, residential accommodation. Therefore, it would not have a purpose which is incidental to the enjoyment of the dwellinghouse and therefore it is not within the tolerances of Schedule 2, Part 1 Class E of The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 as amended.",
    "Reason : 2 - As per the submitted information, the outbuilding is an existing structure. The height of the outbuilding exceeds 2.5m and it is within 2 metres of the boundary of the curtilage of the dwellinghouse and therefore it is not within the tolerances of Schedule 2, Part 1 Class E.1 (e)(ii) of The Town and Country Planning General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 as amended. The existing outbuilding has not been granted planning permission either by virtue of Section 58 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 or Article 3 of The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015. The existing outbuilding is therefore considered to be unlawful and it has not been demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority that it would be immune from enforcement action.",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposal is not therefore a lawful development."
