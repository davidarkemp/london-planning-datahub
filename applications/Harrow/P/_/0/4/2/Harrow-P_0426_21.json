    "Reason : 1 - The proposal when taken with previous additions to the original dwelling (since 1948) represent a disproportionate addition to the dwelling house and therefore fails to meet any exceptions for development within the Green Belt and is inappropriate development by definition for which no very special circumstances have been demonstrated and fails to preserve the openness of the Green Belt, contrary to contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), Policy G2 of the London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1 F of the Harrow Core Strategy 2012 and policy DM16 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013). ",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposal, by reason of the proposed first floor habitable rear dormer windows at close proximity to the neighbouring garden land at Roxey, would give rise to actual and perceived overlooking, to the detriment of the residential amenities of these neighbouring occupiers, contrary to the overall aims of the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021), Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan 2013 (DMP) and the Council's Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide 2010 (SPD). ",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposal, by reason of its excessive mass, bulk and unsympathetic additions to the roof, would give rise to an unduly obtrusive form of development which would not be of high quality design and would fail to improve the character and appearance of the area, would have a harmful effect on the character and appearance of the host property and the area and would be detrimental to the character and setting of the Locally listed building and its significance.  The proposal would therefore be contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), Policies D3 and HC1 of the London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1.B and D of the Harrow Core Strategy 2012, Policies DM1 and DM7 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013), the Council's Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide and Locally Listed Buildings Supplementary Planning Document."
