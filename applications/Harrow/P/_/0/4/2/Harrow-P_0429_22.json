    "Reason : 1 - The proposed alterations and extension of the original roof to form a crown roof, together with the proposed two storey front extension, two storey side to rear extension and two storey rear extension, as well as the proposed rear dormer by reason of their combined excessive scale, bulk, poor roof design and sitting would give rise to an contrived and incongruous form of development and result in excessive and overly dominant extensions which would fail to respect the proportions and scale of the original dwellinghouse and would subsume the original dwellinghouse. In addition, the combination of the two storey front extension, two storey side to rear extension and new crown roof would appear as unduly dominant and unsympathetic when viewed along the street scene, detracting from the overall visual amenity afforded along the road. The proposal would thereby be contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D3.D(1) and D3.D(11) of The London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policies DM1 A and DM1 B. (a) and (b) of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010)."
