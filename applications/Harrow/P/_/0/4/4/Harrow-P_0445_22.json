    "Reason : 1 - The proposed alterations and extension of the original roof to form two end gables, together with the proposed two storey rear extension and the proposed gable roof form over the two storey side extension, by reason of their combined excessive scale, bulk and poor roof design would give rise to an contrived and incongruous form of development and result in excessive and overly dominant extensions which would fail to respect the proportions and scale of the original dwellinghouse and would subsume the original dwellinghouse. The proposal would thereby be contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D3.D(1) and D3.D(11) of The London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 B. (a) and (b) of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed single storey rear extension, by reason of its excessive depth and siting in relation to No.2 Furness Road, would result in an unacceptable loss of outlook to No.2 Road, to the detriment of the residential and visual amenities of the neighbouring occupiers at No. 2 Furness Road, contrary to policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010)."
