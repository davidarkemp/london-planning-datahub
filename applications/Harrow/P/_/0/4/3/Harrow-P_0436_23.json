    "Reason : 1 - The proposed rear dormer and hip to gable alteration to the main roof in conjunction with the pitch roof form of the existing two storey front addition which is considered to form a historic extension to the house would exceed the volume allowance of 50 cubic metres for the detached dwellinghouse. The proposed development would not therefore be within the tolerances of Schedule 2, Part 1, Class B and C of The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 as amended.",
