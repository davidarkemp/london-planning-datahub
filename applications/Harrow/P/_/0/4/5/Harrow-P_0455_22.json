    "Reason : 1 - The proposed first floor rear extension, due to the proposed flat roof design and size, would not relate well or harmonize with the design and appearance of the host dwelling or relate appropriately with the extant roof extensions. The proposal would result in an unsympathetic form of development which is bulky and unduly obtrusive to the detriment of the character and appearance of the host dwelling, contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D3 (D(1) and D(11)) of The London Plan (2021), policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed first floor rear extension, by reason of its excessive depth is overbearing, resulting in a loss of light and overshadowing and is detrimental to the visual and residential amenities of the occupiers of No.61 and 65 Southfield Park. The proposed development is contrary to the high quality design aspirations of The National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D3(D(7)) of The London Plan (2021), policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).\r\n"
