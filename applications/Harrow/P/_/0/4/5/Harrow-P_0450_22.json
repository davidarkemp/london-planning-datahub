    "Reason : 1 - The proposal by reason of the poor layout and siting of the communal external amenity space and space for storage of bins for the commercial and residential uses, the proposal would result in a cramped, discordant, awkward and poor form of development which does not enhance local context or respond well to local distinctiveness.  As such the proposal would fail to meet with the high-quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies D3.D (1, 6 & 11) of the London Plan (2021), Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Polices Local Plan (2013) and the Residential Design Guide Supplementary Planning Document (2010).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed studio unit, by reason of the poor layout and siting of the space for external amenity, and space for refuse storage for the existing commercial and existing and proposed residential units, and by reason of the siting of openings in relation to the existing and proposed uses on site, the internal layout of the studio unit, and subsequent loss of privacy and outlook, would result in a substandard quality of living accommodation to the detriment of existing and future occupiers, contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies D3.D (7),    D6.B, and D6.E of the London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 of the Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013), and the Adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010)."
