    "Reason : 1 - The proposed outbuilding at rear for use as gym / storage, by reason of its height, would create an out of character form of development which would fail to respond positively to local context, and would harm the character and appearance of the subject and adjoining dwellings. As such, the proposal would be contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), and would conflict with the aims and objectives of Policy D3. D (1) and (11) of the London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 of the Harrow DMP and the adopted SPD: Residential Design Guide (2010). "
