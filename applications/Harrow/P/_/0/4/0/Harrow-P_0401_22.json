    "Reason : 1 - The proposed first floor side extension and associated insubordinate roof, when viewed in association with the existing hip to gable roof extension and dormer, would result in a discordant, incongruous and ungainly cumulative addition to the dwelling, by reason of poor design, excessive bulk and massing, the creation of an unacceptable terracing effect and by virtue of the existing dormer no longer being visually contained would be to the detriment of  the character and appearance of the host dwelling and the local area, contrary to Policy D3 (D(1) and D(11)) of The London Plan (2021), policy CS1.B of the Core Strategy (2012), policy DM1 of the Development Management Policies (2013), and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed single storey rear extension and first floor rear extension, by reason of excessive rearward projection and siting, would be detrimental to the amenities of the neighbouring occupiers at No. 47 Cavendish Avenue, in terms loss of light, outlook, sense of enclosure and overshadowing, contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D3.D(7) of The London Plan (2021),  Policy DM1 of the Development Management Policies Local Plan document (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010)."
