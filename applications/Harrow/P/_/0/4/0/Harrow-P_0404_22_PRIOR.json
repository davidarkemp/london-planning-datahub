    "Reason : 1 - The total enlargement would extend beyond a wall forming a side elevation of the original dwellinghouse and adjoins an existing two storey rear extension, which would have more than a single storey, and the total height would exceed 4m. The proposal would therefore not be within the tolerances of Schedule 2, Part 1, Class A, A.1 (j)i, (j)ii and (ja) of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 as amended.",
    "Reason : 2 - The total enlargement would adjoin an existing two storey rear extension, would be within two metres of the boundary of the curtilage of the dwellinghouse, and the height of the eaves of the existing two storey rear extension would exceed 3 metres. The proposal would therefore not be within the tolerances of Schedule 2, Part 1, Class A, A.1 (i) and (ja) of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 as amended.",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposal, by reason of its extensive rearward projection, would be detrimental to the amenities of the neighbouring occupiers at No. 43 and 47 Hillbury Avenue contrary to Policy DM1 of the Development Management Policies Local Plan document (2013) and the relevant provisions of the adopted Harrow Supplementary Planning Document Residential Design Guide (2010)."
