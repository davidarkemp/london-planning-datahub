    "Reason : 1 - The proposed rear dormer would extend beyond the outside face of an external wall of the original dwelling house, and would not be constructed so that the eaves of the original roof are maintained or reinstated and the edge of the enlargement would not be less than 0.2 metres from the eaves, measured along the roof slope from the outside edge of the eaves.  The proposal is therefore not within the tolerances of Schedule 2, Part 1 Class B.2 (b) (i)(aa), (bb) and (b) (ii) of The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 as amended.",
