    "Reason : 1 - The  proposal, by reason of its siting, form, massing and bulk, in addition to its curved roof form and abundance of hardstanding, would represent poor quality design which would appear as a visually cramped form of over-development and would fail to respect, relate and respond to the character, appearance and pattern of development surrounding area, contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), policies 7.4B and 7.6B of The London Plan (2016), Policy D1 of the Draft London Plan (2019) Core Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012); Policy DM 1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).  ",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed dwellinghouses 6-9 by reason of their siting and proximity to the shared boundary and positioning of terraces on the first floor rear elevations and overall width and scale, would have an unacceptable overlooking impact and loss of outlook on the occupiers of 125-133 Whitchurch Lane, to the detriment of their visual and residential amenity, contrary to the Policy 7.6 of The London Plan (2016), Policy D1 of the Draft London Plan (2019), Policy DM 1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed dwellinghouses 1 and 2 by reason of their siting and proximity to the shared boundary, will prejudice the development of the site to the west contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2019) Policy 7.6B of The London Plan (2016), Policy DM 1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 4 - The proposed dwellinghouses 3-5, by reason of their siting and proximity to the shared boundary, will have an overbearing and enclosing impact to the garden area serving Dudley House to the north of the site to the detriment of the residential amenity of the occupiers of the flats, contrary to the Policy 7.6B of The London Plan (2016), Policy D1 of the Draft London Plan (2019), Policy DM 1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 5 - The proposal, by reason of the lack of windows in the rear and/or side elevation for dwelling houses 1-5 would result in a poor standard of living accommodation for future occupiers in regards to adequate levels of natural light and outlook to the upper floor rooms.  The proposal is therefore contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), Policies 3.5 and 7.6B of The London Plan 2016, Policy D4 of the Draft London Plan (2019) Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013), the adopted Supplementary Planning Document Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 6 - The proposal fails to demonstrate that adequate refuse storage to serve the development can be accommodated on the site to the detriment of the character and appearance of the area and residential amenity of the potential occupiers of the dwelling houses.  The proposal is therefore contrary to 7.4B and 7.6B of the London Plan (2016), Policy D4 of the Draft London Plan (2019), Core Policy CS1R of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012) and Policy DM1 of the Development Policies Local Plan (2013)."
