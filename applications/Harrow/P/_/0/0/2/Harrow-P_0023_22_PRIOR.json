    "Reason : 1 - 1.\tThe proposed single storey rear extension, by reason of its excessive rearward projection and its siting immediately adjacent to the boundary shared with the adjoining property No.11 Oxford Road, would result in an unacceptable loss of light, a loss of outlook and overshadowing. The proposal would therefore be detrimental to the visual and residential amenities of the occupiers of No.11 Oxford Road contrary to the high quality design aspiration of The National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D3 (7) of The London Plan (2021), policy DM 1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010)."
