    "Reason : 1 - The proposal, by reason of its siting and encroachment on private rear garden area, would constitute Garden Land Development and would be at odds with the Councils spatial strategy for growth and would therefore harm its implementation and sustainable growth of the Borough and would harm the contribution that gardens make to the character of the area, contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Core policies CS1.A and CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Garden Land Development (2013). \r\n\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposal, by reason of its back-land siting in the rear garden, subdivision of the existing rear garden of 142 Malvern Avenue and its habitable function, would represent an inappropriate form of development, at odds with the character of the area and the prevailing pattern of development in the locality, and would be detrimental to the visual amenities of the neighbouring occupiers when viewed from their private garden areas; and would result in an undue increased level of disturbance to the occupiers of the surrounding properties, contrary to Policy D3 (D(1), D(7) and D(11)) of The London Plan (2021), policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).\r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposal, by reason of its siting and cramped layout within its plot, would interrupt the strong front building line, would fail to provide a suitable setting for the dwelling, and a poor relationship with the neighbouring properties and the public pavement. In addition, by reason of the proposal�s poor design, siting and lack of relationship to the architectural pattern of the street and together with the proposed basement, would result in an incongruous and obtrusive development within the streetscene, which would be inappropriate in the context of the established open character of the properties in the area; and would be out of keeping with the distinctive pattern of local development. The proposal would therefore fail to comply with the high design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021),  policy  D3 (D(1) and D(11)) of The London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).\r\n",
    "Reason : 4 - The proposal, by reason of poor outlook to a sunken terrace for the bedroom within the basement  would result in a substandard quality of living accommodation for future occupiers  contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D6.C of the London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 of the Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013), The Mayor of London Housing Supplementary Planning Guidance (2016) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).\r\n"
