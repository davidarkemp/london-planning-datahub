    "Condition : 1 - I refer to your application dated 21 January 2010 and enclosures requesting non-material amendments as detailed below:\r\n\r\nPlanning Permission Reference:\tP/2412/06\r\nDate of Permission:\t3rd November 2006\r\nProposed Revisions:\t\"\tExternal surfaces of ground surfacing: change all external new paving from resin bound gravel in 'Autumn Tan' colour to Marshall's Perfecta paving slabs 450 x 450 mm in 'Buff' colour (inc Yorkstone Aggregates).\r\n\"\tChange from bicycle store to bicycle hoops (ref UE/RB from Sheffield Cycle Post).\r\n\"\tSimplified Terrace Layout.\r\n\"\tThree new planting beds adjacent to the house planted with Pyracantha.\r\n\r\nSubmitted Plans / Documents\t\"\tCycle Racks, Stands and Scooter Racks details - Colour RAL7024 Graphite Grey , Perfecta - Smooth Ground Concrete Paving details, 06/990/AL/1131, 06/990/AL114G, 06/953/AL/159B, 06/990/02 Rev D, Letter dated 14th January 2010 and Site Plan\r\nSuperseded Plans / Documents:\t06/990/02 Rev A\r\n",
    "Condition : 2 - I confirm that the following proposals are acceptable as non-material amendments to the planning permission noted above:\r\n\"\tChange from bicycle store to bicycle hoops (ref UE/RB from Sheffield Cycle Post).\r\n\"\tSimplified Terrace Layout.\r\n\"\tExternal surfaces of ground surfacing: change all external new paving from resin bound gravel in 'Autumn Tan' colour to Marshall's Perfecta paving slabs 450 x 450 mm in 'Buff' colour (inc Yorkstone Aggregates).\r\n",
    "Reason : 1 - I confirm that the following proposals are not acceptable as non-material amendments to the planning permission noted above. The proposal would fall outside the terms of section 96A of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990, resulting in a material change to the landscaping of the approved development granted under P/2412/06 for the following reasons: \r\n\"\tThree new planting beds adjacent to the house planted with Pyracantha.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlanting beds\r\n\r\nPlanting bed 2, to the rear of West House -  west elevation - adjacent to the car parking space.  \r\nThe proposed Pyracantha would be unsuitable along the length of the parking bay, since it is vigorous, large growing and spiky plant which would be in the way and could hurt someone getting out of a car.  The proposed Pyracantha would need to be set back in the planting bed and a lower growing and tough, evergreen ground cover plant should be proposed adjacent to the parking space.\r\n\r\nPlanting bed 3 on the plan \r\nThe proposed planting bed is too narrow.  The existing footpath width has been reduced to 1250mm.  The existing footpath width of 2250mm should be retained in order to enable the public to easily walk side by side and pass in both directions.  If a planting bed is required the existing footpath would need to be realigned out into the park, retaining the 2250mm width.  This change in the footpath would require discussions with and agreement of the parks department. The width of the planting bed and the gullies, manhole within, should also be reconsidered.\r\n\r\nDiversion of the existing footpath would require very careful consideration, particularly since there are existing trees at either end, and the Swamp Cypress with its large root network projecting above ground level.  Patrick Prendergast should be consulted about the trees, and Dave Corby in Parks.  \r\n\r\nThe applicant is advised that changes to the planting beds and the narrowing of the footpaths should be dealt with in a variation to condition application.  Please consult Sally Reeves, Landscape Architect.\r\n"
