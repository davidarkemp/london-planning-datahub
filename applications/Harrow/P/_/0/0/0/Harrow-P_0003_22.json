    "Reason : 1 - The proposed single storey front extension, by reason of its forward projection, design and prominent siting, would detract from the character of the streetscene, giving rise to an contrived addition which would be incongruous and out of keeping within the immediate streetscene and would therefore be inappropriate and out of character with the locality contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D3 (D(1) and D(11)) of The London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1 (B) of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed single storey side to rear extension, by reason of its excessive height, depth and overall excessive size would give rise to a disproportionate addition to the original dwellinghouse on site that would dominate and subsume the character and appearance of the existing dwellinghouse and would fail to respect the scale of the surrounding neighbouring dwellinghouses and pattern of development in the surrounding area, contrary to Policy D3 (D(1) and D(11)) of The London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1 (B) of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed single storey side to rear extension by reason of by reason of its excessive height, depth and overall excessive size would result in visually overbearing form of development and result in loss of outlook to the occupiers at no. 21 Pinner Hill and would therefore lead to detrimental impacts upon the residential amenities of these neighbouring occupiers, contrary Policy D3 (D(7)) of The London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1 (B) of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010)."
