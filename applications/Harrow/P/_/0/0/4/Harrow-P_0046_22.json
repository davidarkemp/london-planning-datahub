    "Reason : 1 - The applicant has failed to provide evidence of certification of Secure by Design accreditation as part of this application, which is the fundamental requirement for Condition No. 11 (Secure by Design). In failing to provide evidence of certification of Secure by Design accreditation, the Council cannot be satisfied that the development would be satisfactorily designed to restrict and prevent crime, contrary to S17 of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 (as amended), Policy D11 of the London Plan (2021) and Policy DM2 A (d) of the Councilï¿½s Development Management Polices Document (2013).",
    "Reason : 2 - The detail provided within the submitted Fire Safety Statement would not be satisfactory for the discharge of Condition No. 10 (Fire Safety Statement), with the statement failing to be supported by necessary plans, reading in a confusing way, and quoting many British Standards that do not relate to a domestic situation. In failing to provide a satisfactory Fire Safety Statement, the Council cannot be satisfied that fire risks for the new dwellinghouses would be satisfactorily managed, contrary to Policy D12A of the London Plan (2021).\r\n"
