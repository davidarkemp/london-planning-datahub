    "Reason : 1 - The width of the site shown on the proposed floor plan drawings is wider than that shown on the floor plan drawings for a previously refused application (P/4074/17/PRIOR) and is inconsistent with width measurements taken using the Council's GIS Mapping Software. In light of the contradictory information available in regard to the width of the site, it is considered that the developer has provided insufficient information to enable the council to establish whether or not the proposed development complies with the Condition set out within Condition A.4 (7) (b) of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "Reason : 2 - Due to inconsistencies in information available in regards to the width of the site, officers have undertake a worst case scenario residential amenity assessment, utilising the width of the site detailed for application P/4074/17/PRIOR. Following this, it has been conceived that the proposed extension, by reason of its excessive rearward projection and siting in relation to No. 7 and 11 Treve Avenue would give rise to an unduly dominant and overbearing form of development which would result in an unacceptable loss of outlook and visual amenity afforded to the rear garden and ground floor rear facing habitable room windows of these neighbouring properties. The proposed development would thereby be contrary to the Policy DM1 B. (a), DM1 C, DM1 D (d), (e), (f) of the Development Management Policies Local Plan document (2013) and the relevant provisions of the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010)."
