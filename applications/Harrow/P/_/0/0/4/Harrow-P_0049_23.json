    "Reason : 1 - The proposed two storey side and single and two storey rear extensions, by reason of their siting and excessive depths in relation to No. 90 St Andrews Drive would introduce an overly bulky and obtrusive form of development that would fail to respect the proportions of the existing dwellinghouse, and the character and appearance of the neighbouring properties and would give rise to overshadowing, loss of light, loss of outlook and an overbearing impact on the flank kitchen window serving No. 90, to the detriment of the character and appearance of the existing dwellinghouse, the adjacent dwellinghouses, and the residential and visual amenities of the occupiers of No. 90 St Andrews Drive, contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D3 D.1, D.7 and D.11 of The London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document Residential Design Guide (2010)."
