  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The first floor rear element of the extension, by reason of the fact that it would extend across the full extended width of the dwellinghouse and would incorporate an integrated roof form that would distort the roof profile and pitch of the original dwellinghouse, would form an unsympathetic addition to the host building, street scene and area, and would unduly impact upon the symmetry, proportionality and group value of the application site and No. 53 Barrow Point Avenue as a semi-detached pairing. The proposal would thereby be contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D3 (1) and (11) of The London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 A, DM1 B (a) and (b) and (c) of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The first floor rear element of the extension, by reason of its\r\nexcessive bulk, massing, rearward projection, height, siting in relation to No. 53 Barrow Point Avenue and failure to comply with the 45 Degree Code would give rise to an unduly dominant and overbearing form of development which would result in an unacceptable loss of daylight and outlook afforded to the rear garden and rear facing habitable room windows of No. 53 Barrow Point Avenue. Furthermore, the ground floor rear element of the extension, by reason of its excessive rearward projection, overall height, massing and siting in relation to Nos. 53 and 57 Barrow Point Avenue would also give rise to an unduly dominant and overbearing form of development which would result in an unacceptable loss of outlook and daylight to the rear gardens and ground floor rear facing habitable room windows of No. 53 and 57 Barrow Point Avenue. The proposed development would thereby be contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D3(7) of the London Plan (2021), Policy DM1 B. (a), DM1 C., and DM1 D. (d), (e) and (f) of the Development Management Policies Local Plan document (2013) and the relevant provisions of the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 3 - In the absence of a Flood Risk Assessment detailing proposed flood prevention and mitigation measures, and given the host dwellingï¿½s siting within a Critical Drainage Area and partly within a Flood Zones 3a, 3b, 3 and 2, officers cannot be satisfied that the development would not be susceptible to harmful flooding and would not unduly exacerbate flood risk elsewhere. The proposed development would thereby be contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies SI 12 B and C and SI 13 B of the London Plan (2021), Core Policies CS1.U and CS1.W of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), and Policy DM10 C and D of the Development Management Policies Local Plan document (2013)"
