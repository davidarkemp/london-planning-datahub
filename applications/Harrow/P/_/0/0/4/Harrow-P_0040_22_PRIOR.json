    "Reason : 1 - The application form and proposed elevations state that the eaves height of the proposed development would be 3m when measured from the natural ground level. However, as per the proposed drawings the eaves height is 3.1m when measured from ground level at the base of the outside wall. As such, the height of the eaves of the enlarged part exceeds 3m, while the enlarged part of the dwellinghouse is within 2 metres of the boundary of the curtilage of the dwellinghouse, Therefore, the proposed development does not comply with limitation A.1(i) to Class A of Part 1 (of Schedule 2) of The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015, as amended.",
    "Reason : 2 - The application form states that the proposed development would be 6m deep however, the submitted drawing (Drawing No. DRW-01PA) is annotated to confirm that the proposed development would be 5.25m deep. The developer has therefore provided inconsistent and incorrect information regarding the depth of the proposed development. The developer has therefore provided insufficient information to comply with limitation A.4(2)(a)(i) to Class A of Part 1 (of Schedule 2) of The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015, as amended. ",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed Side Elevation [B], (Drawing No. DRW-01PA) indicates the proposed development would include a raised platform. Therefore, the proposed development does not comply with limitation A.1(k(i)) to Class A of Part 1 (of Schedule 2) of The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015, as amended."
