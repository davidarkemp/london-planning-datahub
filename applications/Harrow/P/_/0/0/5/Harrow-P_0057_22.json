    "Reason : 1 - The proposed two storey side extension, by reason of its width and siting close to the common boundary with No. 41 Meadow Road would give rise to an incongruous and obtrusive form of development with inadequate space about the buildings and would detract from the established pattern of development of this part of Meadow Road, to the detriment of the character and appearance of the subject dwelling and the wider street scene. The proposal would therefore be contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D3 (D(1) and D(11)) of The London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed first floor rear in-fill extension and the two storey rear extension, together with the alteration to the roof over the original two storey rear outrigger and associated crown roof, by reason of their combined bulk, massing, unsatisfactory design, and poor assimilation with the original roof form results in an unsympathetic, incongruous, bulky, unduly prominent, and contrived form of development that the fails to respect the character, composition and design of the host dwelling, and unduly detracts from visual amenity afforded along the street scene. The proposal would thereby be contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D3.D(1) and D3.D(11) of The  London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 B. (a) and (b) of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010)."
