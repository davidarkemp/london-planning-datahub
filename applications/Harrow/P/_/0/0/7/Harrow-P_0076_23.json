    "Reason : 1 - The proposed boundary wall and gates would be sited within close proximity to a protected tree (labelled as T2 on Dwg No: LaVaasty/2023/319/02), and insufficient information has been provided to demonstrate that this tree and its roots would be appropriately protected during construction. Furthermore, the proposed expanded hardstanding to the front forecourt would extend over the Root Protection Area of another protected tree (labelled at T1 on Dwg No: LaVaasty/2023/319/02) and insufficient information has been provided to demonstrate that the roots of this tree would be appropriately protected. In the absence of sufficient information, the Council cannot be satisfied that the proposed development would have an acceptable impact on the health of the aforementioned protected trees. The proposed development would thereby be contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy G7(C) of the London Plan, and Policy DM22 A and C  of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013)."
