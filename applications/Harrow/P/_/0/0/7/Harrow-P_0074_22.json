    "Reason : 1 - As per the submitted floorplan the proposed outbuilding would be used for a living room and bedroom which constitutes primary living accommodation. Therefore, the proposed outbuilding by reason of its use for primary living accommodation would not be considered for purposes incidental to the enjoyment of the dwellinghouse.  As such, the proposal would not be within the tolerances of Schedule 2, Part 1, Class E of The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development)(England) Order 2015 as amended.",
    "Reason : 2 - Notwithstanding the first reason for refusal, the height of the proposed outbuilding would be 3.37m. Therefore, the proposed outbuilding would have  height which exceeds 2.5m, while being within 2m of the boundary of the curtilage of the dwellinghouse. As such the proposal would not be within the tolerances of E.1(e)(ii) of Class E to Part 1 (Schedule 2) of The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 as amended.",
    "Reason : 3 - Notwithstanding the first reason for refusal, the eaves height of the proposed outbuilding would be 2.7m when measured from the natural ground level. As such, the eaves height of the proposed outbuilding exceeds 2.5m and as such the proposal would not be within the tolerances of E.1(f) of Class E to Part 1 (Schedule 2) of The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 as amended.",
    "Reason : 4 - The proposal is NOT therefore a lawful development."
