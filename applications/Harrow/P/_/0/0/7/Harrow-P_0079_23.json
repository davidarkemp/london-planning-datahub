    "Reason : 1 - The proposed gates and piers, by reason of their unacceptable height, solid and fortress-like appearance and inappropriate suburban design would appear as an incongruous and visually obtrusive addition to the street scene. Additionally, the proposed hardstand tennis court with associated railings by reason of excessive cumulative hardstand coverage across the site and loss of soft landscaping would result in development which is out of character with wider pattern of development at neighbouring properties and the wider conservation area. As such the development represents an inappropriate form of development which would harm the openness and character of the Green Belt, and which would fail to preserve or enhance the character and appearance of the Pinner Hill Estate Conservation Area. Therefore the development is contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policy HC1, D3 and G2 of The London Plan (2021), policies CS1.B, CS1.D and CS1.F of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), policies DM1, DM6, DM7 and DM16 of the Development Management Policies Local Plan 2013 and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Pinner Conservation Areas ï¿½ Appendix 9: Pinner Hill Estate Conservation Area Character Appraisal and Management Strategy (2009)."
