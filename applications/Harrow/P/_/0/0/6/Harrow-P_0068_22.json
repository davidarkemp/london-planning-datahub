    "Reason : 1 - The first floor storey side to rear extension together with the hip to gable and rear dormer roof extensions, by reason of their excessive combined width, bulk, massing, the first floor side to rear element's failure to incorporate a sympathetic roof form, the first floor rear element's awkward and visually cluttered amalgamation with the rear dormer forms an incongruous, discordant, contrived, unduly bulky and dominant addition to the host dwelling and street scene. The development is therefore contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies D3.D(1) and D3.D(11) of The London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 A., DM1 B. (a), (b) and (c) of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 2 - The single storey front extension, by reason of its design and height forms an incongruous, discordant and dominant addition to the host dwelling. The  development is therefore contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies D3.D(1) and D3.D(11) of The London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 3 - The windows on the existing flank elevation of No. 41 Argyle Road, by reason of their sighting on the boundary with no defensible screening, gives rise to the effect of overlooking and invasion of privacy of No. 39 Argyle Road and therefore is to the detriment of current and future occupiers of No. 39 Argyle Road. The development is therefore contrary to Policy D3 (D(7)) of The London Plan (2021), Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010)."
