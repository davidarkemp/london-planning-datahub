Due to the inconsistent information provided, the Local Planning Authority is therefore unable to make an accurate determination whether the proposal would be within the tolerance of Schedule 2, Part 1, Class B, B.1(d)(ii) of The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development)(England) Order 2015 as amended.\r\n",
