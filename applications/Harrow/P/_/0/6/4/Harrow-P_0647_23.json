    "Reason : 1 - Notwithstanding the submitted application details, Council records show that the building known as 147 Eastcote Lane, Harrow HA2 8RR is currently in use as three self-contained flats. A lawful development certificate for this established use was granted under application reference P/4438/16 dated 30/11/2016. Whilst it is noted that planning permission was subsequently granted under application reference P/2877/21 dated 06/06/2021 for the conversion of three flats into one (4bed) dwellinghouse, the applicant has failed to provide evidence that this planning permission has indeed be implemented and the building is in use as a single family dwellinghouse. Furthermore, the Council Tax banding taken from the Valuation Office Agency website shows that the site comprises Flats 1, 2 and 3, 147 Eastcote Lane, Harrow HA2 8RR and has been in such use since October 2010.  In the absence of any substantial evidence to the contrary, the local planning authority considers that the site comprises three separate self-contained flats and for the purpose of the General Permitted Development Order 2015 (as amended), would not be considered a \"dwellinghouse\" as defined by the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended). Therefore, the permission granted by Schedule 2, Part 1 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended), \"Development within the curtilage of a dwellinghouse\" would not be applicable for the application site.",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposal is NOT therefore a lawful development."
