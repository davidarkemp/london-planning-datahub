T2: Golden Rain Tree (Koelreuteria paniculate) located on the lefthand side of the rear garden ??? Fell to ground level and poison stump by way of Eco Plugs to inhibit regrowth. T3: Bay (Laurus nobilis) located in the middle of rear garden ??? Reduce and shape canopy by approximately 2m in height and evenly reduce the lateral spread by approximately 2.25m. T4: Leaning Conifer (Cupressocyparis leylandii) located on the righthand boundary of the rear garden ??? Reduce weight out of lateral branches but retaining screening. T5&T6 2 x Conifer (Cupressocyparis leylandii) located on the back boundary of the rear garden ??? Reduce and shape canopy by approximately 2-2.5m to match height of neighbour???s trees and selectively prune lateral growth to contain and shape canopy retaining as much screening to the rear properties. T7&T8 2 x Conifer (Cupressocyparis leylandii) located in the middle of the rear boundary of the rear garden ??? Reduce and shape canopy by evenly reducing lateral spread by approximately 2-2.5m retaining maximum screening from the rear properties. T9: Sycamore (Acer pseudoplatanus) located on the lefthand side of rear boundary ??? Reduce and shape canopy by approximately 2m in height and evenly reduce the lateral spread by approximately 1-1.5m. Remove any major deadwood over 40mm.",
