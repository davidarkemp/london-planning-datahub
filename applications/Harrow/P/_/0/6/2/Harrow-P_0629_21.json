    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development by reason of its overall size, scale and massing, would be materially larger than the existing built form at the site, thereby representing an inappropriate form of development which would harm the openness and character of the Green Belt. The very special circumstances put forth fail to clearly outweigh the harm to the Green Belt by reason of inappropriateness or any other harm. As such, the proposal fails to comply with the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), policy G2 of The London Plan (2021), policy CS1.B and CS1.F of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), and policies DM1 and DM16 of Harrow Development Management Policies (2013).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed two storey rear extension, due to its size, scale, bulk and inappropriate design would be unduly obtrusive, would lack subservience and would be harmful to the character and appearance of the original dwellinghouse and its prevailing design feature. The proposal would significantly harm the character and adversely affect the appearance of the surrounding streetscene and the visual amenity of the Pinner Hill Estate Conservation Area and the Harrow Weald Ridge Area of Special Character. Accordingly, the proposal would be contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), policies D3 and HC1 of The London Plan (2021), policies CS1.B, CS1.D and CS6.A of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), policies DM1, DM6 and DM7 of Harrow Development Management Policies (2013), and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document:  Pinner Hill Conservation Area Appraisal and Management Strategy (2009)."
