    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development would not represent an effective use of land as it has been demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority that the application site is capable of delivering additional dwellings, which may or may not be able to make an appropriate provision for affordable housing. The proposal is therefore contrary to The National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policies D3(A) and (B) of The London Plan (2021) and policy CS1.J of The Core Strategy (2012).\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - Insufficient information has been submitted to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority that there would be sufficient facilities and access for the storage and collection of refuse for the proposed development. In the absence of such information the Local Planning Authority is not satisfied that the proposal would not result in a detrimental impact to the character and appearance of the wider area, contrary to the high quality design aspirations of The National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policy D3 (D(4)) of The London Plan (2021), policy CS1.B of The Core Strategy (2012), policy AAP4.A(j) of the Area Action Plan (2013), policies DM1(f) and DM45(a) and (b) of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 3 - \r\nThe proposed ground floor plan indicates that there is an existing disabled parking bay to the front of the building, however this does not reflect the site circumstances. Notwithstanding this, the proposed siting of the disabled parking bay is of insufficient size to accommodate a parking bay and furthermore would not have level access as it is adjacent to a kerb and a titan kerb. Therefore, the proposed accessible parking bay would be sub-standard and not fit for purpose. Therefore, it has not been demonstrated to the satisfaction of The Local Planning Authority that sufficient accessible parking spaces would be provided within the curtilage of the site. The proposal is therefore contrary to The National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policy T6 of The London Plan (2021) and policies DM1 and DM42 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013).",
    "Reason : 4 - Insufficient information has been submitted to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority that the location of the proposed accessible parking space(s) would not compromise on-site servicing and deliveries. The proposal is therefore contrary to The National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policy T6 of The London Plan (2021) and policies DM1.B(f) and DM42 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013).",
    "Reason : 5 - The proposed flat 4, due its insufficient floorspace would result in a cramped form of residential development which would not provide a satisfactory standard of residential accommodation for future occupiers. The proposed development is therefore contrary to the high quality design aspirations of The National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policy D6 of The London Plan (2021), policies DM1.C and DM1.D(g) of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document Residential Design Guide (2010)."
