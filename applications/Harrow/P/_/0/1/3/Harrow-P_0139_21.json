    "Reason : 1 - The proposed two-storey side extension, by reason of its bulk, scale, poor design and excessive width, in conjunction with its prominent siting, would give rise to an unsympathetic, incongruous, obtrusive and contrived form of development which would fail to respect the character, composition and design of the host and neighbouring properties and would significantly detract from the established and prevailing pattern of development in the area, to the detriment of the character and appearance of the subject dwellinghouse and the street scene, contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposal, by reason of the scale of the ground floor single storey rear extension in relation to the site plot and the formation of cramped and inappropriate sub-divided private amenity space(s) would result in a substandard quality of living accommodation to the detriment of the residential amenities of future occupiers of the residential units, a poor and inappropriate subdivision of the rear garden and  excessive enclosures that would be out of keeping with the character and pattern of development in the area, contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2019),  policies D3 and D6 of The London Plan (2021), policy CS1B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), policies DM1 and DM26 of the Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013), the Mayor of London Housing Supplementary Planning Guidance (2016) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010)."
