    "Reason : 1 - The single storey rear extension and overhang canopy by reason of its siting and significant rearward projection would appear highly intrusive, overbearing, would significantly increase the loss of outlook and enclosure to the detriment of the residential and visual amenities of the occupiers of the neighbouring property at No. 12 Streatfield Road. As such, the proposed development would be contrary to Policy D3.D (7) and (11) of the London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and guidance contained in the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010)."
