    "Reason : 1 -  The proposal would result in the additional dwellinghouse being sited on garden land. As such, the principle of the development is contrary to the Harrow Core Strategy of directing new residential and other development to the Harrow and Wealdstone Opportunity Area, town centres and, in suburban areas, to strategic previously developed sites and would therefore harm its implementation, contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies CS1.A and CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Garden Land Development (2013).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed single storey side extension, by reason of its excessive width, design, cramped siting and layout, would give rise to a disproportionate addition which would fail to provide a coherent pattern of development in the street scene, and would therefore unduly harm the form, openness and proportion of the site and relationship with the properties in the locality. The proposal would therefore be contrary to the high-quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies D3.D(1) and D3.D(11) of The London Plan (2021), Policy CS.1B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 of the Development Management Plan Local Policies (2013) and the Adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed single-storey dwelling, by reason of its front ward projection, would result in an overbearing, intrusive and dominant form of development that would substantially harm the amenities of no.5 Colmer Place by way of loss of outlook and light, visual intrusion and overshadowing, contrary to Policy D3 D (7) of The London Plan (2021), Policy DM1 of the Development Management Plan Local Policies (2013) and the Adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010)"
