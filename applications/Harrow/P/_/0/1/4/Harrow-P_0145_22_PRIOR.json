    "Reason : 1 - The total enlargement of the dwellinghouse would extend beyond an original side wall and exceed more than half the width of the original dwelling. The proposal would not be within the tolerances of Schedule 2, Part 1, Class A, A.1(j) (iii) and (ja) of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 as amended.",
    "Reason : 2 - The total enlargement of the dwellinghouse would have an eaves height which would exceed 3 metres and would be sited within 2 metres of the boundary of the curtilage of the dwellinghouse, therefore the proposal would not be within the tolerances of Schedule 2, Part 1, Class A, A.1 (i) of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015, as amended.",
    "Reason : 3 - Notwithstanding the above, the measurements provided in section 5 of the application form stating the proposed height to the eaves are inconsistent with the submitted drawings. Therefore, the local planning authority is unable to make an informed determination due to inconsistencies in information provided to comply with condition A.4(2)(a)(ii) and (iii) of Class A of Schedule 2, Part 1 of The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015, as amended."
