    "Reason : 1 - 1.\tThe proposed two-storey rear extension to no. 70 Graham Road and proposed first floor rear extension to no. 72 Graham Road, by reason of their overall design, excessive rear projection, bulk, scale, massing fails to provide proportionate, balanced, subordinate and harmonious additions to the host dwellinghouses which serve to introduce an overly dominant, obtrusive and incongruous form of development that subsumes the rear elevation of the host dwellinghouse and fails to respect the scale, character and appearance of the surrounding properties, the development is therefore detrimental to the character and appearance of the existing dwellinghouse and the adjacent dwellings, and the established and prevailing pattern of development in the locality contrary to policy D3 of the London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012),Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and guidance contained in the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 2 - 2.\tThe proposed first floor and two-storey rear extensions by reason of their siting, excessive depth and projection beyond the first floor habitable room windows of the host buildings at nos. 70 and 72 Graham Road, would result in a harmful impact on the amenities of these properties in terms of loss of outlook, daylight and an increased sense of enclosure. As such, the proposed development would be contrary to Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012),Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and guidance contained in the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010)."
