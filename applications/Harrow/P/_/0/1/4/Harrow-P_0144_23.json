    "Reason : 1 - The proposed hip to gable roof extension by reason of its scale, bulk and mass would appear as a disproportionate addition that would not respect the scale and proportions of the existing building, would represent a poor form of design which would appear incongruous and fail to integrate with the vernacular of the existing building. The proposed extension would appear as an unduly obtrusive and strident feature when viewed from the public highways of Boxtree Lane and Maricas Avenue, would unduly unbalance the pair of semi-detached properties it forms part of and would also be contrary to the character of the surrounding locality. The development therefore fails to meet the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), and is contrary to Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021), Core Strategy Policy CS1.B (2012), policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Harrow Supplementary Planning Document Residential Design Guide (2010)."
