    "Reason : 1 - The proposed front extension by reason of its attachment to the bay window and infilling the original recessed entrance to the dwelling, gives rise to an unsympathetic form of development that erodes the prominence of the bay window feature and the architectural interest of the pair of semi-detached dwellinghouses, to the detriment of the character and appearance of the host and attached neighbouring property, and the established and prevailing pattern of development in the locality contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D3.D(1) and D3.D(11) of The London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013), and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed rear ground floor flat (flat no.2), by reason of its shortfall in the minimum total gross internal area, and the siting of proposed windows serving the single person bedroom in close proximity to the northern site boundary and communal access, would result in a poor means of light, outlook and privacy and an overall cramped and substandard quality of living accommodation for the future occupiers and would fail to provide a fit for purpose residential unit of an appropriate design, quality and layout, contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies D3.D(7) and D6 of The London Plan (2021), policies DM1 and DM 26 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013), the Technical Housing Standards Nationally Described Space Standards (2015), the Mayor of London Supplementary Planning Guidance (2016), and the adopted Residential Design Guide Supplementary Planning Document (2010).\r\n\r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposal, by reason of its poor and unsatisfactory layout and stacking arrangement would result in a poor standard of living accommodation for future occupiers in regards to transmission of noise/general disturbance between the ground floor, first and second floor flats proposed. The proposal is therefore contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies D3 and D6 of The London Plan (2021), Policies DM1 and DM26 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document Residential Design Guide (2010). ",
    "Reason : 4 - The proposal, by reason of the narrow side access to the rear of the site, would prevent satisfactory access to use and store cycles impinging upon their functionality, and would undermine the provision of fit for purpose, secure and well-located cycle parking contrary to Policy T5 of the London Plan (2021), Policies DM1 and DM42 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Harrow Supplementary Planning Document Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 5 - The proposal, by reason of the visual clutter associated with the location of the refuse storage and recycling facilities within the forecourt of the site and the lack of provision of a positive street scene impact by the proposed forecourt, would unacceptably harm the character and appearance of the subject property and the locality, contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy CS1B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy D3 of The London Plan (2021), Policies DM1, DM23, DM26.C and DM45 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 6 - The proposed development by failure to provide adequate private amenity space for each flat would represent an overintensive use of the site and would result in a poor and inappropriate sub-division of the rear garden to the detriment of the residential amenities of future occupiers of the flats and would be out of keeping with the character and pattern of development in the area contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021),  policies D3 and D6 of The London Plan (2021), policy CS1B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), policies DM1 and DM26 of the Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013), the Mayor of London Housing Supplementary Planning Guidance (2016) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010)."
