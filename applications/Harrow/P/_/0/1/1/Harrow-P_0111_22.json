    "Reason : 1 - The proposed two storey side extension, by reason of its overall scale, siting and enclosure of the gap between the host dwelling and the boundary shared with No.83 Albury Drive, would fail to positively respond to the original architecture of the host building and adversely affect the overall detached character and appearance of the host dwelling and its contribution to the wider street scene, and would detract from the established pattern of development within the immediate area. As such, the proposal is therefore considered contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policy D3(D(1) and D(11)) of The London Plan (2021), policy CS1.B of The Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document Residential Design Guide (2010)."
