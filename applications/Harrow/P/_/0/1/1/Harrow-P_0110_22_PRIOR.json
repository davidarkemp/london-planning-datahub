    "Reason : 1 - The proposed enlargement of the dwellinghouse would extend beyond the rear wall of the original dwellinghouse by more than 6 metres, therefore the proposal would not be within the tolerances of Schedule 2, Part 1, Class A, A.1 (g) of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015, as amended.",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed enlargement of the dwellinghouse would extend beyond an original side wall and exceed more than half the width of the original dwelling.

    "Reason : 3 - Notwithstanding the above, the measurements provided in section 5 of the application form and the submitted drawings are inconsistent.
