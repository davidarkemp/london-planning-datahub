    "Reason : 1 - Within the context of the planning permission P/1783/21 dated 27/07/2021, the proposed development would be significantly different in its design, and would introduce various new elements of development, resulting in a material change to the character and appearance of the host dwelling, street scene and wider area, and would also result in a material change in impact on the residential amenities of adjoining neighbours and would have a materially different impact upon local biodiversity. It would therefore require re-consultation of neighbouring properties, and the proposal would need to be re-assessed against the requirements of Policies D3 and G6 of The London Plan (2021) and Policies DM1 and DM20 of the Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010). The proposal is therefore not considered to be non-material minor amendment."
