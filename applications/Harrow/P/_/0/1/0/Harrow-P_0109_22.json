  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - Within the context of the planning permission P/1103/11 granted on 03/11/2011, the proposed variation of conditions 7, 8 and 16 to increase the number of students and staff on the premise and inclusion of basic primary cooking facilities on site would fail to provide sufficient information that the proposal would not result in material changes to the host property and therefore it has not been possible for the local planning authority to confirm that the variation of conditions 7, 8 and 16 would accord with policies D3 (9) and HC1 of The London Plan (2021), policy CS1 of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012) and policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Polices Local Plan (2013). ",
    "Reason : 2 - In the absence of an Acoustic Report to demonstrate the impact of the increased activity within the premises and on the surrounding area, insufficient information exists for the Local Planning Authority to make a determination as to whether the proposal would result in unacceptable impact in terms of noise and nuisance and would fail to safeguard the amenity of neighbouring residents. The proposal would therefore fail to accord with policy D3 (9) and D14 of The London Plan (2021) and policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Polices Local Plan (2013). ",
    "Reason : 3 - The applicant has failed to provide a comprehensive Travel Plan to support a car free development and has failed to provide an adequate level of secure, sheltered and accessible cycle parking to account for the uplift of users of the premises. In the absence of which, the proposal could give rise undue transport impact which would compromise highway safety and promotion of sustainable modes of transport, contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies T5, T6, T6,2 and T6.5 The London Plan (2021) and Policies DM1 and DM42 and DM43 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013)."
