    "Reason : 1 - The proposed mansard roof in conjunction with the front and rear dormers, by reason of their overall bulk, scale, design and roof profile, results in an awkward, dominant and incongruous roof form that is of poor design and detracts from the character and appearance of the host building and the locality (including the adjoining properties which maintain hipped tiled roofs), contrary to the high quality design aspirations of National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D3.D (1 and 11) of the London Plan (2021), Policy CS1B of The Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 of Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposal, by reason of the lack of appropriate siting for refuse and cycle storage facilities,  would  give rise to additional clutter in the street and would fail to provide secure cycle parking which would encourage sustainable travel, to the detriment of the character and appearance of the area, the street scene and sustainable transport objectives, contrary to  the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policy D3 D (2), (4), (5), (7) and policy T5 A (2) of the London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policies DM1, DM45 and DM 42 F of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document Residential Design Guide (2010)."
