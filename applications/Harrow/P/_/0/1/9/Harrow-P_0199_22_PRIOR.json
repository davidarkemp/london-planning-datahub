    "Reason : 1 - The proposal demolition of the existing two-storey rear outrigger constitutes development within the meaning of Section 55 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended) and therefore requires planning permission and would fall outside  of the tolerances set out by Part 1, Schedule 2 Class A.1(g) of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development (England) Order 2015, as amended. \r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - Notwithstanding the first reason for the refusal, the proposed enlargement would be attached to the original two-storey rear projection and would therefore extend beyond a wall forming a side elevation of the original dwellinghouse and would have more than a single storey and have a width greater than half of the width of the original dwellinghouse. As such, the proposal would not comply with Part 1, Schedule 2, Class A.1(j)(ii),(iii), (b) and A.1(ja) of The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015, as amended."
