  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed two storey side extension, in conjunction with the front extension and existing additions, by reason of overall poor design (including unduly large scale, footprint and bulk and loss of chimney) would introduce an overly dominant, prominent, obtrusive and incongruous addition that subsumes the side elevation, and fails to respect the high quality, traditional character and appearance of the conservation area, and the prevailing pattern of development of the wider area. There is not clear and convincing justification for the heritage harm, nor public benefits to outweigh it, contrary to the requirements of NPPF. The development is therefore contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021) paragraphs 197, 199, 200, 202 and 206,  Policy D3 (D(1) and (11)) and HC 1 C of The  London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 A, DM1 B (a), (b) (c) and DM7 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010) and the adopted Stanmore and Edgware Conservation Areas SPD (December 2013) including appendix 1: Little Common Conservation Area Appraisal and Management Strategy.",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed large first floor windows and two high level rooflights within the rear roofslope would be highly visible within the conservation area from the rear garden of the Grade II listed Rookery and locally listed park resulting in an overbearing and obtrusive form of development which would result in a harmful impact on the these heritage assets. There is not clear and convincing justification for the heritage harm, nor public benefits to outweigh it, contrary to the requirements of NPPF. The development is therefore contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021) paragraphs 197, 199, 200, 202 and 206,  Policy D3 (D(1) and (11)) and HC 1 C of The  London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1 of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 A, DM1 B (a), (b) (c) and DM7 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010) and the adopted Stanmore and Edgware Conservation Areas SPD (December 2013) including appendix 1: Little Common Conservation Area Appraisal and Management Strategy.\r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed replacement front boundary treatment and additional vehicular access, by reason of proposed siting and poor design (including relatively tall height and formal posts, railings and electric gates), would introduce a hard and formal alteration that would likely in practice necessitate the loss of much of the existing characteristic soft landscaping that makes up the existing front boundary treatment that marks the edge of this conservation area. It would therefore introduce obtrusive and incongruous development that fails to respect the high quality, traditional and soft, informal character and appearance of this part of the conservation area, nor the prevailing pattern of development of the wider area. The proposal fails to provide a clear and convincing justification for the heritage harm, nor public benefits to outweigh it, contrary to the requirements of NPPF. The development is therefore contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021) paragraphs 197, 199, 200, 202 and 206,  Policy D3 (D(1) and (11)) and HC 1 C of The  London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1 of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 A, DM1 B (a), (b) (c) and DM7 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010) and the adopted Stanmore and Edgware Conservation Areas SPD (December 2013) including appendix 1: Little Common Conservation Area Appraisal and Management Strategy.\r\n",
    "Reason : 4 - The proposed extensions, front boundary wall and side stepped patio and new vehicular access and associated hardstanding adjacent to the two TPO trees within the front area of the property, by reason of their siting and associated groundworks would have a potential detrimental impact on the root protection zones of these two trees. As such, the proposal would be contrary to policy G7 of the London Plan (2021) and Core Policy CS1 of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM22 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013)."
