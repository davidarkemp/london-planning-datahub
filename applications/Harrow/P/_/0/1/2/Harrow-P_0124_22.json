    "Reason : 1 - Inconsistent information has been submitted in relation to the dimensions of the proposed roof extension. Therefore, the volume of the proposed roof extension cannot be accurately calculated to determine if the development would be within the tolerances of Schedule 2, Part 1, Class B, B.1 (d)(ii) of The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 as amended.",
    "Reason : 2 - Inconsistent information has been submitted in relation to the setback of the edge of the proposed roof extension from the eaves of the original roof. Therefore, the applicant has failed to demonstrate that the proposed development would be within the tolerances of Schedule 2, Part 1, Class B, B.2 (b)(i)(bb) of The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 as amended.",
