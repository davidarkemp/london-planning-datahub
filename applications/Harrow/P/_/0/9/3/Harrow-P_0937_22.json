    "Reason : 1 - The proposed gable end would be attached to the existing two storey side to rear extension, therefore the total enlargement, which includes the two storey  side to rear extension would extend beyond a wall forming a side elevation of the original dwellinghouse, would be within two metres of the boundary of the curtilage of the dwellinghouse, would have more than a single storey, would exceed 4 metres in height, and would have a width greater than half the width of the original dwellinghouse. The proposal would not be within the tolerances of Schedule 2, Part 1, Class A, A.1 (i) (j) and (ja) of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "Reason : 2 - The altered enlarged part of the dwellinghouse would have more than a single storey and the roof pitch of the enlarged part would not, so far as practicable, be the same as the roof pitch of the original dwellinghouse. The proposal would not be within the tolerances of Schedule 2, Part 1, Class A, A.3 (c) of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposal is NOT therefore a lawful development."
