    "Reason : 1 - It has not been demonstrated that the materials used in the facing flank elevations of the rear dormer, when viewed from ground level, would appear to be of similar colour and design to the materials used in the main roof of the subject dwellinghouse. The proposed dormer would not therefore be within the tolerances of Schedule 2, Part 1 Class B, Condition B.2 (a) of The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended)\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The window in the gable end which is an upper-floor window located in a wall forming a side elevation of the dwellinghouse is not obscure-glazed, and non-opening unless the parts of the window which can be opened are more than 1.7 metres above the floor of the room in which the window is installed The proposed window would not be within the tolerances of Schedule 2, Part 1 Class B, Condition B.2 (c) (i) and (ii).",
    "Reason : 3 - It has not been demonstrated that the two rooflights in the front roof slope would not protrude more than 0.15 metres beyond the plane of the slope of the original roof when measured from the perpendicular with the external surface of the original roof. It would therefore not be within the tolerances of Schedule 2, Part 1 Class C, C1 (b)",
