    "Reason : 1 - The proposal seeks to attain prior approval as described in Schedule 2, Part 1, Class A, Conditions A.4 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended). The existing dwellinghouse has been extended by way of a part single part two storey rear extension which does not benefit from planning permission and is unlawful. As such, the permission(s) granted by Schedule 2 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended) does not apply under Article 3 sub-paragraph (5) (a) of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "Reason : 2 - Notwithstanding the first reason for refusal, the total enlargement of the dwellinghouse would have an eaves height which would exceed 3 metres and would be sited within 2 metres of the boundary of the curtilage of the dwellinghouse, therefore the proposal would not be within the tolerances of Schedule 2, Part 1, Class A, A.1 (i) of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015, as amended.",
    "Reason : 3 - Notwithstanding the first reason for refusal, the enlarged part of the dwellinghouse would have more than a single storey and extend beyond the rear wall of the original dwellinghouse by more than 3 metres. The proposal would therefore not be within the tolerances of Schedule 2, Part 1, Class A, A.1 (h)(i) and (ja) of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 as amended.\r\n"
