    "Reason : 1 - The proposed conversion of the dwellinghouse into four flats and the sub-division of the rear garden into four separate amenity areas, would result in an overly intensive use of the site and a poor standard of living accommodation, to the detriment of the living conditions of the potential future occupiers of the flats and the character and appearance of the property and the area, contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policies D3 D (7) and (11) and D6 of The London Plan (2021), policies DM1, DM26 and DM27 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013), the Mayor of London Supplementary Planning Guidance Housing (2016), and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed flat 4 at loft level, by reason of its inadequate GIA and floor to ceiling height, and the lack of window to the bedroom, would result in a cramped and substandard of living accommodation with poor outlook to the bedroom, which would fail to provide a fit for purpose residential unit of an appropriate design, quality and layout for the potential future occupiers, contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies D3.D(7) and D6 of The London Plan (2021), policies DM1 and DM 26 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013), the Technical Housing Standards Nationally Described Space Standards (2015), the Mayor of London Supplementary Planning Guidance (2016), and the adopted Residential Design Guide Supplementary Planning Document (2010).",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed two storey side extension, by reason of its width and lack of appropriate gap from the side boundary and the resulting loss of the existing access, would prevent satisfactory access between the front and rear gardens, which would fail to adequately serve the functionality of the proposed development. The proposal would therefore fail to comply with high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policies D3.D(7) and D6  of The London Plan (2021), policies DM1, DM26A (f) and C and DM45 of the Harrow Development Management Policies (2013), and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).
