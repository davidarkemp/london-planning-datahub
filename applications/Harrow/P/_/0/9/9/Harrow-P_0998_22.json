    "Reason : 1 - Due to the discrepancies between the submitted and approved drawings the Local Planning Authority is unable to comprehensively assess whether the proposed soft and hard landscaping scheme would be effective in making a positive contribution to the character and appearance of the approved development. Furthermore, due to the proposed inclusion of an additional bed, it is not clear if there is sufficient space for the bin collection zone without causing an obstruction to the adjacent car parking space.  It has therefore not been demonstrated to the satisfaction of The Local Planning Authority that the proposal complies with policy D3.D(14) of The London Plan (2021), policy CS1.B of the Core Strategy (2012), policies DM1.B(d) and (f), DM22.B and DM23.A of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan 2013.\r\n\r\n"
