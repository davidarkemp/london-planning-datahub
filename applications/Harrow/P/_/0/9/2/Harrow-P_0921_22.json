    "Reason : 2 - The proposed development, by reason of an insufficient ecological appraisal and loss of SINC land and potential harm to trees of high amenity value, fails to demonstrate that biodiversity value of the site and character of the  surrounding area would not be harmed, protected or enhanced, contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policies G6  and G7 of the London Plan (2021) policy CS 1 E of the Harrow Core Strategy and  policies DM22, DM 20 and DM 21 of the Harrow Development Management Polices Local Plan (2013)."
