    "Reason : 1 - The proposed second entrance door, as included in the proposed single storey side extension, in conjunction with the layout and use of the single storey side extension, which would be able to function as primary habitable accommodation outside of the original dwellinghouse, would not be considered `ancillary' to the host dwellinghouse, giving rise to an incongruous form of development. Therefore the proposed single storey side extension would compromise the character and existing use of the property to the detriment of the host dwellinghouse and the established pattern of development in the area. The proposal would therefore be contrary to the aspirations of high quality design set out in the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D3 (D(1) and D(11)) of The London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1 (B) of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010)."
