    "Reason : 1 - The proposal adjoins the existing two storey side extension, resulting in a total enlargement within 2 metres of the boundary of the curtilage of the dwellinghouse, and height of the eaves exceeding 3 metres. The enlargement extends beyond an original side wall and exceeds more than half the width of the original dwelling. The proposal would not be within the tolerances of Schedule 2, Part 1, Class A, A.1 (i), (j) (ii)(iii) and (ja) of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 as amended.",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposal would extend beyond the original rear wall by more than 6 metres, therefore, the proposed development would not be within the tolerances of Schedule 2, Part 1, Class A, A.1 (g) (i), of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 as amended.",
    "Reason : 3 - Notwithstanding the above, the proposed maximum height and eaves height of the extension shown on the submitted drawings, are not consistent with those stated on the application form. As such, the proposed development is contrary to A.4(2)(a) and 3(b) to Class A of Part 1 (of Schedule 2) of The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015, as amended."
