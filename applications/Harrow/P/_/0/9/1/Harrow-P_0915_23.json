    "Reason : 1 - The proposed conversion of the dwellinghouse into four flats, by reason of the excessive number of occupiers that it accommodates, would result in an overly intensive use of the site and a poor standard of living accommodation to the detriment of the living conditions of the future occupiers. The proposed sub-division of the amenity space would result in over intensification of the use of the garden to the detriment of the character and appearance of the surrounding area, The development is therefore contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policies D3 D (7) and D6 The London Plan (2021), policies DM1, DM26 and DM27 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013), the Mayor of London Supplementary Planning Guidance Housing (2016), and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed ground floor flat, by reason of inadequate gross internal floor area and lack of internal storage, would result in a cramped and poor standard of living accommodation for the future occupiers, to the detriment of their residential amenities,  contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021), Policies DM 1 and DM 26 of the Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013), The National Housing Standards-Nationally Described Space Standards (2015), The  Mayor of London Housing Supplementary Planning Guidance (2016), and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed flat no. 4 at loft level, by reason of its shortfall inadequate floor to ceiling height in the loft floor, and the siting of proposed Velux window serving the single person bedroom , would result in a poor means of light, outlook an overall cramped and substandard quality of living accommodation for the future occupiers and would fail to provide a fit for purpose residential unit of an appropriate design, quality and layout, contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies D3.D(7) and D6 of The London Plan (2021), policies DM1 and DM 26 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013), the Technical Housing Standards Nationally Described Space Standards (2015), the Mayor of London Supplementary Planning Guidance (2016), and the adopted Residential Design Guide Supplementary Planning Document (2010)."
