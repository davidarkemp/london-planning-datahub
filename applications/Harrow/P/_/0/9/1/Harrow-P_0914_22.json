    "Reason : 1 - The applicant has failed to submit a comprehensive and detailed soft and hard landscaping plan, planting plan and implementation programme, has failed submit details of all hard boundary treatments to front and rear, and has provided inadequate bin storage details contrary to the requirements of Condition 8 of planning application reference P/0903/21 (dated 1/7/21). The applicant has therefore failed to demonstrate that the proposal would make appropriate provision of hard and soft landscaping to contribute to a high standard of design, layout and amenity, and does not make appropriate provision for the protection, enhancement, creation and management of biodiversity contrary to The National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policies D3.D(1), D3.D(10) and G6(D) of the London Plan (2021), policy CS1.B and CS1.R of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), policies DM1.A, DM1.B(d)(e)(f); DM22(B) and DM23(C), DM45(C) of the Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013), the Code of Practice for the Storage of Waste in Domestic Properties (2016), and the Supplementary Planning Document - Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed cycle store, due its provision of a single cycle store on land relating to one of the properties is an unacceptable arrangement for two individual dwellings and would fail to provide appropriate separate, accessible and secure cycle parking for those dwellings. Furthermore, the proposed siting of the cycle store within the front garden would be unsightly and would reduce the opportunities for soft landscaping resulting in a detrimental impact to the character and appearance of the approved dwellings and the surrounding area. The proposal fails to adequately comply with the requirements of Condition 7 of P/0903/21 (dated 1/7/21) and is therefore contrary to the high quality design aspirations of The National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policies T5, D3(10) and D3(14) of The London Plan (2021), policy CS1.B and CS1.R of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), policy DM1.A, DM1.B(d)(e)(f), DM22(B), DM23(C) and policy DM42(F) and policy of The Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the Supplementary Planning Document - Residential Design Guide 2010."
