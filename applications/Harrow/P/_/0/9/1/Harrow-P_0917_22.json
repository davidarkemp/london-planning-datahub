    "Reason : 1 - The proposed front porch, alterations to the existing side extension and the proposed roof alterations by reason of their height, scale and obtrusive design would form an unsympathetic and incongruous form of development which would be of detriment to the established and prevailing pattern of development, erode the built form and character of the original property and undermine the continuity and openness of the Canons Park Estate Conservation Area. No public benefits have been demonstrated nor clear and convincing justification have been provided and therefore the proposal would therefore be detrimental to the host property and would harm the character and appearance of the Canons Park Estate Conservation area, contrary to National Planning Policy Framework (2021)  policies HC1 and D3.D(1) and (11) of The London Plan (2021), policies CS1.B and CS1.D of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), policies DM1 and DM7 of the Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013), the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010) and Canons Park Estate Conservation Area Appraisal and Management Strategy (2013)."
