    "Reason : 1 - The proposed flats, due to the lack of natural light, outlook and adequate amenity space for the newly proposed flat, as well as the shortfall in Gross Internal Area and lack of outlook, privacy and defensible space for the extended flat, would result in an unsatisfactory, cramped and oppressive quality of living conditions for future occupiers of these units, which would fail to provide adequate safety and security and sufficient privacy, contrary to policies D6 and SD6.(K) of The London Plan (2021),  policy CS.1 of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), policies AAP4 and AAP13 of the Harrow and Wealdstone Area Action Plan (2013),  policies DM1, DM2 and DM27 of the Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013), the Mayors Supplementary Planning Guidance: Housing (2016), and the adopted Supplemental Planning Document Residential Design Guide (2010).\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed development, by reason of the loss of the disabled car parking spaces, would fail to provide a suitable quality of accessible residential accommodation and would be likely to result in overspill parking in the local town centre area. Furthermore, the proposed cycle storage, by reason of its inadequate quantity, quality and practical functionality, in particular given the town centre location, would be likely to result in detrimental impacts to the local highways and undermine sustainable transportation. The proposal would therefore be contrary to policies D5, T.5, and T.6.1 of The London Plan (2021), policy AAP19 of the Harrow and Wealdstone Area Action Plan (2013), and policy DM42 of the Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013).\r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed development, by reason of the proposed layout and combined storage with bicycles, would result in an unsatisfactory and impractical waste storage arrangements that would be likely to result in inappropriate storage of waste and overspill of waste onto public areas, to the detriment of the health and safety of current/future occupiers and neighbouring occupiers and businesses, and would result in unacceptable impacts to the character and appearance of the property and the streetscene, contrary to policy D3.D(1) and D3.D(4) of The London Plan (2021),  policy CS.1 of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), policy AAP4 of the Harrow and Wealdstone Area Action Plan (2013),  policies DM1 and DM45 of the Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplemental Planning Document Residential Design Guide (2010).\r\n"
