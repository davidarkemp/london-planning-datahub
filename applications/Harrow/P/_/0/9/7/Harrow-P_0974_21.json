    "Reason : 1 - In the absence of a section 106 agreement or Unilateral Undertaking to prevent the proposed development being implemented in conjunction with extant planning permission P/0200/21, dated 25th March 2021,  the proposal would give rise to excessive disproportionate additions over the size of the original dwellinghouse and would constitute inappropriate development in the Green Belt, to the detriment of the character, appearance and openness of the Green Belt, contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policy G2 of The London Plan (2021), Core policy CS 1 F of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), and policy DM 16 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013), and no very special circumstances have been demonstrated by the applicant whereby the harm by reason of inappropriateness is outweighed by other considerations."
