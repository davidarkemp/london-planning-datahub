    "Reason : 1 - The proposal would extend beyond the rear wall of the original dwellinghouse by more than 3 metres in the case of an end of terrace property and is therefore not within the tolerances of Schedule 2, Part 1 Class A.1 F (i) of The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 as amended.",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposal fails to demonstrate that the proposed window in the gable end shall be obscure-glazed, and non-opening unless the parts of the window which can be opened are more than 1.7 metres above the floor of the room in which the window is installed and is therefore not within the tolerances of Schedule 2, Part 1 Class B, B.2 C (i)(ii)  of The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 as amended.",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed porch would be more than 3 metres above ground level and is therefore not within the tolerances of Schedule 2, Part 1 Class D.1 C of The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 as amended.",
    "Reason : 4 - The proposal is therefore NOT a lawful development."
