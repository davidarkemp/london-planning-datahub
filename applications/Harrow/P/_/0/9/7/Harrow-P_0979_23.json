As such, the drawings are inaccurate and therefore the Local Planning Authority is unable to make an accurate and comprehensive assessment as to whether the proposed single storey rear extension would be within the tolerances of Schedule 2, Part 1, Class A, A.1 (b) of The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development)(England) Order 2015 as amended.",
