    "Reason : 1 - The proposed single storey rear extension wraps around the existing two storey rear outrigger and would therefore cumulatively extend beyond the rear wall of the original dwellinghouse by more than 6 metres and would extend beyond an original side wall and exceed more than half the width of the original dwelling. The proposal would not be within the tolerances of A.1(g)(i) and A.1 (j) (iii) and (ja) to Class A of Part 1 (of Schedule 2) of The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015, as amended."
