    "Reason : 1 - The proposed single storey rear extension, by reason of its siting as shown in drawing no. 11211-AG-100 Rev B and 11211-A-901 Rev B, would extend beyond the curtilage of the dwellinghouse. The proposal would therefore fail to comply with the requirements of Schedule 2, Part 1, Class A of The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 as amended.",
    "Reason : 2 - From the plans submitted, the proposed maximum height and eaves height of the extension shown on the submitted drawings differs to what has been stated on the application form, as such, the local planning authority is therefore unable to make a comprehensive and objective assessment of the proposed development.  The proposed development is therefore contrary to A.4(2)(a) and 3(b) to Class A of Part 1 (of Schedule 2) of The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015, as amended."
