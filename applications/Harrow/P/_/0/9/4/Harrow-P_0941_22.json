    "Reason : 1 - The proposed two storey side extension and associated insubordinate roof,when viewed in association with the proposed hip to gable roof extension, and insufficient set-back from the front elevation at first floor level, would result in a discordant, incongruous and ungainly cumulative addition to the dwelling, by reason of poor design, excessive bulk and massing, and the creation of an unacceptable terracing effect, to the detriment of the character and appearance of the host dwelling and the local area, contrary to Policy D3 (D(1) and D(11)) of The London Plan (2021), policy CS1.B of the Core Strategy (2012), policy DM1 of the Development Management Policies (2013), and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposal would, by virtue of its flat roof design of the first floor rear extension, fail to reflect the character and appearance of the host dwelling and therefore is of an unsatisfactory form of design and appearance. The proposal therefore results in an incongruous form of development to the detriment of the character and appearance of the host building and wider area, contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1 (B) of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), policy DM 1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).\r\n",
