    "Reason : 1 - The proposal would result in the new dwellinghouse being sited on garden land. As such, the principle of the development is contrary to the Harrow Core Strategy of directing new residential and other development to the Harrow and Wealdstone Opportunity Area, town centres and, in suburban areas, to strategic previously developed sites and would therefore harm its implementation, contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D3 of The London Plan (2021), Policies CS1.A and CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012) and the Adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Garden Land Development (2013).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed new dwellinghouse by reason of its overall scale, massing and its rear projection would form a disproportionate and dominant addition and would have a harmful impact on the overall character and appearance of the surrounding area and would appear out of keeping with the character and appearance of the pattern of development within the immediate area consisting of modest terrace dwellings. As such the proposal would be contrary to policy Policy D3 of The London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013).",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed new dwelling by reason of its siting, excessive depth and projection beyond the rear wall of the adjacent property at no. 1 Mead Road, would result in a large physical presence and cause a harmful impact on the amenities of the adjoining property in terms of loss of outlook, overshadowing and an increased sense of enclosure. As such, the proposed development would be contrary to Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021), Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and guidance contained in the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010)."
