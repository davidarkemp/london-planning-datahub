    "Reason : 1 - The proposed enlargements of the side dormers, together with the extension of the eastern dormer over the existing two storey side extension, by reason of their scale, bulk, unsympathetic roof design and  prominent siting would be an overbearing incongruous addition that represents poor quality design resulting in disproportionate additions to the original building which would be out of character with the established pattern of development within the existing estate. The development is therefore contrary to the high quality design aspirations set out in the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policy D3 (D(1) and D(11)) of The London Plan (2021) and policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management "
