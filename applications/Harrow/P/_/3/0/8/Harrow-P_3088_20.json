    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development would have a greater impact on the openness of the Green Belt than the existing development on the application site.  The proposed development would therefore constitute inappropriate development in the Green Belt, to the detriment of the character, appearance and openness of the Green Belt, contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policy G2 of The London Plan (2021), Core policy CS 1 F of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), and policy DM 16 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013), and no very special circumstances have been demonstrated by the applicant whereby the harm by reason of inappropriateness is outweighed by other considerations.",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed development, by reason of failure to provide adequate on-site or off site car / coach parking and lack of integrated drop off facilities to serve the proposed banqueting facility, would significantly intensify site usage and generated trips. The associated likely on site congestion and parking overspill into the London Borough of Harrow and the London Borough of Barnet, with particular reference to the residential streets to the south-east of the site, is therefore considered to be detrimental to highway and pedestrian safety, and the amenities of neighbouring occupiers, contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy T4 of The London Plan (2021),  and policies DM 42 E and F, DM 1 B (f) (C) and D (h), policy DM 42 E and F and DM 43 B and C of the Harrow Development Management policies Local Plan (2013).",
