    "Reason : 1 - The decking by reason of its incompatible bulk and excessive scale,  appears obtrusive and incongruous, and does not respect the form and appearance of the original and existing building to the detriment of the special character and appearance of the locally listed building, and fails to preserve or enhance the character or appearance of Brookshill Drive and Grimsdyke Estate Conservation Area. The proposal is therefore contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), Policies 7.4B, 7.6B, 7.8C and 7.8D of The London Plan (2016), Policies HC1, D1 and D4 of the Draft London Plan Intend to Publish Version, Core Policies CS1B and CS1D of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policies DM1 and DM7 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013), the adopted Supplementary Planning Document Residential Design Guide (2010) and the Harrow Weald Park Conservation Area Appraisal and Management Strategy (2014).\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The development results in a disproportionate addition to the original building and constitutes inappropriate development in the Green Belt, and no very special circumstances have been demonstrated that the harm, by reason of inappropriateness is outweighed by other material considerations. The proposal therefore gives rise to harmful development in the Green Belt, contrary to National Planning Policy Framework (2019), policy 7.16 of The London Plan (2016), policy G2 of The Draft London Plan Intend to publish (2019), policy CS1.F and of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012) and policy DM16 of the Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013). ",
    "Reason : 3 - It has not been demonstrated that the use of the rear decking area is not detrimental or otherwise to the amenity of the occupiers of nearby residential premises.  The proposal is therefore contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), policy 7.6B of The London Plan (2016), Policy D1 of the Draft London Plan - Intend to Publish and policies DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013)."
