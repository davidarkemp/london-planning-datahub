    "Reason : 1 - The proposed front dormer roof extension, reason of its siting, bulk, massing, unsatisfactory design, use of unsympathetic external materials and failure to be adequately set back from the eaves, sides and ridge of the front roof slope results in an unsympathetic, incongruous, bulky, unduly dominant and contrived form of development that fails to respect the character, composition and design of the host dwelling and prevailing pattern of development along the street scene. The proposed front canopy together with the existing ground floor front extension would form an unduly prominent, incongruous and unsympathetic addition to the host dwelling and street scene that would excessively alter the host dwelling from its original appearance. The new first floor flank hallway window by reason of its excessive size and detailing would fail to appropriately reflect the character and appearance of the dwellinghouse's existing windows thereby forming an incongruous, unsympathetic and contrived addition to the host dwelling and street scene. The proposal would thereby be contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D3 (1) and (11) of The  London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 A, DM1 B (a), (b) and (c) of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010)."
