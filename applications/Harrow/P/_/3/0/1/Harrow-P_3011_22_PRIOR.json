    "Reason : 1 - The developer has measured the maximum height of the roof eaves of the proposed single storey rear extension from the rear patio and not from natural ground floor level. The developer has therefore provided incorrect information on the proposed maximum eaves height, contrary to condition A.4(2)(a.iii) of development permitted by Class A.1(g) to Part 1 (of Schedule 2) of The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015, as amended",
    "Reason : 2 - In light of the above reason for refusal, the eaves height of the proposed single storey rear extension would be more than 3 metres in height within 2 metres of the side boundary. This is contrary to condition A.1(i) of development permitted by Class A.1(g) to Part 1 (of Schedule 2) of The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015, as amended.\r\n"
