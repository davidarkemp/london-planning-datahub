    "Reason : 1 - The development, by reason of the poor roof designs and discordant heights of the ground floor side, ground floor rear and front porch extensions,  the proximity of the first floor side extension to the side shared boundary, the excessive width of the first floor rear extension, and the combined bulk and massing of these extensions where they would attach to the existing hip to gable and rear dormer roof forms, would dominate and subsume the proportions of the subject dwelling, and would result in a loss of space about the building at first floor level, failing to enhance local context and respond to local distinctiveness, contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021, Policy D3 (D(1) and D(11)) of the London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013), and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 2 - The development, by reason of the scale and bulk of the existing rear dormer window and proposed first floor side to rear extensions, along with the poor and obtrusively designed first floor and loft level rear windows, would fail to preserve the significance and special character of the Canons Park Conservation Area and the Grade II Listed Registered Park and Garden. There is not clear and convincing justification for the harm, nor public benefits to outweigh this harm. The proposed development is therefore contrary to the requirements of paragraphs 197, 199, 200 and 202 of NPPF (2021), Policies D3.D (1), D3.D (11) and HC1 of The London Plan (2021), Policies CS1.B and CS1.D of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policies DM1 and DM7 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013), the Adopted Supplementary Planning Document Residential Design Guide (2010) and the Canons Park Conservation Area Appraisal and Management Strategy (2013)."
