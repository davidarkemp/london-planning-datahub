    "Reason : 1 - The proposed two-storey rear and single storey rear extensions, by reason of their excessive rear projection, bulk, scale and massing fail to provide proportionate, balanced, subordinate and harmonious additions to the host dwellinghouse which serve to introduce an overly dominant, obtrusive and incongruous form of development that subsumes the rear elevation of the host dwellinghouse and fails to respect the scale, character and appearance of the surrounding properties, the development is therefore detrimental to the character and appearance of the existing dwellinghouse and the adjacent dwellings, and the established and prevailing pattern of development in the locality contrary to Policy D3.D (11) of The London Plan 2021, Core Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed single and two storey rear extension by reason of it's siting to the south, excessive depth and rearward projection would result in a large physical presence and cause a harmful impact on the amenities of the adjoining property at no. 100 Langland Crescent in terms of loss of outlook, overbearing impact, loss of light and an increased sense of enclosure. As such, the proposed development would be contrary to Policy D3.D (7) of the London Plan (2021),  Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and guidance contained in the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).",
