    "Reason : 1 - The proposed first floor rear extension, in conjunction with the existing extensions to the dwellinghouse when cumulatively assessed, by reason of excessive bulk and inappropriate design would completely subsume and result in an unduly bulky, disproportionate addition to the dwellinghouse which would not be sympathetic to the character and appearance of the original dwellinghouse and the streetscene, contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2019),  policies 7.4 and 7.6 of The London Plan (2016), policies D1 and D3 of the Intend to Publish Draft London Plan  (2019), policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed first floor rear extension in conjunction with the existing extensions to the dwellinghouse would result in an unduly bulky addition in close proximity to the boundary with No. 19 Woodridings Avenue which would lead to an excessively overbearing impact, unacceptable loss of visual amenity and outlook to this neighbouring property, contrary to policy 7.6 of The London Plan (2016), policies D1 and D3 of the Intend to Publish Draft London Plan  (2019), policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).\r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed single storey side extension and its close proximity to the nearby protected tree, would give rise to detrimental harm on the treeï¿½s form, appearance and health in the long term and potentially diminish its overall amenity value as demonstrated by the submitted Arboricultural information and would be likely to result in the harm to the character and visual amenity of the site and the surrounding area, contrary to policy 7.21 of the London Plan (2016), policy G7 of the Draft London Plan (2019) and policy DM22 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013).\r\n"
