    "Reason : 1 - The proposed part single part two storey front extension and associated alterations to the roof form of the dwellinghouse, would result in an unduly obtrusive, disproportionate, insubordinate and incongruous addition to the original dwellinghouse and would unbalance the pair of semi-detached properties that the site forms part of, and would excessively alter the dwellinghouse from its original form and appearance. The proposal would thereby be contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D3 (D(1) and D(11)) of The London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 A, DM1 B (a), (b) and (c) of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010)."
