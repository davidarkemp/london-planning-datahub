    "Reason : 1 - The proposed single storey ground floor front extension in conjunction with the proposed roof alterations, due to it's forward projection, siting and poor design would undermine the character of the host property and would be out of keeping with the high quality design of the dwellinghouse and pattern of development in the locality and no public benefits have been demonstrated to outweigh the harm nor clear and convincing justification provided.  The proposal would therefore be detrimental to the host property and would harm the character and appearance of the Stanmore Hill Conservation area, contrary to National Planning Policy Framework ( 2021)  policies HC1 and D3  D (1) and (11) of The London Plan (2021), policy CS1.B  and CS1.D of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), policy DM1 and DM7 of the Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013), the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010) and Stanmore Hill Conservation Area Appraisal and Management Strategy."
