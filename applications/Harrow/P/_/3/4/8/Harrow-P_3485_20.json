    "Reason : 1 - The proposed single storey front extension, by reason of its siting and design, would appear as a bulky and unsympathetic addition that would obscure the original architectural detail of the subject dwellinghouse and would materially harm the character and appearance of the subject property. The proposal would fail to respect the established pattern of development in the locality contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), Policies  7.4B and 7.6B of The London Plan (2016), Policy CS1B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 of the Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013), the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010)."
