    "Reason : 1 - 1.\tThe proposed development due to its inappropriate design, excessive height, bulk, scale and massing would be visually dominant and overbearing, resulting in an incongruous addition to the streetscene which would be detrimental to the character and appearance of the local area and the immediate low rise suburban townscape of West Harrow. The proposal is therefore contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2019),  policies D3, D4 and D9 of the London Plan (2021), policy CS1 of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012) and policy DM1 of the Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013).",
    "Reason : 2 - 2.\tThe proposed development due to its excessive height, bulk and mass would result in a detrimental impact on the setting of the nearby Harrow on the Hill Conservation Areas and protected views of St. Mary's Church, a Grade I listed building from Harrow Recreation Ground. The proposed development is therefore contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), policies HC1 and HC4 of The London Plan (2021), policy CS1 of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), policies DM1, DM3 and DM7 of the Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the Harrow on the Hill Conservation Areas Supplementary Planning Document including its appendices of Conservation Area Appraisal and Management Strategies.",
    "Reason : 3 - 3.\tThe proposed development, due to its design, excessive height, bulk, scale and extent of glazing would result in a dominating and overbearing presence to the close neighbouring residential properties to the west on Vaughan Road and south of the site (24 Bessborough Road) and would give rise to a perception of overlooking of these neighbouring dwellings and their gardens. The proposed development is therefore contrary to the high quality design aspirations of The National Planning Policy Framework (2019), policy D3 of the London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1 of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), and policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013)."
