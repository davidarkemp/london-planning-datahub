    "Reason : 1 - The proposal would result in the additional dwellinghouse being sited on garden land. As such, the principle of the development is contrary to the Harrow Core Strategy of directing new residential and other development to the Harrow and Wealdstone Opportunity Area, town centres and, in suburban areas, to strategic previously developed sites and would therefore harm its implementation, contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies CS1.A and CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Garden Land Development (2013).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed new dwelling, by reason of its excessive width, scale, proportions and siting appears contrived, cramped and out of keeping with the existing dwellinghouse (No.9) and the wider pattern of development, to the detriment of the character and appearance of the streetscene, and the pattern of development within the surrounding area. The proposal would therefore be contrary to the high-quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies D3.D(1) and D3.D(11) of The London Plan (2021), Policy CS.1B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 of the Development Management Plan Local Policies (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed development, in the absence of any information demonstrating sufficient floor to ceiling heights, would create a poor standard of living accommodation for future occupiers to the detriment of their residential amenity. As such, the proposal is contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies D3.D(7) of The London Plan (2021), Policy CS1 of the Harrow Core Strategy (2013), and policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013), the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide Supplementary Planning Document (2010)."
