    "Reason : 1 - The proposed canopy structure, associated posts and railings providing outdoor seating for the restaurant use by reason of their siting within the forecourt, design and scale would result in a harmful impact on the character and appearance of the host building and the surrounding area, and would detract from the prevailing pattern of development within the surrounding area and would not achieve an inclusive, legible pedestrian\r\nenvironment. The proposal would therefore be contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policy D3.D(11) of the London Plan (2021), policy CS1B of the of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), policies DM1 and DM2.C of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013).\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed outdoor seating by reason of its use and hours of operation would potentially give rise to unreasonable levels of noise disturbance for ex-isting occupiers of the upper floor level residential properties of the host building and surrounding residential properties, contrary to policies D3.D(7) and D14 of The London Plan (2021) and policy DM1 of the Harrow Devel-opment Management Policies Local Plan 2013."
