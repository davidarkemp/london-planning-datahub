    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development, by reason of its height and siting in close proximity to the habitable room windows within the rear elevation of the care home situated to the south of the site, would represent an overbearing, visually dominant and obtrusive form of development, which would result in loss outlook and an increased sense of enclosure, to the detriment of the residential and visual amenity of the adjacent occupiers of the care home, contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D3.D.7 of the London Plan (2021), Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the  adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010) .",
    "Reason : 2 - The applicant has failed to demonstrate that the proposed development would not result in unacceptable impacts on the tree adjacent to the rear site boundary. The proposal is therefore contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy G6 of the London Plan (2021), and Policy DM22 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013)"
