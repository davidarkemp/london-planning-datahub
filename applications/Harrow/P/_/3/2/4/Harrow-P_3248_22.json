    "Reason : 1 - The proposed single storey side extension and bay window, by reason of its excessive width, siting and site coverage and poor design would introduce an incongruous, overly dominant, bulky and disproportionate form of development that would fail to respect the scale, character and appearance of the host dwellinghouse and that of the surrounding neighbouring properties, to the detriment of the character and appearance of the host dwellinghouse and the prevailing pattern of development in the locality and street scene, contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policies D3 (1), (11) and (12) of The London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document Residential Design Guide (2010).\r\n"
