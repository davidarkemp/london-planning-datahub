    "Reason : 1 - The proposed dwellinghouse, by reason of its siting in the rear garden of No. 86 Spencer Road would be at odds with the Council's spatial strategy for growth and directing new residential and other development to the Harrow and Wealdstone Opportunity Area, town centres and, in suburban areas, to strategic previously developed sites and would therefore harm its implementation, contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021),    Policies CS1.A and CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Garden Land Development (2013).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed dwellinghouse, by reason of its layout, siting, scale, massing, and appearance would give rise to a cramped, obtrusive, contrived and incongruous addition, which would represent an inappropriate form of development, out of character with the pattern of development in the locality, and would amount to overdevelopment of the site and fail to represent a high quality of design, harmfully detracting from the surrounding pattern of development and the character and appearance of the locality, contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D3. D (1 and 11) of The London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed dwellinghouse, by reason of its scale, massing, siting in close proximity to the site boundaries, would lead to an overbearing impact and loss of outlook, and result in overshadowing and overlooking of the host and neighbouring properties, to the detriment of the residential and visual amenities of the occupiers, contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policy D3. D (7) of the London Plan (2021), policy DM 1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010)."
