    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development, by reason of insufficient and inaccurate information in relation to the existing accommodation within the building, the local planning authority has been unable to make a comprehensive assessment in relation to the minimum gross internal floor space standards, floor to ceiling heights and  vertical stacking arrangements between the proposed  and existing accommodation and  it has therefore not been demonstrated that the proposal would give rise to an acceptable standard of quality of living accommodation for the future occupiers and would provide residential units of an appropriate design, quality and layout, contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D6 of The London Plan (2021), policies DM1 and DM 26 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013), the Mayor of London Supplementary Planning Guidance (2016), and the adopted Residential Design Guide Supplementary Planning Document (2010) and the Technical Housing Standards Nationally Described Space Standards (2015)."
