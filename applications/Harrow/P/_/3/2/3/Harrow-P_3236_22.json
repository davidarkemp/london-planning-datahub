    "Reason : 1 - The proposed change of use, by reason of the resulting loss of retail floorspace to the ground floor retail unit, the resulting inability to service the retail unit from the rear, failure to provide sufficient information to justify how the reconfigured retail unit would be appropriately serviced, and why the retail floor space being lost would be surplus to requirements and would not unduly limit the operation of the retail unit, would result in a development that would unduly impact upon the vitality and viability of the ground floor retail unit and non-designated parade of which the application site forms part of. The proposed development is thereby considered to be contrary to The London Plan Policy E9.F, Core Policy CS1.M of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), and Policy DM38.B of the of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed unit would be provided with unsatisfactory levels of natural outlook and ventilation with the unit being served by a single window which provides poor quality views of the rear service road and is located a significant distance away and appears to be screened from view from the unit�s kitchen area, providing poor natural outlook and ventilation to this space. The proposed development would therefore give rise to substandard and poor quality accommodation to the detriment of the residential amenities of the future occupiers of the unit contrary to policies D3 D (7) and D6 C of The London Plan (2021), policies DM1 C, DM1 D (f) and (g) of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013), the Mayor of London Housing Supplementary Planning Guidance (2016), Department for Communities and Local Government Technical Housing Standards - Nationally Described Space Standards (2015), and the adopted Supplementary Planning Documents Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed change of use, by reason of the resulting inability to service the retail unit from the rear service road would result in the unit only being serviceable from the front. Owing to the fact that there are double yellow lines along Pinner Green and Pinner Hill Road directly to the front and side of the site, and given that the front forecourt of the site is inaccessible by large serving and delivery vehicles, arrangements for deliveries and servicing for the modified retail unit would likely have a harmful impact upon pedestrian and vehicular safety and the flow of traffic along Pinner Green and Pinner Hill Road. Furthermore, the development has failed to provide sufficient details of how waste from the retail unit would be managed.  The proposed development would thereby by contrary to Policies DM38.A (b), DM44.C and DM45 of the of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013)."
