  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - Having regard to the individual circumstances of this proposal, being sited within a visually prominent corner location, by virtue of its poor design, siting and scale, the proposed front porch extension and alterations to the fenestration of the dwellinghouse are considered to represent an inappropriate form of development that would fail to harmonise well with the host dwelling, or that of its adjoining neighbours property, which would ultimately result in an adverse impact upon the character and appearance of the street scene and locality. If permitted, the development proposal would be overly dominant, obtrusive and incongruous, therefore detrimental to the character and appearance of the existing dwellinghouse and the adjoining dwelling, and the established and prevailing pattern of development in the locality contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D3.D(11) of the London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the Council's adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed site layout by reason of the amount of excessive hardstanding and associated car parking provision for the host building within the rear garden diminishes the useable private amenity space resulting in a poor standard of accommodation for occupiers. As such, the proposal is contrary to Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and guidance contained in the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010)."
