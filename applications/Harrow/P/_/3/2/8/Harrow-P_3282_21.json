    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development by reason of its excessive scale, bulk and poor design, including the inappropriate eaves height over the two storey side extension, would give rise to a dominant, contrived and incongruous form of development which would subsume the original dwellinghouse and fail to respect its proportions, scale and character. The proposal would have a detrimental impact to the character and appearance of the original dwellinghouse and the surrounding area, especially given its exposed, corner plot location. The proposal is contrary to the high quality design aspirations set out in the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policy D3 (D(1) and D(11)) of The London Plan (2021), policy CS1.B on the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), policy DM1 of the Development Management Local Plans Policies (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).\r\n"
