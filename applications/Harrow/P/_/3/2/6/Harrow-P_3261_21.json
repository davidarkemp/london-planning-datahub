    "Reason : 1 - The existing outbuilding, by reason of its form, height and its siting within the existing front garden, introduces a poor and obtrusive form of development which does not respond positively to local distinctiveness, and does not satisfactorily relate to its surroundings and its local context. The development therefore fails to meet the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), and is contrary to Policy D3. D (1) and (11) of The London Plan (2021), Core Strategy Policy CS1.B (2012), Policy DM 1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Plan (2013), and the Harrow Supplementary Planning Document - Residential Design Guide (2010).",
