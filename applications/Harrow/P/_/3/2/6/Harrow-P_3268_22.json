    "Reason : 1 - The proposed first floor side to rear extension, by reason of its excessive bulk and rearward projection, and unsatisfactory design would be unduly obtrusive, appearing overly dominant, and would be detrimental to the character and appearance of the subject dwelling and the locality, and would be detrimental to the visual and residential amenities of the occupiers of the adjacent property, 27 Carlton Avenue, and is contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies D3.D (7) and (11), Core Policy CS1. B of the Harrow Core Strategy, Policy DM1 of the Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013), and the Adopted Supplementary Planning Document; Residential Design Guide (2010).\r\n",
