    "Reason : 1 - The proposed first floor side extension, by reason of its inappropriate design in conjunction with the presence of the previous hip to gable extension to the roof profile of the subject property and its prominent siting, would result in an incongruous and unsympathetic addition which would detract from the character and appearance of the host property, the streetscene, and the established pattern of development in the locality, contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), Policies D1 and D3 of The Draft London Plan (2019), Policies 7.4B and 7.6B of The London Plan (2016), Core Policy CS1B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013), and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document Residential Design Guide (2010)."
