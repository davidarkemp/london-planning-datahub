    "Reason : 1 - The proposed additions and alterations to the dwelling house at ground and first floor level in conjunction with the existing extensions, by reason of poor design and cumulative scale would result in excessive bulk, scale and massing and an incongruous development which would wholly subsume the proportions of the original dwellinghouse and would be harmful to the character and appearance of the host dwelling and the wider South Hill Conservation Area and special character area, contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021),  Policies D3(D(1) and D(11)) and HC1 of The London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1 (B) of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policies DM1, DM6 and DM7 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010)."
