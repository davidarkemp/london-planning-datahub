    "Reason : 1 - The development by reason of its poor design, unsatisfactory roof form, varied fenestration in the rear elevation, and excessive widths of the front porch and the two storey rear extension, would result in visually obtrusive, unduly bulky, incongruous and contrived from of development, which would subsume and erode the traditional built form of the original semi-detached pair of properties and the pattern of developments in the locality, to the detriment of the character and appearance of the subject and adjacent dwellings, and the Canons Park Estate Conservation Area, contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies D3 .D(1) and D3 .D(11) and HC1.C of The London Plan (2021), Core Policies CS1 (B) and (D) of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), policies DM1 and DM7 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013), the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010) and the Canons Park Conservation Area Appraisal and Management Strategy (2013)."
