    "Reason : 1 - The proposed enlargement by virtue of its attachment to the existing single storey side and rear extension, would cumulatively, extend beyond a wall forming a side elevation of the original dwellinghouse and would have a width greater than half of the width of the original dwellinghouse. As such, the proposal would not comply with limitations set out under A.1 (j)(iii) and A.1 (ja) to Class A of Part 1 (of Schedule 2) of The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015, as amended.\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The applicant has not demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority that the maximum height and the eaves height of the proposed single storey rear extension has been measured from the natural ground level. The developer has therefore provided insufficient information to enable the authority to establish whether the proposed development fully complies with the limitations A.1(i), A.4(2)(a.ii) and A.4(2)(a.iii) of development permitted by Class A.1(g) to Part 1 (of Schedule 2) of The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015, as amended."
