    "Reason : 1 - The proposed single storey rear extension, due to the proposed use of rendering material as an external material would not be compatible or relate well to the host dwelling and would therefore detract from the character and appearance of the original dwellinghouse and its surrounding area. The proposal is therefore contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D3 (D)(1) and D(11)) of The London Plan (2021), Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013), and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document Residential Design Guide (2010).
