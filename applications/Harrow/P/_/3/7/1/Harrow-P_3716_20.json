    "Reason : 1 - The proposal would result in the additional dwellinghouse being sited on garden land. As such, the principle of the development is contrary to the Harrow Core Strategy of directing new residential and other development to the Harrow and Wealdstone Opportunity Area, town centres and, in suburban areas, to strategic previously developed sites, and would therefore harm its implementation, contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), Policy 3.5.A of The London Plan (2016), Policies CS1.A and CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012) and the Adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Garden Land Development (2013).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed dwelling, by reason of its form, height, width and its siting within the plot and proximity to the side boundary, would introduce a cramped and discordant form of development which would be at odds with the predominant character and pattern of development in the street scene, harmful to the character and appearance of the dwelling No 54 Kenmore Avenue and adjoining dwellings, and would be harmful to the character of the street scene. As such the proposal would fail to meet with the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), Policies 7.4B and 7.6B of The London Plan (2016), policy D3 of the Draft London Plan (2019) Intend to publish, Policy DM1 of the Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013), and the Adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010)."
