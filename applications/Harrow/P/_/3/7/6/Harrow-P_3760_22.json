  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposal would result in the new building being sited on garden land. As such, the principle of the development is contrary to the Harrow Core Strategy of directing new residential and other development to the Harrow and Wealdstone Opportunity Area, town centres and, in suburban areas, to strategic previously developed sites and would therefore harm its implementation, contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies CS1.A and CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Garden Land Development (2013).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed new building, by reason of its excessive; height, width, bulk, scale, massing, footprint, lack of sufficient separation from the site's front and eastern side boundaries, and its poor assimilation with surrounding buildings in terms of its scale, form and detailed design would form an incongruous, unsympathetic and contrived form of development, which results in an overdevelopment of the site, appears unduly prominent when viewed along the street scene, and would fail to be in keeping with the prevailing pattern of buildings within the Roxborough Park and the Grove Conservation Area and Area of Special Character within which the application site is located. Furthermore, by reason of the building's excessive height and scale, it would be visible in context with surrounding Grade II listed buildings at Heathfield (Peterborough Road), Farthings (Peterborough Road), Chalgrove (Peterborough Road), The Haven (Grove Hill), The Gables (Grove Hill), White Tops (Grove Hill), the William Douglas Caroe War Memorial, in addition to the adjacent locally listed building at Grove End (Grove Hill) and the locally listed park and garden at Grovefields. By reason of its unsympathetic scale and design in context with these surrounding heritage assets, the proposed development would result in substantial harm upon their settings. The adverse character and design impacts of the proposal are compounded by its failure to provide a sufficient amount of soft landscaping to the front of the proposed building. The proposal would thereby be contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies D3 D(1), D3 D(11) and Policy HC1 C of the London Plan (2021), Core Policies CS1.B, CS1.D and CS3.A of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policies DM1 A, DM1 B (a), (b), (c), (d) and (e), DM6 A (a), (b), (c), DM6 C, DM7 A, DM7 B (a), (b), (c), DM7 D (a), (b), DM7 (E) (a), DM22 B, and DM23 C of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local P",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed new building, by reason of its excessive height, bulk, scale, massing, and proximate siting in relation to the rear gardens of Grove End (Grove Hill) and Chalgrove (Peterborough Road), would appear as unduly overbearing and unneighbourly when viewed from these neighbours' gardens and would result in harmful overshadowing of these spaces, unduly impacting upon the overall level of visual amenity afforded. Furthermore, by reason of the building's excessive height, bulk, scale, massing and lack of sufficient separation distance from Grove End (Grove Hill), Chalgrove (Peterborough Road), The Haven (Grove Hill), and Farthings (Peterborough Road), the proposed building's associated upper floor rear facing habitable room fenestration and rear terraces are considered to enable harmful overlooking of the rear gardens of these neighbouring properties, unduly restricting privacy afforded to occupants and resulting in a loss of enjoyment of their gardens. The proposed development would thereby be contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D3 D(7) of The London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policies DM1 C and DM1 D (a), (b), (d), (e), and (f) of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 4 - The proposed development would fail to provide sufficient private outdoor amenity space for Flats 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7, with Flats 2, 4 and 6 not being provided with any private outdoor amenity space, and the private terraces for Flats 3, 5, and 7 failing to meet the minimum prescribed standards set out within the London Plan and the Mayor of London's Housing SPG (2016). Flat 1 would provide a sufficient quantum of amenity space to the rear, however this is not appropriately private. As a result of the above, prospective occupants of Flats 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 would be provided with a substandard form of accommodation. The development's provision of communal amenity space to the rear would not be satisfactory in overcoming the under provision of private outdoor amenity space. The proposed development would thereby be contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D6 F(9) of The London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1.K of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policies DM1 C, DM1 D (i), and DM27 A and C of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010), and the aforementioned Mayor of London Housing SPG (2016).",
    "Reason : 5 - The development's proposed refuse enclosures by reason of their prominent siting to the front of the building along a very narrow frontage with limited screening by soft landscaping, would result in a harmful visual cluttering of the development and street scene, detracting from the overall level of visual amenity afforded within the Roxborough Park and the Grove Conservation Area and Area of Special Character within which the application site is located. Furthermore, the storage capacities of the proposed refuse enclosures would fail to meet the waste storage needs of prospective occupants as prescribed by the Council's Code of Practice for the Storage and Collection of Refuse and Materials for Recycling in Domestic Properties (2016). The proposal would thereby be contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies D3 D(1), D3 D(11) and SI 7A (6) of The London Plan (2021), Core Policies CS1.B and CS1.X of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policies DM1 A, DM1 B (f) and DM45 A (a) and (c) of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010), and the aforementioned Code of Practice for the Storage and Collection of Refuse and Materials for Recycling in Domestic Properties (2016).",
    "Reason : 6 - Insufficient details have been provided in regard to the proposed development's Compensatory Flood Storage, drainage layout, flow restriction, Sustainable urban Drainage Systems, permeable paving, the disposal of groundwater during the construction phase, and the development's compliance with the Council's Local Flood Risk Management Strategy. In failing to provide this information, the applicant has failed to demonstrate that the proposed development would not exacerbate the risk of flooding within the site or increase the risk and consequences of flooding elsewhere. The proposal would thereby be contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy SI 12 C and SI 13 of the London Plan (2021), Policy CS1.U and CS1.W of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM9 A, DM9 B and DM10 A, C and D of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013), and the aforementioned adopted Local Flood Risk Management Strategy (2016)."
