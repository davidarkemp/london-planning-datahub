    "Reason : 1 - The proposal would result in the development being sited on garden land and would exceed the footprint of what is considered to be appropriate enlargements. As such, the principle of the development is contrary to the Harrow Core Strategy of directing new residential and other development to the Harrow and Wealdstone Opportunity Area, town centres and, in suburban areas, to strategic previously developed sites and would therefore harm its implementation, contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies CS1.A and CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Garden Land Development (2013).\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposal, due to excessive scale, massing, siting and detailed design, would be an unduly bulky, incongruous and out of scale development which is inappropriate in massing, at odds with the character of the area and the prevailing pattern of development in the streetscene on the southern side of Eastcote Lane and would be harmful to the visual amenity of neighbours. Furthermore, the proposed siting of the cycle store within the front garden would be unsightly and would reduce the opportunities for soft landscaping resulting in a detrimental impact to the character and appearance of the surrounding area.  The development is therefore contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies D3.D(1), D3.D(7) D3.D(10), D3.D(11), D3.D(14) and T5 of The London Plan (2021), policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), policies DM1 and DM23 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposal, by reason of poorly located and designed private open space, lack of information relating to the quantum and quality of communal open space and lack of defensible space in front of ground floor windows, would create a poor standard of living accommodation for future occupiers to the detriment of their residential amenity and would fail to be informed by Secured by Design principles. Additionally,  by reason of excessive bulk, scale, massing, overbearing impact and the potential for overlooking or perception of overlooking, the development would have an have an unacceptable impact on the residential amenities in terms of outlook, sense of enclosure and overbearing impact on the neighbouring property at No.149 Eastcote Lane. contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D3.D(7) of The London Plan (2021), Policy CS1 B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2013), policies DM1 and DM23 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013), the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide Supplementary Planning Document (2010).",
    "Reason : 4 - The development, by reason of cumulative impact of poorly sited car parking, and excessive hardstand with the potential for use as car parking spaces and poorly located front cycle store/racks would reduce opportunities for soft landscaping and will prioritise vehicle access and parking over walking and cycling and could exceed the maximum parking requirements of the London Plan, prejudice highway safety and diminish the convenience of pedestrians and cyclists, contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies T4, T6 and T6.1 of The London Plan Policy and Policy DM42 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013).\r\n",
    "Reason : 5 - The proposal fails to provide information relating to the provision and location of adequate waste storage for the proposed dwellings. It has therefore not been adequately demonstrated that the development will provide satisfactory storage volume to meet the general, recycling and organic waste material arising from the site, contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D6.E of The London Plan (2021), Policy CS.1X of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policies DM1, and DM45 of the Development Management Plan Local Policies (2013) and the Adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010)."
