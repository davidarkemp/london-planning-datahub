    "Reason : 1 - The proposed first floor rear extension together with the existing ground floor rear projection that it sits on top of, by reason of their excessive combined bulk and massing, and  prominent sitting at the corner of Northolt Road and Eastcote Road would form incongruous, overbearing and visually obtrusive additions to the host building, street scene and wider area; at odds with the established pattern of development within the locality. The proposed development would thereby be contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies D3 D(1) and D3 D(11) of The London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 A, DM1 B. (a), (b) and (c) of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed first floor rear extension , by reason of its height, bulk, massing, excessive rearward projection, proximate siting in relation to the first floor rear kitchen window of No. 249 Northolt Road, its failure to comply with the Council's 45 Degree Code in respect to this neighbouring property, and including the proximate siting, height and depth of the handrails associated with the extension's access steps; would result in undue loss of outlook to this neighbour's first floor rear kitchen window. The proposal would thereby be contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D3.D(7) of The London Plan (2021), Policy DM1 C, DM1 D (d), (e) and (f) of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 3 - In the absence of proposed section drawings detailing the internal head heights of units, the Council cannot be satisfied that prospective occupants would be provided with sufficient internal head heights. The proposed development would therefore give rise to substandard and poor quality accommodation to the detriment of the residential amenities of the future occupiers of the units contrary to policies D3 D (7),  D6 F (8) of The London Plan (2021), DM1 C and DM1 D (g) of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013), the Mayor of London Housing Supplementary Planning Guidance (2016), Department for Communities and Local Government Technical Housing Standards - Nationally Described Space Standards (2015), and the adopted Supplementary Planning Documents Residential Design Guide (2010)."
