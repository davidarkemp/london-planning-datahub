    "Reason : 1 - The proposal, by reason of the rearward projection of the single storey rear extension in conjunction with the limited space available and layout of the private amenity areas, would result in a cramped, substandard, deficient and poor quality amenity area for the residential units and would harmfully detract from the established character and prevailing pattern of development within the immediate locality, to the detriment of the character and appearance of the surrounding area and the residential amenities of the future occupiers, contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), policies 3.5, 7.4B and 7.6B of The London Plan (2016), D6 of the Publication London PLan (2020), Core Policy CS1B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), policies DM1, DM26 and DM27 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document Residential Design Guide (2010).\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - It has not been sufficiently demonstrated that the positioning of the cycles and refuse and waste storage can be accommodated to the side of the proposed one bedroom flat and it would not have a negative impact on the character and appearance of the street scene.  The proposal is therefore contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), Policy 7.4B and 7.6B, of The London Plan (2016), policies D6 and T5 of the Publication London Plan (2020). policy CS1B of the Harrow Core Strategy, policies DM 1 and DM 26 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013), and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide Supplementary Planning Document (2010)."
