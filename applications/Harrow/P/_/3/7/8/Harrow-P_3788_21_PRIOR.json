    "Reason : 1 - The total enlargement would have more than a single storey, would be within two metres of the boundary of the curtilage of the dwellinghouse, and the height of the eaves of the enlarged part would exceed 3 metres. The proposal would therefore not be within the tolerances of Schedule 2, Part 1, Class A, A.1 (i) and (ja) of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 as amended.\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposal, by reason of its extensive rearward projection, would be detrimental to the amenities of the neighbouring occupiers at no. 20 Boxtree Road contrary to Policy DM1 of the Development Management Policies Local Plan document (2013) and the relevant provisions of the adopted Harrow Supplementary Planning Document Residential Design Guide (2010)."
