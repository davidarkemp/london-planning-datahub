    "Reason : 1 - The proposed variation would introduce a new use class to the site, which was not considered as part of the original application, and would materially alter the intended uses allowed within the scope of the development description to the permission P/5362/18 dated 11.7.19. The application is therefore considered to be outside the scope of Section 73 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended).\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed variation, due to the nature of the proposed use along with the proposed opening hours would result in a detrimental impact to the residential amenities of neighbouring properties and future occupiers of the proposed development, due to noise and general disturbance. The proposed development is therefore contrary to The National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policies D3(7) and (9), D13(C) and (D), and D14 of The London Plan (2021), Policy AAP17.D(d) of the Harrow and Wealdstone Area Action Plan (2013), and policies DM1.C and DM41 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013).\r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed variation, due to the lack of floorplans and the proposed opening hours, and the failure to address the Secure by Design Certification required by Condition 7 of the permission P/5362/18 dated 11.7.19, has not been demonstrated to the satisfaction of The Local Planning Authority that the proposal has been designed to deter crime and ensure a safe and secure environment. The proposal is therefore contrary to the high-quality design aspirations of The National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policies D11.C and D3.D(5) of The London Plan (2021), Policy AAP4.A of the Harrow and Wealdstone Area Action Plan (2013) and policy DM1.A and DM1.B of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013).\r\n"
