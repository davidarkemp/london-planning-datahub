    "Reason : 1 - The proposed two storey front extension and associated crown roof, and the first floor and roof level rear extension; by reason of their combined bulk, massing, unsatisfactory design, and poor assimilation with the original roof form results in an unsympathetic, incongruous, bulky, unduly prominent, and contrived form of development that the fails to respect the character, composition and design of the host dwelling, and unduly detracts from visual amenity afforded along the street scene. The proposal would thereby be contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D3.D(1) and D3.D(11) of The  London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 B. (a) and (b) of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed first floor and roof level rear extension by reason of its excessive bulk, massing, rearward projection, height, and siting in relation to No. 31 and 35 High View would give rise to an unneighbourly, unduly dominant and overbearing form of development which would result in an unacceptable loss of outlook to the rear gardens of Nos. 31 and 35 High View. The proposed development would thereby be contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D3.D(7) of the London Plan (2021), Policy DM1 B. (a), DM1 D. (d) and (e) of the Development Management Policies Local Plan document (2013) and the relevant provisions of the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010)."
