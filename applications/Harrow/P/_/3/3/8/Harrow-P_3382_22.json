    "Reason : 1 - The proposal when considered with the existing extensions, by reason of its cumulative scale and poor design, would result in a development which is bulky, disproportionate in scale and unsympathetic to the original dwellinghouse, and would provide a poor quality of living environment to the existing and future occupiers of the dwelling. The proposal would therefore be contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D3 (D(1), D(7) and D(11)) of The London Plan (2021), policy CS.1 of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Guidance Residential Design Guide (2010).\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposal, by reason of its bulk, massing, and siting along the common boundaries, and the proposed window in the southern elevation, would result in a undue impacts on the neighbouring property 169 Headstone Lane, in terms of obtrusive visual impacts and heightened sense of enclosure on that neighbouring property, as well as real and/or perceived overlooking and loss of privacy, contrary to policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Guidance Residential Design Guide (2010).\r\n"
