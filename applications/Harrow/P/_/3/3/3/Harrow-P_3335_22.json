    "Reason : 1 - The proposed outbuilding by reason of its excessive scale, together with the absence of any justification for the necessity of the large scale of the outbuilding for the uses proposed, on the balance of probabilities would not be for purposes incidental to the enjoyment of the dwellinghouse as such. The proposal would therefore not be within the tolerances of Schedule 2, Part 1, Class E of The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development)(England) Order 2015 as amended.",
