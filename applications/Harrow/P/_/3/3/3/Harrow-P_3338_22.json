    "Reason : 1 - The proposed replacement dwellinghouse by reason of its uncharacteristic contemporary design, blocky form, unsympathetic and unduly bulky flat roof, its prominent three storey appearance, it's excessive incorporation of uninterrupted white render, its incongruous roof terrace, and its failure to adequately reflect distinctive design features of surrounding dwellinghouses along the road, would give rise to an incongruous, unsympathetic and contrived form of development that would appear unduly at odds with the established pattern of buildings along the street scene, adversely impacting upon the overall visual amenity afforded within the area. The proposal would thereby be contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies D3.D(1) and D3.D(11) of The London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 A, DM1 B (a), (b) and (c) of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed front access gates, associated brick wall and proposed flank boundary treatment (where applied to the front forecourt), by reason of their siting, uncharacteristic height, the resulting lack of visual permeability into and surrounding the site, and their undesirable visual demarcation of the site would appear unduly at odds the established pattern of front forecourt treatment along the street scene which is predominantly low scale and very open in nature. The proposal would thereby be contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies D3.D(1) and D3.D(11) of The London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 A, DM1 B (a), (b), (c) and (d) of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 3 - In failing to provide proposed elevation drawings detailing the external appearance of the proposed rear outbuilding, its height, and the extent to which the proposed solar panels would protrude above the roof surface, the Council cannot be satisfied that this building would not appear as an incongruous, disproportionate and unsympathetic addition to the application site and area in a wider context. Furthermore, the Council cannot be satisfied that this outbuilding would not appear as unduly overbearing and visually intrusive when viewed from the rear gardens of adjoining neighbouring properties at No. 51 and 55 Suffolk Road in addition to No. 94 Chester Drive. The proposal would thereby be contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies D3.D(1), D3.D(7), D3.D(11) of The London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 A, DM1 B (a), (b),and (c), DM1 C, DM1 D (d) and (e) of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010)."
