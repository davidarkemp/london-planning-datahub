    "Reason : 1 - The proposed single storey side to rear extension by reason of its excessive scale and depth, would give rise to a disproportionate, visually obtrusive, dominant and incongruous form of development that would not respect the scale of the host property or prevailing pattern of development and would be harmful to the character and appearance of the subject dwelling and the local area, contrary to the high quality design aspirations set out in the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policy D3.D (1) and (11) of The London Plan (2021), policy CS1.B on the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), policy DM1 of the Development Management Local Plans Policies (2013) and adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed single storey side and rear extension by reason of its excessive rearward projection and its siting along the shared boundaries would create an overbearing and visually prominent structure when viewed from the rear elevation and gardens of no.14 and No. 18 Langton Road and would result in a loss of light, loss of outlook and overshadowing to the detriment of the visual and residential amenities of the occupiers of the adjoining properties contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policy D3 D (7) of The London Plan (2012),  policy DM1 of the Development Management Local Plans Policies (2013) and adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010)."
