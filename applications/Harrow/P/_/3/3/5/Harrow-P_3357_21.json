    "Reason : 1 - The outbuilding, by reason of scale, setting and prominent siting, forward of the front building line and within the front garden area together with non-residential use of the building, would be harmful to the character and appearance of the existing building, the street scene and the wider residential and conservation area. Additionally, it would harm the character and setting of the host Grade II Listed Building and the neighbouring listed buildings contrary to the high-quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies D3.D(1), D3.D(11) and HC1 of the London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1 (B) of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), policies DM1, DM7 and DM46 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013), the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010) and the Roxborough Park and the Grove Conservation Area Appraisal and Management Strategy (2008).\r\n"
