    "Reason : 1 - The proposed side and rear dormer windows, by reason of the prominent siting and excessive depth of the side dormer window, and by reason of the rear dormers awkward and visually cluttered amalgamation where it would attach to the existing valley of the existing first floor rear extension, would form incongruous, discordant, and dominant additions to the subject dwelling and street scene. The proposal would thereby be contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies D3.D(1) and D3.D(11) of The London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 A., DM1 B. (a), (b) and (c) of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010)."
