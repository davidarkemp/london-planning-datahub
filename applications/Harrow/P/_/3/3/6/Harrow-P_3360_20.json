    "Reason : 1 - The proposed balcony, by reason of its sitting and orientation, would give rise to a loss of privacy for neighbouring occupiers, as well as actual and perceived overlooking to flank protected windows and the amenity areas of no. 6 Hall Farm Close, which would be harmful to the residential amenities of the occupiers of these neighbouring properties. The proposal is therefore contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), policies 7.4B and 7.6B of The London Plan (2016), Policies D1 and D3 of the Draft London Plan (2019), policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), policy DM1 of the Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010)."
