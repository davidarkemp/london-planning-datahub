    "Reason : 1 - The proposed variation of condition 2 to allow the change of use to part of the land within the application site to a shisha lounge  and dining area would fall outside the scope of the approved description of development under planning permission P/0148/18, dated 27/04/2018.  The proposal is therefore contrary to section 73 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990. ",
    "Reason : 2 - Notwithstanding the reason 1, the existing pergola, by reason of its siting, excessive bulk and scale, use of materials and design results in a visually dominant, contrived, unduly obtrusive and inappropriate form of development, which detracts from and is significantly harmful to the setting of the existing Grade II listed building,  to the detriment of the character and appearance of the surrounding area, the setting of the Grade II Listed building and the visual amenities of the neighbouring occupiers. In the absence of clear and convincing justification for the harm, or public benefits that outweigh the harm, the proposal is contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), policies 7.4B, 7.6B and 7.8 C and D of The London Plan (2016), London Plan 2019 - Intend to Publish Version (2019) policies D3 and HC1.C, policies CS1 B and D of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012) and policies DM 1 and DM 7 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) \r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - Notwithstanding reason 1, the existing pergola, by reason of its excessive size, proximity to neighbouring residential properties, its inappropriate use as a combined shisha lounge and dining area together with its intensity of use, would give rise to continued unreasonable detrimental impacts to the residential amenities of the neighbouring occupiers in the vicinity, due to unacceptable levels of noise, odour and disturbance associated with its use as a shisha lounge and dining area. The proposed development is therefore contrary to The National Planning Policy Framework (2019), policy 7.15 of The London Plan (2016), policies D3 and D13 of The London Plan 2019 - Intend to Publish Version (2019) and policy DM1 of Harrow's Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013)."
