    "Reason : 1 - The proposed two storey side extension, by reason of its siting and design would give rise to an inappropriate and incongruous form of development in the streetscene that would result in a loss of openness,an inappropriate terracing effect, and detract from the character, composition and design of the surrounding group of detached properties, would be to the detriment of the character and appearance of the host dwellinghouse, the streetscene, and the established and prevailing pattern of development in the locality contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D3.D(1) and D3.D(11) of The London Plan (2021), Policy CS.1B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 of the Development Management Plan Local Policies (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010)."
