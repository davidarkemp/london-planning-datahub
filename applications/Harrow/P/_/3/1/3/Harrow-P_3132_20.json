    "Reason : 1 - The existing single storey rear extension, by reason of its excessive height, poor roof design and non-matching materials, is an unduly bulky, unsympathetic and visually obtrusive form of development which is harmful to the character and appearance of the host dwelling and the area and is detrimental to the visual amenities of No. 27 Nelson Road. The development is therefore contrary to the high quality design aspirations referred to in the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), policies 7.4 B and 7.6 B of The London Plan (2016), policies D1 and D3 of the Draft London Plan (2019), policy CS1.B of The Harrow Core Strategy (2012), policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document Residential Design Guide (2010).\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - In the absence of an adequate Flood Risk Assessment with flood maps and flood mitigation measures, the proposal  has failed to demonstrate that it would be resilient and resistant to the risk of flooding within the site , to the detriment of the future users of the site, contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), policy 5.12B/C of The London Plan (2016), Policies SI12 of The London Plan (2019) - Intend to Publish, Core Policy CS1U of Harrow Core Strategy (2012) and policy DM9 of the Development Management Policies Development Plan Document (2013)."
