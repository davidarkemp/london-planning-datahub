    "Reason : 1 - Due to the height, depth, width and siting of the proposed fixed canopy structure at the front forecourt and the inclusion of external roller shutters the proposal would give rise to an incongruous and overbearing form of development which would be  harmful to the visual amenity of the streetscape.  This would harm the character and appearance of the subject building and the wider neighbourhood parade. The development therefore fails to meet the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), and is contrary to policy D3 of the London Plan (2021), Core Strategy Policy CS1.B (2012) and policies DM1 and DM4 of the Harrow Development Management Local Plan Policies (2013).",
    "Reason : 2 - Insufficient information has been provided for the Council to make a comprehensive assessment as to the likely impact on residential amenity, in terms of noise and disturbance, which would result from the likely intensification of use the canopy would permit and the extended opening hours. There is likely to be significant noise impacts on the immediately adjacent neighbours, in particular the units directly above the forecourt at Nos.102-108 Pinner Road and those immediately adjoining at Nos.100 and 110 Pinner Road. As such, the proposal fails to demonstrate that there would not be an adverse impact on the amenity of neighbours and would be in conflict with the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), Policies D13 and D14 of the London Plan (2021) and Policy DM1 of the Development Management Local Plan Policies  (2013)."
