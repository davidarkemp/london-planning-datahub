    "Reason : 1 - The proposed hip to gable and rear dormer extension to the existing dwellinghouse when considered in conjunction with the existing two-storey side extension by reason of its inappropriate roof design and cumulative bulk results in an unsympathetic, incongruous, bulky and contrived form of development that fails to respect the character, composition and design of the host dwelling and prevailing pattern of development in within the area. The proposal would thereby be contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D3 (D(1) and D(11)) of The  London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 A, DM1 B (a) and (b) of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010)."
