    "Reason : 1 - The proposed building, by reason of the incursion of its footprint on to existing garden land, is considered to constitute inappropriate development. As such, the principle of development is contrary to the Harrow Core Strategy of directing new residential and other development to the Harrow and Wealdstone Opportunity Area, town centres and, in suburban areas, to strategic previously developed sites, and would therefore harm its implementation, and would be contrary to the aims of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies D1.A (3), D3.D (1), and D3.D (11) of the London Plan (2021), Policies CS1.A and CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012) and the Adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Garden Land Development (2013).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed dwelling, by reason of its siting forward of the established front building line, and by reason of its excessive width, depth, height and poorly designed roof form, would result in an excessively bulky and dominant form of development which would fail to respond to the character of the area, and which would interrupt the existing prevailing pattern and grain of development within this part of the Charlton Road street scene. As such the proposal would fail to meet with the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies D1.A (3), D3.D (1), and D3.D (11) of the London Plan (2021), Policies CS1.A and CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 of the Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013), and the Adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010). \r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed development, by reason of its depth, height, proximity to side shared boundaries, and the position of ground and first floor windows, would create an overbearing impact for neighbours at No 3A Charlton Road and Pandora Court, and would create an unacceptable loss of privacy and overlooking for both these neighbours, contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies D6.B and D6.D of The London Plan (2021), Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013), and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 4 - The proposal, by reason of inadequate floor to ceiling heights for Flats 1 � 7, shortfalls in gross internal floor area to Flats No. 2 , 3 and 4, inadequate bedroom sizes within Flats No 4 and 7, and a number of poor stacking relationships, would result in a substandard and cramped form of living accommodation to the detriment of the future occupiers, contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies D6.A, D6.B, D6D, and D6F (1), D6.F (4), and D6.F (8) of The London Plan (2021), Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013), the Mayor of London�s Housing Supplementary Planning Guidance (2016) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 5 - The proposal, by reason of the number of units, insufficient and in practical access to storage space for refuse and recycling, and by reason of the proposed siting and scale of bicycle storage, would lead to an over intensive redevelopment of the site and an in practical, cramped and poorly designed external amenity  area, detrimental to the living conditions of future occupiers, and failing to adhere to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies D3.D (1), D3.D (8), D3.D (10), and D6E of The London Plan (2021), Core Policies CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policies DM1 and DM45 of the Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013), and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 6 - The proposal, in the absence of a sufficient Fire Statement demonstrating how the safety of building users would be met and how the proposed building would achieve the highest standards of fire safety, would be contrary to Policy D12 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "Reason : 7 - The proposal, by reason of insufficient information, has failed to demonstrate that it would be located within the community which it intends to serve and would not direct community, cultural and leisure facilities to Harrow�s Town Centres. The Council is therefore unable to accurately assess the principle of the proposed uses at ground floor, and the proposal is in conflict with Policies CS1.L of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), and Policy DM46.B a), b), and c) of the Harrow Development Management Policies Plan (2013).",
    "Reason : 8 - The proposal, by reason of insufficient information, fails to demonstrate that it would not prejudice highway safety and would not harm safe traffic flow or the amenity of neighbouring occupiers, and contribute to sustainable travel modes. The Council is therefore unable to accurately assess the cycling and parking requirements and the proposal is therefore in conflict with Policies T5 and T6 of The London Plan (2021), and Policies DM1, DM42.A.a), DM42.F, and DM44.C of the Harrow Development Management Policies Plan (2013).\r\n"
