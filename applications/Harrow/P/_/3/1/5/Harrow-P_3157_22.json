    "Reason : 1 - The proposed single storey rear extension due to its excessive depth, height and unsympathetic roof design when considered cumulatively with the existing front to side extension would not relate well or harmonise with the design and appearance of the host dwelling. The proposal would result in an unsympathetic form of development which is bulky and unduly obtrusive to the detriment of the character and appearance of the host dwelling and the South Hill Avenue Conservation Area, contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policies D3 (D(1) and D(11)) and HC1 of The London Plan (2021), policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), policies DM1 and DM7 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013), the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010) and the South Hill Avenue Conservation Area Management Strategy (2008). \r\n",
