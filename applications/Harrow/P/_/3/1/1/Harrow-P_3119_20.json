    "Reason : 1 - The outbuilding, by reason of its gabled roof design, height, excessive bulk and siting, would result in an unduly prominent and obtrusive form of development, which would fail to respect the context, scale and setting of the dwellinghouse and the pattern of development in the area, to the detriment of the character and appearance of the area and the visual and residential amenities of the occupiers of the neighbouring properties, contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), policies 7.4B and 7.6B of The London Plan (2016), Policies D1 and D4 of the Draft London Plan ï¿½ Intend to Publish, Core Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 of the Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013)  and the Adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).
