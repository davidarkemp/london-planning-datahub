    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development, due to its excessive height and depth, the enclosure of the original ground floor rear bay window, the in-filling of the gap to the boundary with 99 Moss Lane, and the interruption too the unity of the group of houses nos. 97 to 103 Moss Lane, would result in a bulky, obtrusive and unsympathetic cumulative extensions which would be detrimental to the character and appearance of the property and the conservation area. The proposed development is therefore contrary to The National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policies D3.D(1) and (11) and HC1. C of The London Plan (2021), Policy CS1.B/D of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), policies DM1.A of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan 2013, the adopted Residential Design Guide Supplementary Planning Document (2010), and the Moss Lane Conservation Area Appraisal and Management Strategy (2009).\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposal, due to the excessive depth and height of the single storey rear extension, and the proposal's siting on a raised patio, would result in undue impacts on 95 Moss Lane in terms of overshadowing, enclosure and visual impacts; while the proposal's siting on a raised patio would result in undue impacts on 99 Moss Lane in terms of visual impacts, to the detriment of the residential amenities of neighbouring properties. The proposed development is therefore contrary to The National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policy DM1.C and DM1.D of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Residential Design Guide Supplementary Planning Document (2010).\r\n"
