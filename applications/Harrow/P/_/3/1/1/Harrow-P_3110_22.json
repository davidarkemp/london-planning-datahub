    "Reason : 1 - The proposed two storey front and side extensions in conjunction with the gable roof design and increase in roof height, by reason of their excessive bulk, size and scale, and unsatisfactory design, would give rise to an inappropriate, visually dominant and obtrusive form of development, which would subsume the existing dwellings and be at odds with the predominant pattern of development on the southern side of Bransgrove Road, to the detriment of the character and appearance of the existing and adjacent dwellings and this part of the streetscene, contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policy D3.D(11) of the London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012),Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and guidance contained in the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010)",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed first floor rear extensions by reason of their siting, excessive depth and relationship with the adjacent property at no. 70 Bransgrove Road  would result in a harmful impact on the amenities of this property in terms of loss of outlook, daylight and an increased sense of enclosure, contrary to Policy D3.D(7) of the London Plan (2021), Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and guidance contained in the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010)."
