    "Reason : 1 - The proposed two storey front extension, by reason of its excessive crown roof depth, projection from the front wall of the original house, adjoining tiled roof feature between the front extension and the existing pitched roof front addition, and its overall poor design, would fail to provide proportionate, subordinate and harmonious addition to the host dwellinghouse to the detriment of the scale, character and appearance of the existing dwellinghouse and the adjacent dwellings, and the prevailing pattern of development in the locality, contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D3 D (1) and (11) of The  London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed rear dormer extension by reason of its overall scale, bulky design, siting, excessive width and crown roof depth, would introduce an overly dominant, obtrusive and incongruous form of development that subsumes the rear elevation of the host dwellinghouse and fails to respect the scale, character and appearance of the surrounding properties. The development is therefore detrimental to the character and appearance of the existing dwellinghouse and the adjacent dwellings, and the established and prevailing pattern of development in the locality contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D3 (D(1) and (11)) of The  London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010)\r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed roof terrace and associated balustrades, by reason of its excessive height, design and siting would  fail to respect the scale, character and appearance of the dwelling house and surrounding properties. The development is therefore detrimental to the character and appearance of the existing dwellinghouse and the adjacent dwellings, and the established and prevailing pattern of development in the locality contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D3.D (1) and (11) of The  London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 4 - The proposed car parking spaces adjacent to the trees within the front area of the property, by reason of their siting and associated groundwork, would result in a potential detrimental impact on the root protection zones of these two trees. As such, the proposal would be contrary to policy G7 of the London Plan (2021) and Policy DM22 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013)."
