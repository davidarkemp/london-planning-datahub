    "Reason : 1 - The proposed part single part two storey rear extension and associated roof form by reason its excessive combined depth, height, width, bulk, massing footprint, lack of subservience with the main dwelling and unduly expansive crown roof would represent an incongruous, unsympathetic insubordinate, contrived and disproportionate addition to the host dwelling, that would excessively detract from its original form and appearance, and the character and appearance of the area in a wider sense. The proposal would thereby be contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D3 (D(1) and D(11)) of The  London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 A. and DM1 B. (a) of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed part single part two storey rear extension and associated roof form by reason its excessive combined depth, height, width, bulk, massing footprint, and siting in relation to No. 9 Thornton Grove would give rise to an unneighbourly, unduly dominant and overbearing form of development which would result in an unacceptable loss of outlook to the rear garden of No. 9 Thornton Grove. The proposed development would thereby be contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D3(7)  of the London Plan (2021), Policy DM1 B. (a), DM1 C., and DM1 D. (e) of the Development Management Policies Local Plan document (2013) and the relevant provisions of the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010)."
