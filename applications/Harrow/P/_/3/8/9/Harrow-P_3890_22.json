    "Reason : 1 - The  first floor rear extension, by reason of its poor and incompatible flat roof design in conjunction with the existing hip-to-gable end enlargement and rear dormer would introduce bulky, incongruous and disproportionate additions resulting in a poor incohesive design that would serve to subsume the rear elevation of the existing dwellinghouse and appear out of scale, character and appearance with the neighbouring properties, the development is therefore detrimental to the character and appearance of the existing dwellinghouse and the wider area, contrary to The National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D3.D(1) of The London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document Residential Design Guide (2010).\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed single storey rear extension, by reason of its siting and excessive rearward projection, would be unduly obtrusive and would result in a loss of outlook, to the  detriment  of the visual and residential amenities of the occupiers of the adjacent property No.94 Cavendish Avenue, contrary to Policy D3 (7) of The London Plan (2021), Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and guidance contained in the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010)."
