    "Reason : 1 - The proposed first floor side and rear extension, in conjunction with the existing end gable and large rear dormer roof extensions to the property, would result in discordant and ungainly cumulative additions to the dwelling, to the detriment of  the character and appearance of the host dwelling and the local area, contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policy D3.D (1) and (11) of the London Plan (2021), policy CS1.B of the Core Strategy (2012), policy DM1 of the Development Management Policies (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed first floor side and rear extension, by reason of its siting, scale, gable ended roof form and proximity to the side boundary, would appear highly intrusive and overbearing, and would significantly increase the loss of outlook and enclosure when viewed from the north-west facing first floor bedroom window, to the detriment of the residential and visual amenities of the occupiers of the neighbouring property at No. 33 Whitchurch Gardens. As such, the proposed development would be contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D3.D (7) and (11) of the London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and guidance contained in the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010)"
