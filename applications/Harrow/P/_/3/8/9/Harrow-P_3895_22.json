    "Reason : 1 - The existing outbuilding and chimney, in conjunction with the existing single storey rear extensions to the property, by reason of its excessive site coverage and overall height, has resulted in a bulky, unduly obtrusive, and incongruous building and an overdevelopment of the site to the detriment of the character and appearance of the existing property, the surrounding locality and the visual amenities of the adjoining occupiers, contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D3 D.1, D.7 and D.11 of The  London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 2 - The existing outbuilding and chimney, by reason of its siting in the rear garden and the production of smoke/ fumes from the chimney, is an unneighbourly form of development and is harmful to the residential and visual amenities of the occupiers of the adjoining neighbours, contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D3 D.7 of The  London Plan (2021), policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010)."
