    "Reason : 1 - The enlarged part of the dwellinghouse would attach to the existing two storey side extension and would constitute a single development. As a result, the extension would extend beyond an original side wall of the dwellinghouse and would have a width greater than half the width of the original dwellinghouse and exceed 4 metres in height The proposal would therefore not be within the tolerances of Schedule 2, Part 1, Class A, A.1 (g) (i), (j) (i)  (iii) and (ja) of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 as amended.\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposal, by reason of its rearward projection and siting, would be detrimental to the amenities of the neighbouring occupiers at No. 27 Snaresbrook Drive, contrary to Policy DM1 of the Development Management Policies Local Plan document (2013) and the relevant provisions of the adopted Harrow Supplementary Planning Document Residential Design Guide (2010).",
