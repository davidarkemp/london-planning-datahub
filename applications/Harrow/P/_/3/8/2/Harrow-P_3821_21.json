    "Reason : 1 - The proposal would result in the loss of residential floorspace for which there is a need to retain in the Borough. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy H8 of the London Plan (2021), Policy DM46 of Harrow Council Development Management Policies (2013).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposal, by reason of the nature of the use would result in unacceptable levels of general disturbance, to the detriment of the residential amenity of the adjoining occupiers. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy D14 of the London Plan (2021) and Policy DM 1 of the Development Management Policies (2013).",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed residential unit, by reason of its insufficient gross internal area, would result in poor, cramped and substandard quality of living accommodation to the detriment of the residential amenities of the future occupiers, contrary to Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021), Policy DM 1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013), the Technical Housing Standards - Nationally Described Space Standard (2015), Mayor Of London, Housing Supplementary Planning Guidance (2016) and adopted Supplementary Planning Document - Residential Design Guide (2010)."
