    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development by reason of its detailed design, scale, proportions and siting appears contrived, bulky, incongruous, cramped, and out of keeping with the character of the host building and wider terrace and the wider pattern of development to the detriment of the character and appearance of the streetscene and surrounding area. Furthermore, the development would harm the historic fabric, character, appearance and special interest of the Locally Listed host building and wider terrace (Nos.361-369). The proposal would therefore be contrary to the high-quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies D3.D(1), D3.D(11) and HC1 of The London Plan (2021), Policy CS.1B and CS1.D of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policies APP1, APP2 and AAP4 of the Harrow and Wealdstone Area Action Plan (2013), Policies DM1 and DM7 of the Development Management Plan Local Policies (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposal, by reason of cumulative impact of insufficient gross internal floor area (GIA), undersized bedrooms, poor quality outlook and lack of light and ventilation to bedrooms, lack of privacy, lack of defensible space in front of bedroom windows and no provision of external private amenity space, would create a cramped and poor standard of living accommodation for future occupiers to the detriment of their residential amenity. Additionally, the proposed rear extension, by reason of siting, excessive depth and scale would have an unacceptable impact on the residential amenities in terms of outlook and sense of enclosure of the neighbouring property at No.365 and potential impact on No.369 Station Road. The proposal would therefore be contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D3.D(7) and D6 of The London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1 (B) and CS1 (K) of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), policies DM1 and DM26 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed development fails to provide appropriate covered and secure cycle parking and waste storage, and has not identified sufficient space within the site where such provision could be made. The development is therefore contrary to the high-quality design aspirations of The National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policies T5 and D6.E of The London Plan (2021), policies CS1.B, CS1.R and CS1.X of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy AAP19 of the Harrow and Wealdstone Area Action Plan (2013) and policies DM1, DM42 and DM45 The Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013)."
