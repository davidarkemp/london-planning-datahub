    "Reason : 1 - The proposed first floor extension, would by reason of its awkward chamfered design; relate poorly to the built form and roof profile of the main dwellinghouse, forming an incongruous and unsympathetic addition to the host dwelling and area in wider context. The proposal would therefore by contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D3 D(1) and D3 D(11) of The London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1 (B) of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 B (b) and (c)  Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010)."
