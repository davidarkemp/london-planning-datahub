    "Reason : 1 -  The proposed development, by reason of an additional front door to the front elevation of the proposed side extension would fail to provide a coherent pattern of development in the street scene which would harm the form and relationship with the properties in the locality to the detriment of the character and appearance of the host building and the pattern of development within the surrounding streetscene and would therefore be contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies D3.D(1) and D3.D(11) of The London Plan (2021), Policy CS.1B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 of the Development Management Plan Local Policies (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 2 - The  first floor side to rear extension, by reason of its poor and incompatible roof form and its relation to the host dwelling as the continuation of the roof over the side and the set back from the catslide wall and the lack of a set down from the main ridge would lead to an incongruous design that would detract from the  existing dwellinghouse and appear out of scale, character and appearance with the neighbouring properties, the development is therefore detrimental to the character and appearance of the existing dwellinghouse and the wider area, contrary to The National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D3.D(1) and D3.D(11) of The London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed development by reason of its siting in the Harrow Strategic Flood Risk Assessment Zone 3A and in the absence of an adequate Flood Risk Assessment in relation to compensatory Flood Storage, flood zone extent and depth category, area / data, mitigation measures, and Drainage Details would likely to result in the displacement of water onto adjacent land and fail to provide resilience to flooding, to the detriment of the safety of existing and future occupiers of the application site.  The proposal has therefore failed to demonstrate compliance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy SI 13 of The London Plan (2021), policy CS1.U of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012) and policies DM9 and DM10 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013)."
