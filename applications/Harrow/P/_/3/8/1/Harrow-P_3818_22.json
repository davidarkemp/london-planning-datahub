    "Reason : 1 - The proposal would result in the additional dwellinghouse being sited on garden land. As such, the principle of the development is contrary to the Harrow Core Strategy of directing new residential and other development to the Harrow and Wealdstone Opportunity Area, town centres and, in suburban areas, to strategic previously developed sites and would therefore harm its implementation, contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies CS1.A and CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Garden Land Development (2013).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed new dwelling, by reason of its detailed design, scale, proportions and siting appears contrived, cramped and out of keeping with the existing dwellinghouse (No.240) and the wider pattern of development to the detriment of the character and appearance of the streetscene, and the pattern of development within the surrounding area. The proposal would therefore be contrary to the high-quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies D3.D(1) and D3.D(11) of The London Plan (2021), Policy CS.1B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 of the Development Management Plan Local Policies (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposal, by reason of insufficient gross internal floor area (GIA), undersized bedroom, insufficient floor to ceiling height and layout of the external amenity space would create a cramped and poor standard of living accommodation for future occupiers to the detriment of their residential amenity. Additionally, by reason of its positioning, location of windows and subdivision of garden space, the development would result in adverse overlooking and impact on outlook from neighbouring properties, an unacceptable reduction in private amenity space relating to No.240 Pinner Road and an overbearing visual impact on the garden of No.242 Pinner Road caused by a two-storey sheer wall built to the boundary contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D6 (D7) of The London Plan (2021), Policy CS1 K of the Harrow Core Strategy (2013), policies DM1 and DM26 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide Supplementary Planning Document (2010)"
