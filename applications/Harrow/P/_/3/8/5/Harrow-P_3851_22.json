  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed first floor side to rear extension together with the proposed side dormer roof extension, by reason of their excessive combined width, depth, lack of separation from the side boundary and prominent corner site positioning, would result in a visually cluttered amalgamation which would form an incongruous, discordant, contrived, unduly bulky and dominant addition, detracting from the character and appearance of the host building. The proposal would thereby be contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies D3.D(1) and D3.D(11) of The London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 A., DM1 B. (a), (b) and (c) of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 2 - The resultant floor area for the ground floor flat would fall below the minimum space standards (notwithstanding the annotation) required for a 3 bedroom (5 persons) unit and as such would give rise to a sub-standard and cramped living environment for the future occupiers of this flat. In addition to this, due vertical stacking arrangement between the two flats and in the absence of any mitigation would give rise to unacceptable noise transference between the proposed units. The proposed development would therefore give rise to substandard and poor quality accommodation to the detriment of the residential amenities of the future occupiers of the units contrary to policies D3 D (7) and  D6 of The London Plan (2021), policies DM1 and DM26 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013), the Mayor of London Housing Supplementary Planning Guidance (2016), Department for Communities and Local Government Technical Housing Standards - Nationally Described Space Standards (2015), and the adopted Supplementary Planning Documents Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 3 - The access to the rear garden for the first floor unit through the side path belonging to Park Lodge and the actual amount of amenity space provided for each unit is poor and unacceptable for the size of dwelling proposed given the available garden space. The proposed development would therefore give rise to substandard and poor quality accommodation to the detriment of the residential amenities of the future occupiers of the units contrary to policies D3 D (7) and D6 of The London Plan (2021), policies DM1, DM26 and DM27 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Documents Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 4 - The proposal does not include the extension for the existing vehicle crossover and the car parking 1 would not be accessible in a safe manor from the main distributor road and could potentially impact upon the free flow of highway traffic. Therefore insufficient information has been provided to demonstrate satisfactory mitigation measures that the proposed development will not adversely impact the safety on the local transport network, the proposal has therefore failed to demonstrate compliance with policy DM42 (E and F) of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013)."
