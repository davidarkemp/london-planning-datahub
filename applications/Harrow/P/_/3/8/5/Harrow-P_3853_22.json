    "Reason : 1 - The proposed first floor rear extension by reason of its excessive width, would give rise to a dominant and obtrusive form of development, which would subsume the original dwellinghouse and fail to respect its proportions, scale, built form and character. The proposal is therefore contrary to the high quality design aspirations set out in the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D3 (D(1) and D(11)) of The London Plan (2021), policy CS1.B on the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 of the Development Management Local Plans Policies (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).\r\n\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed first floor rear extension, by reason of its rearward projection, excessive width and siting in close proximity to No. 46 Tenby Road, would result in loss of light and outlook, and give rise to an overshadowing and overbearing visual impact to the detriment of the residential and visual amenities of the occupiers of this neighbouring property, contrary to the requirements of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D3 (D(7) of The London Plan (2021), Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).\r\n"
