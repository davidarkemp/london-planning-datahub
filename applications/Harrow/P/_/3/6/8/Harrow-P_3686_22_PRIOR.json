    "Reason : 1 - The proposed rear extension is attached to the existing 3.9 metre deep single storey rear extension and would therefore cumulatively extend beyond the rear wall of the original dwellinghouse by more than 6 metres and so would not be within the tolerances of A.1(g)(i) to Class A of Part 1 (of Schedule 2) of The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015, as amended.",
    "Reason : 2 - Notwithstanding the first reason for refusal, the depth and maximum height of the proposed extension has been misrepresented on the submitted application form. As such, the proposal does not comply with Conditions A.4(2)(a)(i) and (ii) of Part 1 (of Schedule 2) of The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015, as amended."
