    "Reason : 1 - The proposed single storey rear extension, by reason of its rearward projection, excessive height and siting, would be detrimental to the amenities of the neighbouring occupiers at 14 Thistlecroft Gardens contrary to Policy DM1 of the Development Management Policies Local Plan document (2013) and the relevant provisions of the adopted Harrow Supplementary Planning Document Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed single storey rear extension would be situated on a raised platform and would be situated within two metres of the boundary of the curtilage of the property and the eaves height would exceed 3 metres and it has not been demonstrated that the maximum height would not exceed 4 metres. The proposal would therefore not be within the tolerances of Schedule 2, Part 1, Class A, A.1 (i) and (f) (ii) of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 as amended."
