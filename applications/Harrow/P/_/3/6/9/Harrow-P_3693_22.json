    "Reason : 1 - The proposal would result in the development being sited on garden land and would exceed the footprint of what is considered to be appropriate enlargements. As such, the principle of the development is contrary to the Harrow Core Strategy of directing new residential and other development to the Harrow and Wealdstone Opportunity Area, town centres and, in suburban areas, to strategic previously developed sites and would therefore harm its implementation, contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies CS1.A and CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Garden Land Development (2013).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposal, by reason of its overall massing, siting, bulk and scale would result in the loss of important grass verge adjacent to Alexandra Avenue and would be an unduly bulky, incongruous and out of scale development which is incongruous in massing, at odds with the character of the area and the prevailing pattern of development in the streetscene on the southern side of Eastcote Lane. Furthermore, the development would break the visual alignment and verdant character of prominent grass verges running the length of Alexandra Avenue and would therefore be harmful to the character and appearance of the locality and the visual amenity of neighbours, contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies D3.D(1), D3.D(7) and D3.D(11) of The London Plan (2021), policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), policies DM1 and DM23 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 3 - The applicant as failed to provide any information relating to the protection of street trees or retention of Category B level trees. In the absence of sufficient justification, the applicant has failed to demonstrate there would be an acceptable impact on existing trees on the site and on large mature street trees lining Alexandra Avenue and the development is therefore contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policies DM1 DM22 and DM23 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013).",
    "Reason : 4 - The proposal, by reason of excessive bulk, scale, massing, overbearing impact and the potential for overlooking or perception of overlooking, would have an have an unacceptable impact on the residential amenities in terms of outlook, sense of enclosure and overbearing impact on the neighbouring property at No.149 Eastcote Lane, contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D3.D(7) of The London Plan (2021), Policy CS1 B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2013), policies DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013), the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide Supplementary Planning Document (2010)."
