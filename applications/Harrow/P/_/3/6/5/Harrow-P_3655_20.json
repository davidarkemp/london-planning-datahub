    "Reason : 1 - The extractor flues by reason of their size and unacceptable location gives rise to a form of development which is obtrusive and incongruous in appearance and overly dominant when viewed from the neighbouring residential properties to the detriment of the character and appearance of the existing building and the visual amenities of the area, contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D3 (D(1) and D(11)) of The London Plan (2021), policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012) and policy DM1 of the Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013).\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - Insufficient information has been submitted  to assess the impact of the extractor flu on neighbouring properties. Due to the location of the equipment in relation to nos. 150A, 152A and 154 Pinner Road, in particular, the retention of the equipment would potentially lead to an increase in noise, odour and disturbance to the detriment of the amenities of upper floor flats, contrary to Policies D3 (D(9)) and D14 of The London Plan 2021 and Policy DM1 of the Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013).\r\n"
