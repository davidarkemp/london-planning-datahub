    "Reason : 1 - The proposal, by reason of its scale, bulk, and design, would constitute an unsympathetic and incongruous form of development in a visually prominent location that would fail to integrate successfully with the host property. Furthermore, the proposed extension would relate poorly to, and cause harm to, the local spatial character of the location. The development therefore fails to comply with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), policy DM1 of the Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010)."
