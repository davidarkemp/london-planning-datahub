    "Reason : 1 - The proposed first floor side to rear extension, by reason of  its cumulative poor design and roof form, and the excessive width and depth of the first floor rear extension, would fail to provide a proportionate, balanced, subordinate and harmonious addition to the host dwellinghouse, and would result in an overly dominant, obtrusive, contrived and incongruous form of development that would subsume the rear elevation of the host property, and would fail to respect the character and appearance of the host dwellinghouse, neighbouring properties and the prevailing pattern of development in the locality, contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies D3.D(1) and (11) of The London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1 (B) of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), policy DM 1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013), the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010)."
