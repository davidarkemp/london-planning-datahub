    "Reason : 1 - The proposed amendments would materially alter the appearance of the approved development and would result in a significant impact on the overall design, character and appearance of the host building. The proposal would therefore need to be re-assessed against the requirements of Policy D3 of The London Plan (2021), Policy DM1 of the Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010). The proposal is therefore not considered to be non-material minor amendment."
