    "Reason : 1 - The proposed extensions and alterations to the building by reason of their excessive volume, floor space, and footprint, would result in disproportionate additions over and above the size of the original building and would therefore constitute an inappropriate development within the Green Belt, to the detriment of the character and openness of the Green Belt contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy G2 of The London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1.F of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM16 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013), and no very special circumstances have been demonstrated by the applicant whereby the harm to the Green Belt by reason of inappropriateness or otherwise is outweighed by other considerations.",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed development by reason of its fenestration, cumulative width, bulk, scale, massing and inappropriate set-backs from the front wall of the main dwellinghouse, would fail to provide subordinate and harmonious additions to the host dwellinghouse, which would result in an overly dominant, obtrusive and incongruous form of development that serves to erode and subsume the character of the dwellinghouse, and the neighbouring properties, contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D3.D(1) and (11) of the London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed single storey rear extension by reason of its excessive rearward projection, excessive height and its siting immediately adjacent to the northern shared boundary, would create an overbearing and visually prominent structure when viewed from the rear elevation and garden of Wykeham, Brookshill which would result in a loss of light and loss of outlook to the detriment of the visual and residential amenities of the occupiers of the adjoining property contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D3.D(7) of The London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).\r\n"
