    "Reason : 1 - Part of the dwellinghouse would, as a result of the works, extend beyond the plane of an existing roof slope which forms the principal elevation of the dwellinghouse and fronts a highway. The proposal would therefore not be within the tolerances of Schedule 2, Part 1, Class B, B.1(c) of The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development)(England) Order 2015 as amended.",
    "Reason : 2 - It has not been demonstrated that the edge of the proposed dormer closest to the eaves of the original roof would not be less than 0.2 metres from the eaves, measured along the roof slope from the outside edge of the eaves. The proposed development would not therefore be within the tolerances of Schedule 2, Part 1, Class B, Conditions B.2 (b) (bb), of The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 as amended.",
