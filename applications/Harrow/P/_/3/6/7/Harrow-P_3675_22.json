    "Reason : 1 - The proposed first floor rear extension by reason of its width, depth and bulk and the proposed rear dormer by reason of its cramped siting within the rear roofslope, would result in excessive and overly dominant extensions which would fail to respect the proportions and scale of the original building and the prevailing pattern of development in the area, contrary to the high quality design aspirations set out in the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policies D3.D(1) and D3.D(11) of The London Plan (2021), policy CS1.B on the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), policy DM1 of the Development Management Local Plans Policies (2013) and adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed first floor rear extension, by reason of its excessive rearward projection, and siting in relation to No 177 Uxbridge Road, would result in an unacceptable loss of outlook, loss of sunlight and overshadowing, to the detriment of the residential and visual amenities of the neighbouring occupiers at 177 Uxbridge Road, contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D3 (7) of The London Plan (2021), Policy DM1 of the Development Management Policies Local Plan document (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010)."
