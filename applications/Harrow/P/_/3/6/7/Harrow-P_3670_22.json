    "Reason : 1 - The Asbestos Register Report carried out in support of Condition 1 is inadequate. Therefore, insufficient information has been submitted with regards to analysis and inspection of all areas and structures likely to be affected during construction. The applicant has therefore failed to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority that the approved development would not activate to spread any potential contaminants on the site and that the land would be appropriately remediated. The proposal is therefore contrary to the high quality design aspirations of The National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policy DM15.A and B of the Harrow Development Management Polices Local Plan (2013)."
