    "Reason : 1 - The proposed rear extensions and rear dormer by reason of its excessive scale and insufficient set backs, would give rise to an unsympathetic, incongruous, bulky, obtrusive form of development which would fail to respect the character, composition and design of the host and neighbouring properties and would significantly detract from the established and prevailing pattern of development in the area, to the detriment of the character and appearance of the host building and those surrounding. The proposal is therefore contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies D1 and D3 of the London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed single storey rear extensions, by reason of its excessive rearward projection, and siting in relation to the shared boundaries, would result in an unacceptable loss of outlook, loss of sunlight and overshadowing, to the detriment of the residential and visual amenities of the neighbouring occupiers at No.75 and 79 Graham Road, contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D3 of The London Plan (2021), Policy DM1 of the Development Management Policies Local Plan document (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010)."
