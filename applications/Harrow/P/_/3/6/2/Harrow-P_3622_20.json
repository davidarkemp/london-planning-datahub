    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development results in a physical separation of the forecourt from the public footpath and erodes the open character of this section of High Road and is an imposing and incongruous feature within the streetscene that does not reflect the pattern of development in the area. The loss of the pre-existing soft landscaping also has had a detrimental impact on the host property and the wider streetscene. The proposal is considered to harm the character and appearance of the host property and is an incongruous feature in the streetscene. The proposal therefore fails to comply with the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), policies 7.4B and 7.6B of The London Plan (2016), Policy D3 of The Publication London Plan (2020), Core Policy CS1B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), policy DM1 Harrow Development Management Plan Local Policies (2013) and Harrow's adopted SPD - Residential Design Guide (2010)."
