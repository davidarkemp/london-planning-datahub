    "Reason : 1 - The proposed new dwelling, by reason its failure to incorporate an improved design in relation to the characterful arts and craft style building which it is to replace, its uncharacteristic contemporary design, its failure to reflect distinctive design features of the existing building and surrounding buildings, its incongruous and cluttered proliferation of roof lights,  and finally its use of unsympathetic contemporary fenestration and uncharacteristic first floor inset terraces would form an incongruous, unsympathetic and contrived form or development which would fail to be in keeping with the prevailing pattern of buildings within the Pinner Hill Estate Conservation Area and the Area of Special Character within which the application site is located. The proposal would thereby be contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies D3 D(1), D3 D(11) and Policy HC1 C of the London Plan (2021), Core Policies CS1.B, CS1.D, and CS6.A of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policies DM1 A, DM1 B (a), (b), (c), DM6 A (a), (b), DM6 C, DM7 A, DM7 B (a), (b), and DM7 D  of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013), the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010) and the Pinner Hill Conservation Area Appraisal and Management Strategy (2009).",
    "Reason : 2 - By reason of the fact that the site is located adjacent to a Site of Importance for Nature Conservation (SINC) and insufficient information has been provided  in relation to bat mitigation measures, Biodiversity Net Gain proposals, proposals for ecological enhancement for bats, birds and invertebrates within the fabric of the new building, and with the proposal having an insufficient gain in terms of biodiversity units, the applicant has failed to demonstrate that the proposed development would have an acceptable impact upon local biodiversity and ecology. The proposal would thereby be contrary to the to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy G6 A, G6 C, and G6 D of the London Plan (2021), Policies DM20 A, DM20 B, and DM21 A (e) of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013), in addition to the Harrow Biodiversity Action Plan 2015 - 2020."
