    "Reason : 1 - The proposed enlargement of the rear garage by reason of by reason of depth, width, site coverage and inappropriate form and design, would result in obtrusive, disproportionate and unsympathetic extension to the garage and dwellinghouse, and would be at odds with the pattern of development in the surrounding area. It would therefore be harmful to the character and appearance of the host dwelling and the wider West Towers Conservation Area, contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021),  Policies D3(D(1) and D(11)) and HC1 of The London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1 (B) of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policies DM1, and DM7 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010)."
