    "Reason : 1 - The proposed extension's eaves indicated on the submitted application form are inaccurate. The eaves height specified on the application form has not been correctly measured from the ground level at the base of the outside wall to the point where that wall would meet the upper surface of the flat roof. In light of the above, the Council are not satisfied that the applicant has provided an accurate written description of the extension's eaves heights. The development would thereby be contrary to condition A.4(2) (a) (iii) and A.4 (3) permitted by Class A of Part 1 (to Schedule 2) of The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015."
