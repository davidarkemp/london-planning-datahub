    "Reason : 1 - The existing brick piers, and the proposed gates, by reason of their height, form and siting, are inappropriate development within the Green Belt for which no case for very special circumstances has been demonstrated which would outweigh the harm caused by reason of inappropriateness. The proposal is therefore contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy G2 of the London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1.F of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012) and Policy DM16 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013).",
    "Reason : 2 - The existing brick piers and proposed gates, by reason of their form, height and siting, are considered to  give rise to an unsympathetic and incongruous form of development which is harmful to the open and rural character of the area, and to the openness and visual amenities of the Green Belt, contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policies D4 and G2 of the London Plan (2021), policy CS1.B and CS1.F of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012) and policies DM1 and DM16 of the Development Management Policies Local Plan 2013."
