    "Reason : 1 - The proposal, by reason of the overall footprint and siting on a private residential garden, would result in an inappropriate form of development at odds with the spatial strategy for the Borough of directing new residential and other development to the Harrow and Wealdstone Opportunity Area, town centres and, in suburban areas, to strategic previously developed sites and would therefore harm its implementation and the contribution that gardens make to the character of the area contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021),  Policies CS1.A and CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document Garden Land Development (2013).\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed development by reason of its backland siting, scale and cramped layout  would represent an inappropriate form of development  which would be detrimental to the character and the pattern of development in the locality, contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021),  Policy D3 (D(1)  and D(11)) of The London Plan (2021),  Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013), the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).\r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed building by reason of its excessive height in close proximity to the boundaries with No. 46 Harrow View and 2b Balfour Road, would lead to an overbearing impact on the occupiers of these neighbouring properties  to the detriment of their residential and visual amenities, contrary to policy D3 (7) of The London Plan (2021), policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010). \r\n",
    "Reason : 4 - The proposed dwelling would not be provided with any private outdoor space and would therefore provide a poor standard of accommodation for future occupiers. The proposed development is therefore contrary to the high quality design aspirations of The National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policy D6(9) of The London Plan (2021), policy DM1.B(d), DM1.C and policy DM1.D(i) of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).\r\n",
    "Reason : 5 - The proposed ground floor flat, due to its lack of defensible space would result in unacceptable privacy for the future occupiers which would provide a unsatisfactory standard of residential accommodation for future occupiers. The proposed development is therefore contrary to the high quality design aspirations of The National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policies D6(1) and D6(8) of The London Plan (2021), policies DM1.C and DM1.D(g) of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document Residential Design Guide (2010).\r\n",
    "Reason : 6 - The ground floor flat by reason by reason of the high level window serving the bedroom together with the proposed narrow windows to the living room to the second floor flat would result in an unacceptable level of outlook for the future occupiers of these units which would provide a unsatisfactory standard of residential accommodation for future occupiers. The proposed development is therefore contrary to the high quality design aspirations of The National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policies D6(1) and D6(8) of The London Plan (2021), policies DM1.C and DM1.D(g) of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document Residential Design Guide (2010).\r\n"
