    "Reason : 1 - The proposed first floor rear extension, by reason of its excessive depth and poor design, and its cumulative impact in conjunction with the existing first floor rear extension, would result in an unsympathetic, incongruous, visually intrusive, contrived and overbearing form of development which is discordant with the established pattern of development in the area, to the detriment of the character and appearance of the subject dwelling and the local area, contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policy D3.D (11) of The London Plan (2021), policy CS1.B on the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), policy DM1 of the Development Management Local Plans Policies (2013) and adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed first floor rear extension, by reason of its siting and excessive depth would be overbearing, resulting in a loss of light and overshadowing and would be detrimental to the visual and residential amenities of the occupiers of No. 2 Kenmore Road.
