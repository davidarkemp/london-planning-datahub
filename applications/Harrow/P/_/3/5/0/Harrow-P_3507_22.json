    "Reason : 1 - The proposed amendments would materially alter the appearance of the approved development and would give rise to potential amenity, flood risk and biodiversity impacts and would require further consultation and assessment against the Harrow Development Plan.  In addition, part of the amended pitch reconfiguration, proposed fencing, additional hardsurfacing and proposed structures fall outside of the original red line application site boundary.  The amendments would therefore require an application for planning permission"
