    "Reason : 1 - The cumulative impact of the proposed roof alterations to enlarge the main roofs at both properties, and two-storey front at No.54 and the two storey side extensions to both properties, by reason of excessive bulk, scale, massing and design would result in an unsympathetic, incongruous, top-heavy and visually intrusive form of development that fails to respect the scale, proportions and design of both host buildings and neighbouring properties and the wider streetscene and creates an unacceptable terracing effect, to the detriment of the character and appearance of the subject building, the wider pattern of development and visual amenities of the area, contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021) policy D3.D(1) and D3.D(11) of The London Plan (2021), policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012) and policy DM1 of the Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010)."
