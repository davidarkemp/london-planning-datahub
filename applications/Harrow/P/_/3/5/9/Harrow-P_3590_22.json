    "Reason : 1 - The proposed first floor side to rear extension to the eastern flank elevation and first floor rear extension by reason of their siting and excessive depth, would give rise to an overbearing form of development and would result in an unacceptable loss of outlook, loss of sunlight and overshadowing, to the detriment of the residential and visual amenities of the neighbouring occupiers at 169 and 173 Uxbridge Road contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D3 (7) of The London Plan (2021), Policy DM1 of the Development Management Policies Local Plan document (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed first floor rear extension; two storey rear infill extension and  first floor side to rear extension; by reason of their excessive width, depth, bulk and siting, would fail to provide a proportionate and subordinate addition to the host dwellinghouse, and would result in an overly dominant, bulky and cramped form of development, to the detriment of the character and appearance of the existing property, the neighbouring properties and the prevailing pattern of development in the street scene, contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D3 (D(1) and (11)) of The  London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010)."
