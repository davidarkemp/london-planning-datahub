    "Reason : 1 - Condition 6 attached to planning permission LBH/6596/1 dated 02/08/1972, removes permitted development rights for any development within the curtilage of the site of the host dwelling as set out in Part 1 of Schedule 2 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 1995 (or any order revoking or re-enacting that order with or without modification). Article 3(4) of The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development)(England) Order 2015 (as amended) states, nothing in this Order permits development contrary to any condition imposed by any planning permission granted. As such the installation of the outbuilding within the rear garden would not be permitted development.",
