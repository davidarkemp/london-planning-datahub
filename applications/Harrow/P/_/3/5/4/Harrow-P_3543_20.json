    "Reason : 1 - The proposed first floor side to rear extension, by reason of its excessive width, bulk, scale and massing, in conjunction with its prominent siting would introduce an overly dominant and disproportionate form of development into the area that would fail to respect the scale, character and appearance of the host dwellinghouse and that of the surrounding neighbouring properties. The development is therefore detrimental to the character and appearance of the host dwellinghouse and the prevailing pattern of development in the locality, contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), policies 7.4(B) and 7.6(B) of The London Plan (2016), Policies D1 and D3 of The London Plan (2019) - Intend to Publish, Core Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document Residential Design Guide (2010)."
