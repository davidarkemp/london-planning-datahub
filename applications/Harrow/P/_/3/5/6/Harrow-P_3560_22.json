    "Reason : 1 - The development by reason of excessive excavation of land and inappropriate materials of the retaining walls results in the basement appearing as a bulky incongruous development that is out of keeping with the traditional and high quality character of the locally listed building and which is out of keeping with the wider traditional character and appearance of the conservation area by cutting into the hill and undermining this traditional character and scale. The proposal is therefore contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies D3 (D(1) and (11)) and HC1 of The  London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 A, DM1 B (a), (b) and (c) and DM7 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).\r\n"
