    "Reason : 1 - The proposed loft floor plan shows a gable wall window which is not shown in the proposed side elevation.  Due to the inconsistencies within the submitted drawings and the failure to demonstrate that the proposed window would be obscure glazed and non opening unless the parts of the window which can be opened are more than 1.7 metres above the floor of the room in which the window is installed, the proposal would not be within the tolerances of Schedule 2, Part 1, Class B, B.2 (c) (i) (ii) of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 as amended.",
    "Reason : 2 - It has not been demonstrated that the proposed rooflights in the front roofslope would not protrude more than 0.15 metres beyond the plane of the slope of the original roof when measured from the perpendicular with the external surface of the original roof.  The proposal would therefore not be within the tolerances of Schedule 2, Part 1, Class C, C.1 (b) of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 as amended.",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposal is therefore not a lawful development."
