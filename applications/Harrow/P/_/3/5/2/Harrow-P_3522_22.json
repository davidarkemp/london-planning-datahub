    "Reason : 1 - The large patio doors and associated balcony located at the second floor, by reason of its siting, in relation to both adjoining neighbours and its design in relation to the host dwelling and wider area, is considered to be unacceptable and would give rise to unreasonable level of direct/perceived overlooking towards the adjoining properties to the detriment of the residential amenities of the neighbouring occupiers of Nos: 42 and 46 Brampton Grove and would give rise to an incongruous form of development to the detriment of the character and appearance of the host dwelling and the wider area, contrary to Policy National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D3(D(1), (D7) and D(11)) of The London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1 (B) of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed outbuilding by reason of its siting in Environment Agency Flood Zones 2 and 3 and the Harrow Strategic Flood Risk Assessment Zone 3A and in the absence of an adequate Flood Risk Assessment in relation to flood extent maps / data, compensatory flood storage, mitigation measures and drainage details would likely to result in the displacement of water onto adjacent land and fail to provide resilience to flooding, to the detriment of the safety of existing and future occupiers of the application site.  The proposal has therefore failed to demonstrate compliance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021),Policy SI 13 of The London Plan (2021), policy CS1.U of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012) and policies DM9 and DM10 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013).\r\n"
