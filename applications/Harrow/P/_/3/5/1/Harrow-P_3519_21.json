    "Reason : 1 -  The proposed dwellinghouse, by reason of its siting within the garden curtilage of 40 Spencer Road (now subdivided into 40A, 40B and 40C), would represent an inappropriate form of development, out of character with the pattern of development in the locality and would be at odds with the Council's spatial strategy for growth and directing new residential and other development to the Harrow and Wealdstone Opportunity Area, town centres and, in suburban areas, to strategic previously developed sites and would therefore harm its implementation, contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021),  Policy D3 (1) of The London Plan (2021),  Policies CS1.A and CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM 1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013), the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Garden Land Development (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed dwellinghouse, by reason of its layout, siting, scale, massing, and appearance would give rise to a cramped, obtrusive and incongruous addition, which would be visually intrusive, discordant and would amount to overdevelopment of the site and fail to represent a high quality of design, harmfully detracting from the surrounding pattern of development and the character and appearance of the locality, contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D3(1,11) of The London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document Residential Design Guide (2010).\r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed dwellinghouse, by reason of its layout, scale, massing and siting so close to the side and rear boundaries, would lead to an overbearing impact and result in overshadowing and overlooking of the neighbouring properties at 40A, 40B, 40C and 42B Spencer Road to the detriment of the residential and visual amenities of the occupiers, contrary to policy D3 (7) of the London Plan (2021), policy DM 1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).\r\n"
