    "Reason : 1 - The proposed extension, by reason of its excessive rearward projection and siting in relation to No. 84 and 88 Greenford Road would give rise to an overbearing, unneighbourly and visually obtrusive form of development which would result in an unacceptable loss of the outlook and visual amenity afforded to the rear gardens and adjacent rear facing habitable room windows of No. 84 and 88 Greenford Road. The proposed development would thereby be contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D3 D (7) of the London Plan (2021), Policy DM1 B. (a), DM1 C., and DM1 D. (d), (e) and (f) of the Development Management Policies Local Plan document (2013) and the relevant provisions of the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010)."
