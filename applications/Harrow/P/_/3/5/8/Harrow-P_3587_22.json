    "Reason : 1 - The details submitted in relation to the window material and colour, brickwork type, and roof tiles would be of poor quality, design and visual appearance and are not considered to adequately safeguard the appearance of the locality or ensure a satisfactory form of development. Additionally, insufficient and inadequate information regarding all other proposed facing materials and window reveal depths has been provided to enable the Local Planning Authority to assess whether the proposed development would provide satisfactory details to discharge all parts of Condition 3 (materials) and Condition 7 (windows and doors) of the proposed development contrary to policy D3.D1 and D3.D11 of The London Plan (2021), policy CS1 of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), policies DM1 and DM2 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the Supplementary Planning Document - Residential Design Guide (2010)",
    "Reason : 2 - The applicant has failed to demonstrate that the proposal would make appropriate provision of hard and soft landscaping to contribute to a high standard of design, layout and amenity, and does not make appropriate provision for the protection, enhancement, creation and management of biodiversity in order to discharge condition 8 (landscaping), contrary to The National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policies D3.D(1), D3.D(10) and G6(D) of The London Plan (2021), policy CS1.B and CS1.R of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), policies DM1.A, DM1.B(d)(e)(f); DM22(B) and DM23(C), DM45(C) of the Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the Supplementary Planning Document - Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 3 - The details submitted in respect of Conditions 12 and 13 relating to the disposal of sewage and surface water, surface water attenuation and storage works are insufficient to enable discharge of these conditions, due to the lack of appropriate drainage layout, section drawings with levels, dimensions of surface water storage tanks and their positions on plan, and confirmation that the surface water calculation has been provided from below the lowest point in the system. In the absence of such information, the local planning authority is unable to fully assess if the development will achieve a satisfactory form of development to prevent the risk of flooding and other or be able to incorporate appropriate mitigation, contrary to policies SI 5 and SI12 of The London Plan (2021), policy CS1 of the Harrow Core Strategy and policies DM9 and DM10 of the Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013)."
