  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - Details provided within the submitted application form indicate that 6 of the proposed units would be allocated as affordable rented units, however given that these units would fail to meet London Affordable Rent benchmark rents, they would not be genuinely affordable and would not sufficiently contribute to the borough�s stock of affordable housing. In failing to indicate which of the proposed units are to be allocated as affordable rented units, the Council cannot be satisfied that the sizes of the affordable rented units are acceptable in context with the target mix set out within the Council�s Planning Obligations and Affordable Housing Supplementary Planning Document (2013). In the absence of a viability assessment, the applicant has failed to demonstrate that it is not viable to provide the required contribution on-site. The proposed development would therefore by contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies H5, H6 A and H10 A of The London Plan (2021), Policies CS1.I and CS1.J of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM24 A and B of Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Planning Obligations and Affordable Housing.",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposal, by reason of its excessive height, scale, bulk and massing, would result in an incongruous, unsympathetic and contrived form of development which would appear out of scale and unduly overbearing when viewed along the street scene, at odds with other buildings located along within the area. By reason of its excessive scale and massing and the context of surrounding building heights, the proposed development is considered to form an overdevelopment of the application site. The proposal would thereby be contrary to the high quality aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies D3 D(1) and D3 D(11) of The London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policies DM1 A, DM1 B (a) and (c) of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013).",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed development would fail to provide a sufficient quantum of on-site children�s play space. The applicant has failed to make a commitment to providing an adequate cash in-lieu contribution to off-site children�s play space to mitigate the shortfall. The development would therefore provide a substandard form of accommodation to the detriment of children within the building. The proposal would therefore be contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the Nationally Planning Policy Framework (2021) and Policy S4 B of The London Plan (2021).",
    "Reason : 4 - The proposed development, by reason of its excessive height, scale, bulk, massing and proximate siting in relation to the rear gardens of properties directly to the north along Devonshire Road (Nos. 1, 3, 5, 7, 9) and Dorset Road (Nos. 1, 3, 5), would appear as unduly overbearing and unneighbourly when viewed from the rear gardens of these neighbouring properties, unduly restricting outlook and visual amenity afforded to these rear gardens. In addition, based on the elevated heights of the proposed rear access decks and rear facing habitable room windows sited at third and fourth floor levels, the proposed development is considered to result in significant additional overlooking in relation to the rear gardens of the aforementioned neighbouring properties, unduly restricting privacy afforded to these neighbouring occupants. The proposed development would thereby be contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D3 D(7) of The London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012) and Policies DM1 C and DM1 D (a), (b), (d) and (e) of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013).",
    "Reason : 5 - In failing to provide a sufficiently detailed Transport Statement, the applicant has failed to demonstrate that the development�s car parking provision is acceptable and would not result in unacceptable overspill parking on the surrounding highway network, and have failed to demonstrate that the proposal would not result in an excessive increase in trip generation in and around the site, and they have failed to demonstrate that the site can be sufficiently serviced without compromising highway and pedestrian safety as well as vehicular movement along the surrounding highway network. In addition to the above, the proposed development would fail to provide a sufficient quantum of both long and short stay cycle parking, and insufficient active charging facilities for proposed car parking. The proposed development would thereby be contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies T4 B, T5 A, T6 D, T6.1 A, T6.1 C, T7 G, I and K of the London Plan (2021), Core Policies CS1.R and CS1.S of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), and Policies DM42 F, DM 43 A, B, and C and DM44 A and C of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013).",
    "Reason : 6 - In the absence of sufficient information to demonstrate that the proposed development would achieve biodiversity net gain, and meet or exceed the London Urban Greening Factor Requirement, the Council cannot be satisfied that the proposed development would be in accordance with these requirements. The proposed development would thereby be contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies G5 A and G6 D of The London Plan (2021) Core Policies CS1.E and CS1.T of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012) and Policies DM12 A (c), DM20 and DM21 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013).",
    "Reason : 7 - In the absence of a detailed Energy Strategy quantifiably demonstrating that the proposed development would meet the net zero-carbon requirement for major development proposals by achieving a minimum on-site carbon reduction of at least 35% beyond building regulations, with at least 10% of this being achieved through energy efficiency measures, the Council cannot be satisfied that the development would achieve this. The applicant has failed to make a commitment to providing a cash in-lieu contribution towards the carbon shortfall to the Council�s carbon offset fund, and has not indicated that they would be making up for any shortfall on an appropriate alternative site. As a result, the proposal would fail to be an appropriately sustainable form of development. The proposed development would thereby be contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy SI 2 A, B, C and E of The London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1.T of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012) and Policies DM12 B and DM14 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013).",
    "Reason : 8 - The Proposed development, by reason of its failure to provide secure stair and lift cores, its failure to provide sufficient separation between residential, commercial and industrial components of the site, its failure to achieve full compartmentation, the lack of protection to bedroom windows directly facing exposed walkways to the rear, its failure to provide secure cycle parking, and insufficiency in details provided in regards to the development�s postal strategy and use of security products, could give rise to anti-social behaviour and significant risks of crime and disorder. The proposed development would thereby be contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework, Policy D11 C of The London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1.E of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM2 A (d) of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013). ",
    "Reason : 9 - In the absence of an air quality assessment, the Council cannot be satisfied that the proposed development would have an acceptable impact upon air quality within the area or provide an acceptable form of development for future occupiers. The proposed development would thereby be contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy SI 1 B, D and E of The London Plan (2021) and Core Policy CS1.T of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012)."
