    "Reason : 1 - The proposal would result in a newly created dwellinghouse being sited on garden land. As such, the principle of the development is contrary to the Harrow Core Strategy of directing new residential and other development to the Harrow and Wealdstone Opportunity Area, town centres and, in suburban areas, to strategic previously developed sites and would therefore harm its implementation, contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies CS1.A and CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Garden Land Development (2013).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed new dwelling, by reason of its single storey design, cramped backland siting, uncharacteristic positioning, poor street presence and failure to front the main highway would form an incongruous, unsympathetic and contrived dwelling, that would appear unduly at odds with the established pattern of residential dwelling development. It would be a design which is out of character as a standalone dwelling, at odds with the appearance of the wider area and adversely impacts upon the overall visual amenity of the wider area. The proposal would therefore be contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies D3.D(1) and D3.D(11) of The London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 A., DM1 B. (a), (c) and (d), DM22 and DM23 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposal, by reason of its inadequate outlook from both the front and rear, as a result of its poor siting and lack of street presence, with the proposed ground floor windows facing the boundaries of with Nos.76 and 78 would create a poor standard of living accommodation for future occupiers to the detriment of their residential amenity. As such, the proposal is contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies D3.D(7) of The London Plan (2021), Policy CS1 of the Harrow Core Strategy (2013), and policy DM1 and DM23 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013), the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide Supplementary Planning Document (2010)."
