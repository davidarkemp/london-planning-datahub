    "Reason : 1 - The development granted under application P/1221/21 has not been implemented in accordance with approved drawings with the roof of the development not being constructed and the brickwork associated with the extensions granted under application P/1221/21 not matching the brickwork applied to the exterior of the main dwellinghouses as was specified to be the case on the approved drawings and within the submitted application form. In failing to be constructed in accordance with the approved drawings for application P/1221/21 the development that is being constructed on site is technically unlawful. Given that the roof extensions proposed under this certificate of lawful development application are interconnected with unlawful works they would fail to accord with Section 3, 5(a) of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "Reason : 2 - The cubic content of the resulting roof space created by the roof extensions would exceed the cubic content of the original roof space by more than 50 cubic metres on a detached dwellinghouse. The proposal would therefore not be within the tolerances of Schedule 2, Part 1, Class B, B.1 (d) of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposal is NOT therefore a lawful development."
