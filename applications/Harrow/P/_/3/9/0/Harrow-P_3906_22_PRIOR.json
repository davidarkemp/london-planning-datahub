    "Reason : 1 - 1. The enlarged part of the dwellinghouse would attach to the existing outbuilding and would constitute a single development. As a result, the extension would extend beyond the rear wall of the original dwellinghouse by more than 6 metres and would extend beyond an original side wall of the dwellinghouse and would have a width greater than half the width of the original dwellinghouse. The proposal would therefore not be within the tolerances of Schedule 2, Part 1, Class A, A.1 (g) (i), (j) (iii) and (ja) of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 as amended."
