Therefore, the proposed use of the site as laser clinic would not constitute a material change of use and therefore, would not constitute development as defined by section 55 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended) and as defined by Article 3 sub-paragraph (1A) of the Town and Country Planning (Use Classes Order) 1987 (as amended).",
