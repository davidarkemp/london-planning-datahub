    "Reason : 1 - The proposal, by reason of its design, overall bulk, scale and large crown roof, would result in disproportionate additions which fail to positively respond to the original architecture of the host building and adversely affect the overall character and appearance of the host dwelling and its contribution to the wider street scene. As such, the proposal is therefore considered contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policy D3(D(1) and D(11)) of The London Plan (2021), policy CS1.B of The Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document Residential Design Guide (2010).\r\n"
