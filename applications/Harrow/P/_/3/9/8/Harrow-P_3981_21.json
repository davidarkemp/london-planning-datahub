    "Reason : 1 - Condition 3 of the parent application relating to the construction of the detached double garage and greenhouse (WEST/571/97/FUL), limits the use of the garage for purposes of parking of private motor vehicles (and domestic storage) only and for no other purposes. As such, the conversion of the garage to a habitable room for purposes of a gym with a shower room would thereby fail to form permitted development.Therefore, the proposed development would be contrary to Paragraph 3(4) (relating to Permitted Development) of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development)(England) Order as amended, which states that nothing in this Order permits developments contrary to any condition imposed by any planning permission granted or deemed to be granted under Part 3 of the Act otherwise than by this Order. ",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposal is therefore NOT a lawful development. "
