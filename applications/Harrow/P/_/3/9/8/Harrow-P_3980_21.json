    "Reason : 1 - The proposal does not indicate if the materials used in any exterior work shall be of a similar appearance to those used in the construction of the exterior of the existing dwellinghouse and therefore would fail to meet Condition B.2.(a) of Class B to Part 1 (Schedule 2) of The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 as amended.",
    "Reason : 2 - The submitted side, front and rear elevations are inconsistent and the proposal does not correctly indicate if all the edges of the rear dormer closest to the eaves of the original roof would be 0.2 metres or more from the eaves, measured along the roof slope from the outside edge of the eaves, and therefore would fail to meet Condition B.2.(b).(i).(bb) of Class B to Part 1 (Schedule 2) of The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 as amended.",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposal does not indicate if the proposed windows on either side walls of the dormer would be obscure-glazed and non-opening and therefore would fail to meet Condition of B.2.(c).(i) and (ii) of Class B to Part 1 (Schedule 2) of The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 as amended.",
    "Reason : 4 - The proposal does not indicate if the proposed rooflight in front roofslope would not protrude more than 0.15 metres beyond the plane of the slope of the original roof and is therefore not within the tolerances of C.1(b). of Class C to Part 1 (Schedule 2) of The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 as amended.",
    "Reason : 5 - The proposal is NOT therefore a lawful development."
