    "Reason : 1 - The proposed first floor extension would result in the loss of the distinctive roof profile at the rear and would result in a poorly designed, unsympathetic and incongruous extension due to its cluttered and overcrowded roofscape, pitch angle being at odds with the established roof form, lowered eaves height and siting within the existing roof form, to the detriment of the character and appearance of the host dwelling and the wider locality. The proposal would therefore be contrary to the high quality design aspirations of policies of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policies D3.D(1) and D3.D(11) of The London Plan (2021), policy CS1.B on the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), policy DM1 of the Development Management Local Plans Policies (2013) and adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).
