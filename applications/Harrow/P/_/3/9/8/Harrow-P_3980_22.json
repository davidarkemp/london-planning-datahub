    "Reason : 1 - The proposed rear dormer and roof extension, by reason of its excessive size and bulk, would result in an overly dominant form of development that would be unduly obtrusive and incongruous and would detract from the appearance of the subject property and adjacent, properties, to the detriment of the character and appearance of the subject property and the surrounding area, contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D3.D.1 and D.11 of The London Plan (2021), Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 of the Development Management Plan Local Policies (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposal, by reason of failure to demonstrate a sufficient overall Gross Internal floor Area (GIA), built-in storage space and in the absence of a proposed section drawing detailing the internal head heights of unit and a first floor plan, the proposal has failed to demonstrate that the unit would be provide an overall acceptable standard of living accommodation. The proposed development would therefore give rise to substandard and poor quality accommodation to the detriment of the residential amenities of the existing and future occupiers of the unit, contrary to policies DM1 C, DM1 D (g), DM26 A (a), and (c), and DM26 E of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013).
