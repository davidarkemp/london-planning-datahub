    "Reason : 1 - The proposal would result in a significant increase in bulk and massing that would create an overbearing and incongruous form of development resulting in a detrimental impact upon the appearance of the host property, harming the openness of the streetscene and the character of and appearance of the surrounding area. The proposal therefore fails to comply with the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), policies 7.4B and 7.6B of the London PLan (2016), Policy D3 of the draft London PLan - intend to publish version, Policy CS1 of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposal would result in an unneighbourly and overbearing form of development that would significantly harm the daylight/sunlight, outlook and privacy of neighbouring residential properties, particularly resulting in an unacceptable sense of enclosure and loss of daylight/sunlight and outlook to the rear facing windows of the first floor flats of No's 105 and 107 Burnt Oak Broadway, and resulting in unacceptable impacts upon the daylight/sunlight, outlook and privacy of the first floor flat of No. 8 Parkway. The proposed undercroft would also give rise to the real and perceived increase of criminal activity and anti-social behaviour. The proposal therefore fails to comply with policies  7.1, 7.3, and 7.6 of the London Plan (2016), Policies D1 of the Draft London Plan - intend to publish version (2019), Policy CS1E of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policies DM1 and DM2 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010) and the Mayors Housing SPG (2016)."
