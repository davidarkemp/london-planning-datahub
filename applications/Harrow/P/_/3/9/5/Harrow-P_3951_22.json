    "Reason : 1 - The proposals includes the removal of the pitched roof and the erection of a second storey extension on top of a new flat roof to the existing two storey back addition. The development proposes raising two walls of the outrigger and creating a third (rear) wall rising above the flat roof of the back addition and as a matter of fact and degree, the local planning authority considers that these works cannot properly be regarded simply as additions or alterations to the roof of the building. Assessing the works against Class A, it is concluded that they would be contrary to Class A, Part A. 1(d) on the basis that the eaves of the enlarged part are a storey higher than the eaves of the original dwelling. The proposed development would not therefore be within the tolerances of Schedule 2, Part 1, Class A, part A. 1(d) of The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 as amended.",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposal is NOT therefore a lawful development."
