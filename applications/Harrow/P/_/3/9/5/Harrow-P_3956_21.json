    "Reason : 1 - The conversion of the two storey side extension into a self-contained unit, by reason of its insufficient gross internal area, including failure to meet the minimum room width, lack of dedicated storage space and private amenity space, would result in a cramped, substandard  and overall poor quality of living accommodation for the future occupiers, contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021),  policies D3 and D6 of The London Plan (2021), policy CS1B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), policies DM1, DM26 and DM27 of the Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013), the Mayor of London Housing Supplementary Planning Guidance (2016) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The conversion of the two storey side extension into a self-contained unit, by reason of the overall design and its narrow form and layout, in this prominent siting, and its un-restricted access to the rear garden and ground floor rear windows of the original dwelling, results in an incongruous and inappropriate form of development which fails to respect the prevailing character and pattern of development in the area, and which is harmful to the host property in terms of loss of privacy to the rear garden and ground floor habitable rooms, to the detriment of the character and appearance of the streetscene and the locality, and the residential amenity of the occupiers of the original dwelling, contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D3 (1) and (7) of The London Plan (2021), Policy CS.1B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policies DM1, DM26 and DM 27 of the Development Management Plan Local Policies (2013) and the Adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010)."
