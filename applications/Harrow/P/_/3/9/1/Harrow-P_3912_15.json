    "Reason : 1 - The proposed two storey rear extension, by reason of excessive bulk, rearward projection and poor quality design, would result in a visually obtrusive and incongruous addition to the dwelling house which would fail to respect the character and appearance of the original property and the surrounding area contrary to Policies 7.4B and 7.6B of The London Plan 2015, Core Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy 2012, Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan 2013 and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide 2010.\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed two storey rear extension, by reason of excessive bulk and rearward projection, would result in an unduly obtrusive and overbearing extension which would be detrimental to the visual and residential amenities of the  occupiers of the neighbouring property at No 10 Warrington Road, and which would exacerbate such existing impacts to the further detriment of the occupiers at Nos 6a and 6b Warrington Road, contrary to Policy 7.6B of The London Plan 2015, Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan 2013 and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document Residential Design Guide 2010.\r\n"
