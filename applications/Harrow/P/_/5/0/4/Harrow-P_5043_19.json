    "Reason : 1 - The out-building, by reason of its siting in relation to the neighbouring site boundaries and its excessive scale and height, gives rise to a visually bulky and unduly dominant structure which is out of character with the pattern of development in the locality, to the detriment of the character and appearance of the area and the visual amenities of the neighbouring occupiers in particular no. 14 Old Forge Close, contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), policies 7.4 B and 7.6 B of The London Plan (2016),  Core Policy CS1 (B) of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), policy DM 1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document - Residential Design Guide (2010)."
