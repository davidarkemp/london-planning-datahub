    "Reason : 1 - The proposal, by reason of the loss of protected employment floor space which has not been sufficiently justified, or sufficient justification for the proposed D1 Use Class floorspace, would result in an unacceptable reduction in industrial and employment space within the London Borough of Harrow, which would be considered unacceptable in principle. The proposal is therefore considered to be contrary to  4.4 The London Plan (2016), policies E4 and E7 of The Draft London Plan (2019), policy CS1.O of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), policies AAP15 of the Harrow & Wealdstone Area Action Plan (2013), policies DM31 and DM46 of the Harrow Development Management Policies (2013).\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposal, fails to demonstrate that 60 units, alongside the required level of Affordable Housing at the required unit mix can be satisfactorily accommodated on this site and in the absence of a viability assessment to demonstrate a satisfactory provision of Affordable Housing which can meet the relevant policy criteria for either a viability-tested route or a threshold approach, cannot be considered to be in compliance with policy 3.11 and 3.12 of The London Plan (2016), policies H4, H5 and H6 of The Draft London Plan (2019), policies CS1.I and CS1.J of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), policy AAP13 of the Harrow & Wealdstone Area Action Plan (2013), policy DM24 of the Harrow Development Management Policies (2013), and the Greater London Authority's Affordable Housing and Viability Supplementary Planning Guidance (2017).\r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed development, by reason of its indicative height and building footprint, would result in a development that is cramped within its plot and has a poor relationship to its surroundings including neighbouring buildings, and is considered inappropriate for the site and its context. The proposal would therefore be contrary to policies 7.4 and 7.6 The London Plan (2016), policies D3 and D4 of The Draft London Plan (2019), policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), The London Plan Housing Supplementary Planning Guidance (2016), policies AAP4, AAP5 and AAP6 of the Harrow & Wealdstone Area Action Plan (2013), policies DM1 and DM2 of Harrow's Development Management Policies Local Plan document (2013), and the Council's adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010). \r\n",
    "Reason : 4 - The proposed development fails to demonstrate that up to 60 units can be satisfactorily accommodated on the site to provide adequate levels of daylight and sunlight to the proposed residential units, contrary to policy 3.5 The London Plan (2016), policies D3 and D6 of The Draft London Plan (2019), policy CS1.K of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), The London Plan Housing Supplementary Planning Guidance (2016), , policies AAP4 and AAP13 of the Harrow & Wealdstone Area Action Plan (2013)and the Council's adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).\r\n",
    "Reason : 5 - The proposal by reason of a failure to adequately demonstrate acceptable levels of daylight and sunlight to neighbouring properties and gardens, would result in an unacceptable degree of overshadowing and/or visual impacts and a heightened sense of enclosure, as well as an unacceptable degree of overlooking and loss of privacy, to the occupiers of the neighbouring properties Kap House, Havilland House, Watson House, nos. 50-52 and 79-81 Glenwood Close, and Ingram House. The proposal is therefore contrary to policy 7.6 of The London Plan (2106), policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), policy AAP4 of the Harrow & Wealdstone Area Action Plan (2013), and policy DM1 of Harrow's Development Management Policies Local Plan document (2013), and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide 2010.\r\n",
    "Reason : 6 - The proposal, by reason of its internal road layout and turning space, has failed to demonstrate satisfactory, safe and practical traffic and servicing arrangements, and would therefore be likely to result in unacceptable impacts on traffic flow and vehicular and pedestrian safety, contrary to policy 6.3 and 6.12 of The London Plan (2106), policies T1 and T4 of the Draft New London Plan (2019), policy AAP19 of the Harrow & Wealdstone Area Action Plan (2013), and policies DM1, DM43 and DM44 of Harrow's Development Management Policies Local Plan document (2013).\r\n"
