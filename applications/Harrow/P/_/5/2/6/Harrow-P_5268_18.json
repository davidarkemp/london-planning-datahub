    "Reason : 1 - The out-building, by reason of its siting in relation to the neighbouring site boundaries and its excessive scale and height, gives rise to a visually bulky and unduly dominant structure which is out of character with the pattern of development in the locality, to the detriment of the character and appearance of the area and the visual amenities of the neighbouring occupiers in particular no. 2 Barons Mead, contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National planning Policy Framework (2018), policies 7.4 B and 7.6 B of The London Plan (2016),  Core Policy CS1 (B) of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), policy DM 1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document - Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 2 - The development, by reason of creating a platform in the front of the outbuilding at a higher ground level than the rear elevation of the attached neighbour and the 2m deep roof overhang (balcony) and proximity to the adjoining residential property, results in an unacceptable degree of overlooking, and actual and perceived loss of privacy to the private rear garden and rear facing habitable room windows of the adjacent dwelling house, no.2 Barons Mead, to the detriment of their residential amenity, contrary to policy 7.6B of The London Plan (2016) and policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010)."
