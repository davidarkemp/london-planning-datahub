    "Reason : 1 - The proposed porch by reason of its maximum height of 3450mm would not comply with the relevant limitations set out in Schedule 2, Part 1, Class D, D.1, (c) of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended). ",
    "Reason : 2 - Insufficient information has been provided in respect of the existing site circumstances as it was evident from the site visit carried out on 07/02/2019 that there exists single storey rear extension which is not shown on the submitted plans/drawings. The Council is therefore unable to determine whether the proposed development would comply with the limitations of Class E, E.1,(b) of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).  ",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed outbuilding by reason of its excessive scale, together with the absence of any justification for the necessity of the excessive large scale of the outbuilding for the uses proposed, on the balance of probabilities would not be for purposes incidental to the enjoyment of the dwellinghouse. The proposal is therefore not within the tolerances set out in Schedule 2, Part 1, Class E of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended)",
    "Reason : 4 - The proposal is NOT therefore a lawful development"
