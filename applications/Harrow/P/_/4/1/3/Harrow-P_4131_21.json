    "Reason : 1 - In the absence of satisfactory evidence to verify the applicant's ownership of the site, and in light of contradictory information being provided by way of neighbour's objections, and the fact that the red line boundary provided on the submitted site location plan drawing(s) accommodates a vast area of land outside of the area of development, with numerous residential units being contained within this, officers are not satisfied that the applicant is the sole proprietor of the land. Officers are consequently not satisfied that the applicant has signed the correct ownership certificate within their application form and served the requisite notice to all of site's proprietors, contrary to clause 13 of Part 3 of the Town and Country Planning (Development Managements Procedure) (England) Order 2015.",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed garage building, by reason of its unduly prominent and unsympathetic roof form, which fails to be pitched away from the front facade of the building whilst incorporating an extensive ridge height, would form an incongruous, unduly bulky, top heavy and dominant addition to the application site and street scene, which would appear unduly at odds with other detached garage buildings within the area. The proposed development would thereby be contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policies D3.D(1) and D3.D(11) of The London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), and policies DM1 A., DM1 B. (a), (b) and (c) of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013).",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed garage building, by reason of its footprint, massing, extensive overall ridge height and proximate siting to the rear garden of No. 1 Hazelwood Close, would appear as unneighbourly, unduly overbearing and visually intrusive when viewed from the rear garden of No. 1 Hazelwood Close. The proposed development would thereby be contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policy D3.D(7) of The London Plan (2021), and policies DM1 D. (d) and (e) of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013)."
