    "Reason : 1 - The proposed signage, by reason of excessive size, prominent siting, plastic material, internal illumination and removing the division between the facias, would result in an obtrusive appearance, which would be inappropriate and at odds with the traditional village character of the area, and would therefore fail to preserve the character and appearance of the conservation area and the setting of the adjacent listed buildings, without clear and convincing justification nor public benefits to outweigh the harm, contrary to Sections 66 and 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990, the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policies HC1 C of the London Plan (2021), Core Strategy (2012), and policies DM5 and DM7 of the Development Management Policies Local plan (2013)."
