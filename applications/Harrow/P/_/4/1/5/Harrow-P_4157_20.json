    "Reason : 1 - The proposal, by reason of its siting and encroachment on private rear garden area, would constitute Garden Land Development and would be at odds with the Councils spatial strategy for growth to the detriment of the character and appearance of the locality would therefore harm its implementation and sustainable growth of the Borough and would harm the contribution that gardens make to the character of the area, contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), Policy 3.5A of The London Plan (2016), Core policies CS1.A and CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Garden Land Development (2013). \r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposal, by reason of its back-land siting in the rear garden and subdivision of the existing rear garden of No. 7 South Close and its habitable function, would represent an inappropriate form of development at odds with the character of the area and the prevailing pattern of development in the locality and lacking in natural surveillance, as well as real and/or perceived mutual overlooking and lack of privacy for future and neighbouring occupiers, poor outlook and security for future occupiers, and unacceptable visual impacts and increased noise and disturbance to neighbouring occupiers, contrary to policies 7.3, 7.4B and 7.6B of The London Plan (2016), policy D11 of the Publication London Plan (2020), policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), policy DM 1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).\r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposal has failed to demonstrate that its siting in close proximity to a tributary of The Yeading Brook would not result in an increased risk of river channel instability through damage to associated structures, increased  risk of flooding, or that it would not be prejudicial to flood defence interests. As such it would be contrary to policy 5.12 The London Plan (2016), policy SI 12 of the Publication London Plan (2020), and policy DM11 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013).\r\n"
