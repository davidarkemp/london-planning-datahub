    "Reason : 1 - The proposal, by reason of its rearward projection and siting, would be detrimental to the amenities of the neighbouring occupiers at no. 75 Argyll Road, contrary to Policy DM1 of the Development Management Policies Local Plan document (2013) and the relevant provisions of the adopted Harrow Supplementary Planning Document Residential Design Guide (2010).\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The enlarged part of the dwellinghouse would be within 2 metres of the boundary of the curtilage of the dwellinghouse and the height of the eaves of the enlarged part would exceed 3 metres above natural ground level. As such, it would not comply with limitation A.1(i) to Class A of Part 1 (of Schedule 2) of The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015, as amended.\r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - The eaves height and maximum height of the development as stated on the submitted application form has been incorrectly measured and has not been taken from the natural ground level due to the existing raised patio at the rear of the property. The developer has therefore provided incorrect information to comply with condition A.4(2)(a) of development permitted by Class A.1(f) to Part 1 (of Schedule 2) of The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015, as amended.\r\n",
    "Reason : 4 - The submitted proposal includes a raised patio with a height in excess of 300mm. As such, the proposal would not comply with limitations A.1(k)(i) to Class A of Part 1 (of Schedule 2) to The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015, as amended.\r\n"
