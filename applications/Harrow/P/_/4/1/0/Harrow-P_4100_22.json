    "Reason : 1 - The proposal would result in the additional dwellinghouse being sited on garden land. As such, the principle of the development is contrary to the Harrow Core Strategy of directing new residential and other development to the Harrow and Wealdstone Opportunity Area, town centres and, in suburban areas, to strategic previously developed sites and would therefore harm its implementation, contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies CS1.A and CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Garden Land Development (2013).",
    "Reason : 2 - The applicant has failed to submit the required Sequential and Exception Tests in line with the requirements of the National Planning Policy Framework (2012) and Policy CS1 V of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012). The proposal would therefore result in a development that is not directed to a site of lower flood risk in line with the Development Plan for the borough and would therefore fail to comply with the requirements of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021) and Policy CS1 V of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012) in relation to minimising the risk of flooding, to the potential detriment of the safety of future occupiers of the development and elsewhere in terms of flood risk.\r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - The applicant as failed to submit a Flood Risk Assessment and has therefore failed to demonstrate that the proposed development would not exacerbate the risk of flooding within the site or increase the risk and consequences of flooding elsewhere, contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policies SI12 and SI13 of The London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1 U of Harrow Core Strategy (2012) and policies DM9 and DM10 of the Harrow Development Management Polices Local Plan (2013).",
    "Reason : 4 - The proposed two storey side extension, by reason of its excessive width would give rise to a disproportionate addition which would fail to respect the proportions and subsume the host dwelling, it would also fail to provide a coherent pattern of development in the street scene thus would substantially harm the form, openness and proportion of the site, relationship with the properties in the locality accentuated by its prominent siting to the detriment of the character and appearance of the streetscene and the pattern of development within the surrounding area and would therefore be contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies D3.D(1) and D3.D(11) of The London Plan (2021), Policy CS.1B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 of the Development Management Plan Local Policies (2013) and the Adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).\r\n"
