    "Reason : 1 - The applicant has not confirmed that the materials for the proposed single storey rear extension shall be of a similar appearance to those used in the construction of the exterior of the existing dwellinghouse and is therefore not within the tolerances of Schedule 2, Part 1 Class A. 3 (a) of The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 as amended",
    "Reason : 2 - The cubic content of the resulting roof space would exceed the cubic content of the original roof space by more than 40 cubic metres for a terraced dwelling house and is therefore not within the tolerances of Schedule 2, Part 1 Class B.1 (d (i)) of The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 as amended",
