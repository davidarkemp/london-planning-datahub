    "Reason : 1 - The proposed two storey side extension by reason of its siting along the side boundary with No 29 Dalkeith Grove, would result in a loss of space about the building at first floor level, failing to enhance local context and respond to local distinctiveness. The proposal would thereby be contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies D3.D(1) and D3.D(11) of The London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposal by reason of the siting of the two storey side extension along the side boundary with No 29 Dalkeith Grove  and the bulky rear dormer, would result in closing the gaps and views out of the conservation area, and would fail to preserve the significance and special character of the adjacent Canons Park Conservation Area and the Grade II Listed Registered Park and Garden. There is not clear and convincing justification for the harm, nor public benefits to outweigh this harm. The proposed development is therefore contrary to the requirements of paragraphs 197, 199, 200 and 202 of National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies D3.D (1), D3.D (11) and HC1 of The London Plan (2021), Policies CS1.B and CS1.D of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policies DM1 and DM7 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013), the Adopted Supplementary Planning Document Residential Design Guide (2010) and the Canons Park Conservation Area Appraisal and Management Strategy (2013)."
