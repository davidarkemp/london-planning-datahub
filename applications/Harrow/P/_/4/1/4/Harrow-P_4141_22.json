  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development, in the absence of a satisfactory Ecological Assessment and the site's close proximity to the adjoining Borough Grade II Site of Importance for Nature Conservation and the Edgware Brook, fails to demonstrate either that the biodiversity value of the surrounding area would not be harmed, or protected. Furthermore, no details of how the development will secure a minimum 10% net biodiversity gain has been provided, contrary to The Environment Act (2021), The National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policy G6 of the London Plan (2021), and policies DM 48 A (b), DM 20 and DM 21 of the Harrow Development Management Polices Local Plan (2013).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposal, by reason of its siting within a Flood Storage Reservoir Basin and provision of an unsatisfactory Flood Risk Assessment and Surface Water Drainage Strategy, fails to demonstrate that the flood storage area would not be harmed and that the proposed development would not exacerbate the risk of flooding within the site or increase the risk and consequences of flooding elsewhere from both fluvial and surface water sources, to the detriment of the safety of the adjoining occupiers and land and the future users of the development, contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policies SI12 and SI 13 of the London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1 U of Harrow Core Strategy (2012) and policies DM 9, DM 10 and DM 18 of the Harrow Development Management Polices Local Plan (2013).",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposal by reason of it's siting in close proximity to London Underground transport infrastructure and its failure to demonstrate that the existing works undertaken unlawfully, and future proposed works would not have a detrimental effect on transport structures in the short and long term, would prejudice the safety and capacity of London's transport operations, contrary to Policy T3 of The London Plan (2021) and Land for Industry and Transport Supplementary Planning Guidance 2012.",
    "Reason : 4 - The Local Planning Authority has been unable to make an accurate and comprehensive assessment of the proposal regarding its impact on the character of the surrounding designated open space and area by reason of  insufficient information within the submitted plans and documents relating to the  proposed works including the spectator stand and groundsman hut, contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policy D3 D.1, D.11 and D.12 of the London Plan (2021), core policy CS 1 B and F of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012) and policy DM 18 C (c) and (d) of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013).",
    "Reason : 5 - The proposed development, by reason of failure to provide an adequate Noise Impact Assessment, would give rise to potentially unacceptable harmful noise, disturbance and nuisance impacts arising from the use of the pitches and the spectator stand, to the detriment of the residential amenities of the adjacent neighbouring occupiers, contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policies D3.D.7, D13 and D14 of the London Plan (2021) and policy DM 1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013)."
