    "Reason : 1 - The proposed side to rear extension, by reason of its associated increases in scale, mass, bulk, and volume, would be materially larger than the existing rear extension/dwellinghouse, and would therefore constitute inappropriate development in the Green Belt and would have a harmful impact on the openness and visual amenities of the Green Belt. The very special circumstances put forward by the applicant fail to clearly outweigh the harm to the Green Belt by reason of inappropriateness and there are no other material considerations that clearly outweigh the identified harm. The proposal would be contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy G2 of The London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1.B/F of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012) and Policies DM1 and DM16 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed side to rear extension by reason of its excessive width, scale, bulk, siting and design, would not preserve the character and appearance of the conservation area or special interest of the locally listed building or locally listed park and garden, and it would also harm the setting of the listed gate piers, and no public benefits have been demonstrated to outweigh the harm, nor clear and convincing justification provided. The proposal would therefore be contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies HC1 and D3.D(11) of the London Plan (2021), policies CS1.B  and CS1.D of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), policies DM1 and DM7 of the Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013).",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed side to rear extension by reason of its poor design and excessive scale, mass and bulk, would result in an unsympathetic, incongruous and unduly obtrusive development, to the detriment of the character and appearance of the existing building and area, contrary to the design aspirations of The National Planning Policy Framework (2021), The London Plan (2021), Core Policies CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document Residential Design Guide (2010)."
