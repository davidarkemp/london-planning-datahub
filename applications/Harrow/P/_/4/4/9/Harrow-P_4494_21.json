    "Reason : 1 - As per the approved site plan (P/4574/21) private gardens should be provided to the rear of plots 3 and 4. As per the proposed site plan it is proposed to partially enclose these gardens with a 1m high metal railing. In addition, it is not clear if there is a boundary treatment adjacent the NW boundary of the garden for plot 4, adjacent to the footpath providing access to the communal garden, cycle and refuse stores. Therefore, based on the submitted details the Local Planning Authority is not satisfied that a comprehensive boundary treatment would be provided to fully enclose the private gardens and provide a suitable level of privacy and amenity of the future occupiers of these units. It has therefore not been demonstrated that the proposal would comply with the high quality design aspirations of The National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policy D6 of The London Plan (2021) and policies DM1.B(d), DM1.D(i) and DM27.C of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan 2013. \r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - Insufficient details have been submitted to the satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority in relation to the location, appearance and type (including security features) of gates to secure the private/communal garden areas. In addition, insufficient information has been submitted with regards to the appearance and opacity of the first floor privacy screens. Therefore, it has not been demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority that the proposal would comply  with the high quality design aspirations of The National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policy D11 of The London Plan 2021, policies CS1.B and CS1.E of The Harrow Core Strategy 2012 and policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan 2013. \r\n"
