    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development by reason of its poor design, excessive bulk and scale and lack of visual containment for the proposed rear dormer, would result in a disproportionate, contrived, overly dominant and visually obtrusive addition to the roof that would fail to respect the proportions, appearance and scale of the original dwellinghouse, thereby resulting in a detrimental impact to the character and appearance of the original dwellinghouse and the surrounding area. The proposal is therefore contrary to the high quality design aspirations of The National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policy D3.D1 and D.11 of The London Plan (2021), policy CS1. B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), policy DM1 of the Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010)"
