    "Reason : 1 - The proposed rear dormer together with the existing two storey rear outrigger and, by reason of their combined excessive scale, bulk and poor design would give rise to a contrived and incongruous form of development and result in excessive and overly dominant extensions which would fail to respect the proportions and scale of the original dwellinghouse. The proposal is contrary to the high quality design aspirations set out in the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policies D3.D(1) and D3.D(11) of The London Plan (2021), policy CS1.B on the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), policy DM1 of the Development Management Local Plans Policies (2013) and adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposal development, by reason of the additional bedroom within the roof space would create a two storey 4bed/5person unit and would fail to meet the minimum space standards resulting in a cramped and substandard living accommodation for future occupiers. As such the proposal is contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework, Policy D3 of The London Plan (2021), policies DM 1 and DM 26 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013), the Mayor of London Supplementary Planning Guidance (2016), and the adopted Residential Design Guide Supplementary Planning Document (2010)."
