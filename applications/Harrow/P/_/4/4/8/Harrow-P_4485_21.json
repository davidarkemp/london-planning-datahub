  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The new roof form and eaves of the two storey side and rear extension, would be set partly below the eaves of the main dwelling, extending partly off the side elevation wall of the original dwellinghouse. This effectively means that this element of the development would need to be assessed in line with Class A of Schedule 2, Part 1 of The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended). The altered roof form and eaves of the two storey side and rear extension would need to be assessed alongside the main structure of the two storey side extension itself given that they are adjoined. This element of the development would be located within 2 metres of the boundary of the curtillage, and would cumulatively have an eaves height greater than 3 metres. Furthermore, this element of the development would extend beyond a wall forming a side elevation of the original dwellinghouse, and would exceed 4 metres in height and have more than a single storey. The proposal would thereby be contrary to criterion A.1 (ja) of Class A of Schedule 2, Part 1 of The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended). Finally, this element of the development would result in an alteration to the roof of the dwellinghouse, with it involving changes to the existing roof form of the two storey side extension, contrary to criterion A.1 (k) (iv) of Class A of Schedule 2, Part 1 of The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "Reason : 2 - No indication has been provided on whether or not the new flank first floor window would be obscure glazed and non-opening where it is not set above 1.7 metres above internal floor level. In the absence of satisfactory information to verify this, the Council cannot assume that this would be the case. The proposed development would thereby be contrary to Condition A.3 (b) (i) (ii) of Class A of Schedule 2, Part 1 of The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposal is therefore not a lawful development."
