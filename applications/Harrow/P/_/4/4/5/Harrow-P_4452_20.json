    "Reason : 1 - The proposal, by reason of its inappropriate design, scale and siting adjacent the front boundary, and the significant loss of mature hedging, greenery and the existing pond and potential impacts on adjacent protected trees, would result in harm to the character and appearance of the site and the local area. The proposal is thereby considered to be contrary to policy DM3 (D(1) and D(11)) of The London Plan (2021), policy CS.1 of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012) and policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013).\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed development, in the absence of an adequate Arboricultural report of the site to assess the impacts of development on the protected trees adjacent to the proposed development, would be likely to result in the harm to the protected trees, contrary to policy G7 of The London Plan (2021), and policy DM22 of the Harrow Development Management Policies (2013).\r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed development, in the absence of an adequate preliminary ecological assessment of the site to assess the impacts of development on biodiversity both on and adjacent the site, would be likely to result in the loss of and harm to the quality and extent of biodiversity and habitat, and would fail to provide for net biodiversity gain, contrary to policy G6 of The London Plan (2021), and policies DM20 and DM21 of the Harrow Development Management Policies (2013).\r\n",
    "Reason : 4 - The proposed access, by reason of its siting and in combination with the proposed front boundary treatment, would not allow for adequate visibility to and from Waxwell Lane. The proposal would thereby be likely to give rise to detrimental impacts on highway safety, contrary to policy DM42.E of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan document (2013).\r\n"
