    "Reason : 1 - The proposed part single part two storey front side and rear extension by reason of its excessive combined width, bulk, scale and massing, is considered to represent an overdevelopment of the site, which would appear unduly at odds with the established pattern of development along the street scene and within the wider area. The proposal would thereby be contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D3 (1) and (11) of The  London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 A., DM1 B. (a), (c) and of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 2 - The first floor front and side element of the extension, by reason of the fact that it would fail to be sufficiently set back from the front of the existing dwellinghouse, the adjacent side boundary with No. 55 Suffolk Road, and is to extend the dwellinghouse further forward at first floor level, would from an insubordinate addition to the dwellinghouse, which would unduly diminish the spacious gap between No. 53 and No. 55 Suffolk Road at first floor level resulting in a harmful terracing effect along the street scene. Furthermore, the replicated cat slide roof and projecting front windows associated with this element of the extension would relate poorly to the character and appearance of the original dwelling, it would not offset the loss of the original cat slide roof and projecting first floor front window, and would form an alien addition to the street scene and area. The proposal would thereby be contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D3 (1) and (11) of The  London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 A., DM1 B. (a), (b), (c) and (d) of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 3 - The ground floor front and side element of the extension, by reason of the fact that it would fully subsume the dwellinghouse's prominent original front portico and would uncharacteristically be set forward of the original portico would form an incongruous, unsympathetic and insubordinate addition to the host dwelling which would unduly detract from its original character and appearance, and would appear unduly at odds with the established uniformity of front and side extensions along the street scene. The proposal would thereby be contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D3 (1) and (11) of The  London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 A., DM1 B.
