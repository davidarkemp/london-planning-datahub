    "Reason : 1 - The proposed rear dormers by reason of their excessive quantity, lack of proportional symmetry, excessive combined bulk and massing and lack of set back from the eastern side boundary in the case of the eastern dormer; would form an incongruous, disproportionate, and overly dominant form of development which would result in a harmful visual cluttering of the rear elevation of the building. The proposed development would thereby be contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D3 (1) and (11) of the London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 A, DM1 B (a) and (b) of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013), in addition to the adopted Residential Design Guide Supplementary Planning Document (2010).",
    "Reason : 2 - The expanded dwelling would fail to provide a sufficient overall Gross Internal Area (GIA) and a sufficient amount of built-in storage space in line with the prescribed standards set out within the London Plan and Nationally Described Space Standards issued by the Department for Communities and Local Government on 27th March 2015. Furthermore, in the absence of a proposed section drawing detailing the internal head heights of unit, the Council cannot be satisfied that the unit would be provided with sufficient internal head heights. The proposed development would therefore give rise to substandard and poor quality accommodation to the detriment of the residential amenities of the future occupiers of the units contrary to policies DM1 C, DM1 D (g), DM26 A (a), and (c), and DM26 E of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013)."
