    "Reason : 1 - The proposed three storey building, by reason of its, bulk and roof form, poor design and its excessive depth, and by reason of the proposed first and second floor balconies fronting Whitefriars Drive, would introduce an incongruous and obtrusive form of development which would fail to respect the character, massing, form and composition of the neighbouring properties and surrounding area, and would give rise to overdevelopment of the subject site. The proposal would therefore fail to meet with the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), and would conflict with Policies D3 (D(1) and D(11)), of The London Plan (2021), Policy CS1.B of the Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 of the Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposal, by reason of the siting of the three storey building and its relationship with the neighbour at No 199 High Road, and by reason of the height and siting of the proposed brick wall along this shared boundary with No 199 High Road, would result in an overbearing impact, loss of outlook and sense of enclosure for the occupiers of No 199 High Road, contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D3(D(7)) of The London Plan (2021), Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposal, by reason of the siting of ground, first and second floor balconies and windows on the front, side and rear elevations  would result in actual and perceived overlooking and an unacceptable loss of privacy for the future occupiers of the proposed flats, the occupiers of No 199 High Road, and the occupiers of 2a Whitefriars Drive, to the detriment of residential amenity of these occupiers and contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies D3 (D(7)) of The London Plan (2021), Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 4 - The proposal, by reason of the poor siting of the proposed cycle store, refuse store and poor stacking arrangement between ground, first and second floor flats and proposed commercial space would result in undue noise and disturbance, unpleasant odours and fumes arising from the refuse store in relation to the occupiers of unit 3 and an overall poor quality of living accommodation for the future occupiers, to the detriment of their residential amenity, contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies D3 (D(7)) and D6 of The London Plan (2021), Policies DM1 and DM 45 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013), and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 5 - The proposal, by reason of lack of defensible space for units 1 and units 3, poor outlook from the kitchen/living area of unit 1, single bedrooms of units 6 and 8 and the poor design of balconies for unit 5 and 6, would result in loss of privacy and poor outlook, amenity space and overall poor quality of living accommodation for the future occupiers, to the detriment of their residential amenity, contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies D3 (D(7)) and D6 of The London Plan (2021), Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013), and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 6 - The proposed internal cycle store, by reason of its cramped and poor location and visitor parking cycle space on the High Road, by reason of its siting outside of the application site boundary, would fail  to contribute towards sustainable transport objectives, contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework 2021, policy T5 of The London Plan (2021) and policy DM42 of the Harrow Development management Policies Local Plan (2013)."
