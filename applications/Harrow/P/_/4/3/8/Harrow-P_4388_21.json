    "Reason : 1 - The proposed rear dormer by the reason of its prominent siting and size, and the material proposed in the gable end, would not achieve visual containment and would not match the materials of the existing building. Therefore, it is considered to result in an incongruous and inappropriate form of development interrupting the character of the main house and attached neighbour to the detriment of the character and appearance of the original set of dwellinghouses and the established pattern of development in the area. The development therefore fails to meet the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), and is contrary to Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021), Core Strategy Policy CS1.B (2012), policies DM1 and DM26 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Harrow Supplementary Planning Document Residential Design Guide (2010)."
