    "Reason : 1 - The rear single storey infill extension would exceed 4 metres in height when measured from the natural ground level to the top of the false roof. The proposal would therefore not be within the tolerances of Schedule 2, Part 1, Class A, A.1 (f)(ii) of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "Reason : 2 - The rear single storey infill extension would be connected to existing enlargements to the front and side of the property via the roof over the garden room and converted garage. Planning permission P/3144/05/DCP on 02/02/2006 granted permission for the garage to be widened towards the front of the house, on either of its sides. These enlargements when read together with the proposed, would result in the dwellinghouse being extended beyond walls forming side elevations of the original dwellinghouse, while exceeding 4 metres in height when measured from the natural ground level to the top of the false roof. The proposal would therefore not be within the tolerances of Schedule 2, Part 1, Class A, A.1 (j)(i) and (ja) of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "Reason : 3 - The rear single storey infill extension would connect directly to an existing garden terrace, which forms a raised platform, granted planning permission under P/3144/05/DCP on 02/02/2006. The proposal would therefore not be within the tolerances of Schedule 2, Part 1, Class A, A.1 (k)(i) of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "Reason : 4 - The rear single storey infill extension would be on article 2(3) land (i.e., located within Pinner Hill Estate conservation area) and extend beyond a wall forming the side elevation (western flank) of the garden room and a wall forming the side elevation (eastern flank) of the verandah. The proposal would therefore not be within the tolerances of Schedule 2, Part 1, Class A, A.2 (b) of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "Reason : 5 - The rear single storey infill extension would be connected to existing enlargements to the front and side of the property via the roof over the garden room and converted garage. Planning permission P/3144/05/DCP on 02/02/2006 granted permission for the garage to be widened towards the front of the house, on either of its sides. These enlargements when read together with the proposed, would result in the dwellinghouse being extended beyond walls forming side elevations of the original dwellinghouse, while being located on article 2(3) land (i.e., located within Pinner Hill Estate conservation area). The proposal would therefore not be within the tolerances of Schedule 2, Part 1, Class A, A.2 (ca) of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "Reason : 6 - The dormer roof extensions are proposed in the roof of a dwellinghouse located on article 2(3) land (i.e., located within Pinner Hill Estate conservation area). The proposal would therefore not be within the tolerances of Schedule 2, Part 1, Class B, B.1 (f) of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "Reason : 7 - It is not clear from the information provided if the proposed rooflight in the main rear roof slope would protrude more than 0.15 metres beyond the plane of the slope of the original roof when measured from the perpendicular with the external surface of the original roof. The proposal would therefore not be within the tolerances of Schedule 2, Part 1, Class C, C.1 (b) of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "Reason : 8 - It is not clear from the information provided if the  proposed sunpipes, one in each side roofslope would protrude more than 0.15 metres beyond the plane of the slope of the original roof when measured from the perpendicular with the external surface of the original roof. The proposal would therefore not be within the tolerances of Schedule 2, Part 1, Class C, C.1 (b) of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "Reason : 9 - The proposal is therefore a not a lawful development."
