    "Reason : 1 - The proposed two storey side extension by reason of its lack of set in from the side boundary in conjunction with its prominent corner siting would result in a dominant and incongruous form of development and an uncharacteristic loss of openness to the spatial setting of the locality to the detriment of the character and appearance of the existing dwellinghouse, the streetscene and the established and prevailing pattern of development in the area, contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D3.D (1) and (11) of The London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed first floor rear extension by reason of its excessive width and bulk with its prominent siting on a corner site, would introduce an incongruous, overly dominant and obtrusive form of development that would fail to respect the proportions of the existing dwellinghouse and the character and appearance of the neighbouring properties, to the detriment of the character and appearance of the existing dwellinghouse and the surrounding area, contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D3.D (1) and (11) of The London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed two storey side to rear extension, in conjunction with the proposed roof extensions to the property, would result in discordant and ungainly cumulative additions to the dwelling. In addition, the proposed rear dormer extension by reason of its significant width, bulk and mass would dominate the rear roof slope. The dormer extension would fail to integrate with vernacular of the existing property, would create an obtrusive and incongruous form of development which would be at odds, would appear strident and would not be subordinate or respect the scale and proportions of the external appearance of the roof and elevation in which the dormer window would be constructed. The development therefore fails to meet the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), and is contrary to Policy D3.D (1) and (11) of the London Plan (2021), Core Strategy Policy CS1.B (2012), Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Harrow Supplementary Planning Document Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 4 - The proposed two storey rear extension, by reason of its significant rearward projection, excessive width and siting in close proximity to No. 5 Floriston Close, would give rise to an overshadowing and overbearing visual impact to the detriment of the residential and visual amenities of the occupiers of this neighbouring property, contrary to Policy D3.D (7) and (11) of the London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and guidance contained in the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010)."
