    "Reason : 1 - The proposed two storey side extension, together with extensions currently being constructed to the property, by reason of their combined overall size, scale and massing, would be materially larger than the original built form at the site, thereby representing an inappropriate form of development which would harm the openness and character of the Green Belt. As such, the proposal fails to comply with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policy G2 of The London Plan (2021), policy CS1.B and CS1.F of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), and policies DM1 and DM16 of Harrow Development Management Policies (2013).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed two storey side extension, by reason of its bulky, awkward, contrived and unduly complex form, together with it poor assimilation with the roof form of the main dwelling, use of unsympathetic fenestration, the resulting subsumption of the dwellinghouseï¿½s distinct side chimney stack, the resulting loss of openness to the side of the dwelling, and its combined overall bulk and massing together with extensions currently being constructed to the property; would result in an incongruous and unsympathetic form of the development that would unduly detract from the original character, form, and appearance of the main dwelling, and would detract from the character and setting of the Pinner Hill Estate Conservation Area, and the Area of Special Character within which the application site is located. The proposed development would thereby be contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies D3 D(1), D3 D(11) and Policy HC1 C of the London Plan (2021), Core Policies CS1.B and CS1.D of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policies DM1 A, DM1 B (a), (b) (c), (d), DM6 A (a), (b), (c), DM6 C, DM7 A, DM7 B (a), (b), (c) and DM7 D of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013), the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010),  and the Pinner Hill Conservation Area Appraisal and Management Strategy (2009)."
