  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed single storey side extension, the excessively deep rear extension spanning the full width of the extended property and the proposed first floor rear when considered with the existing extensively extended building on this site, by reason of their combined bulk massing, and unsatisfactory design and prominent siting on a corner site would result in an unsympathetic, incongruous, bulky and contrived form of development that fails to respect the character, composition, proportion and design of the host dwelling, would further unbalance the appearance of the semi-detached pair of properties that the site forms part of and prevailing pattern of development in within the area. The proposal would thereby be contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D3 (1) and (11) of The  London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 A, DM1 B (a) and (b) of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - Flats 80B and 8C would fall below the minimum space standards required for 2 bedroom (3 persons) units and would fail to provide adequate internal storage. The proposed development would therefore give rise to a sub-standard and cramped living environment to the detriment of the residential amenities of the existing and future occupiers of the flats, contrary to policy D6, of The London Plan (2021), policies DM1 and DM26 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013), the Mayor of London Housing Supplementary Planning Guidance (2016) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Documents Residential Design Guide (2010)\r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed single side and rear extensions would encroach on the communal amenity space and private amenity space serving Flats 80B and 80C, and Flat 80A respectively which would result in a cramped layout and unusable space which would be exacerbated by the location of the communal bins and cycle storage located within the proposed communal amenity space.  The proposal is therefore contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies D3.D(5), D3.D5(7) and D6 of The London Plan (2021), Policies DM1 and DM26 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document Residential Design Guide (2010).\r\n\r\n"
