    "Reason : 1 - The proposed single storey rear extension including flank wall window, by reason of its depth, siting and height in relation to No. 27 Snaresbrook Drive and  flank wall window, by reason of its siting, size and use, would give rise to overshadowing and loss of light and would appear as a visually dominant and bulky form of development for the occupiers of No. 27 and would result in actual and perceived overlooking for the occupiers of No. 31 Snaresbrook Drive, to the detriment of the visual and residential amenities of the adjoining occupiers, contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework, policy D3 D (7) of The London Plan (2021),  policy DM1 of the Development Management Local Plans Policies (2013) and adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).
