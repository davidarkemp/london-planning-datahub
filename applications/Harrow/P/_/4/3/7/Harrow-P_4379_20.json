    "Reason : 1 - The proposed details provided are considered insufficient to meet to requirement of Condition 3 attached to planning permission P/1629/20 in order to comprehensively assess the merits of this application and its acceptability in relation to the character and appearance of the locality of the conservation area and the setting of the listed building. Therefore, it has not been demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority that the proposed development would safeguard the appearance of the conservation area and the locality or the setting of listed building. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies D3 D(12) and HC1 of The London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1(B) of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012) and policies DM1 and DM7 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013)."
