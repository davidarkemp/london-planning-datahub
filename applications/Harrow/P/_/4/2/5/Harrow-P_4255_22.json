    "Reason : 1 - The proposed internal layouts of flats 1 and 4, by reason of their orientation and siting in relation to the south-eastern site boundary and roof light serving the duplex flat 4 living area along with the side window serving the double bedroom of flat 1, would result in overlooking and loss of privacy from the shared side access and would fail to provide an adequate means of light and outlook to the detriment of the residential amenities of the potential future occupiers of these flats. The proposal is therefore contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies D3 (D(7))and D6 of The London Plan (2021), Policies DM1 and DM26 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document Residential Design Guide (2010).\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The vertical stacking between flats 2, 3 and 4 by reason of their internal layouts would result in bedrooms overlapping living rooms and bathrooms and would have an unacceptable impact on the future occupiers in terms of noise transference and disturbance. The proposal is therefore contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D3 (D(7)) of The London Plan (2021), Policies DM1 and DM26 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed development by failure to provide adequate private amenity spaces for flats 2, 3 and 4, in conjunction with the potential poor and inappropriate sub-division of the garden would result in a substandard quality of living accommodation to the detriment of the residential amenities of future occupiers of the residential units and would be out of keeping with the character and pattern of development in the area contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021),  policies D3 and D6 of The London Plan (2021), policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), policies DM1 and DM26 of the Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013), the Mayor of London Housing Supplementary Planning Guidance (2016) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).\r\n\r\n",
    "Reason : 4 - \r\nThe development, by failure to provide adequate bin storage for the flats, would give rise to potential for bins to be stored within the forecourt, resulting in visual clutter and an impractical arrangement with restricted access to the entrance of the building to the detriment of the character and appearance of the host building and streetscene and residential amenities of the future occupiers of the flats. As such, the development would be contrary to DM1, DM26 and DM45 of the Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).\r\n\r\n"
