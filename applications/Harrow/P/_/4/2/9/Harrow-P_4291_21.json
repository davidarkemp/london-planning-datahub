    "Reason : 1 - Within the context of the reserved matters permission P/2982/15 granted on 26/10/15, the proposed variation of condition 1 to block two pedestrian and cycle access points on the southern boundary of the site (providing access from the site to and from adjacent neighbouring residential roads - Edward Road and Sidney Road), with a close boarded fence in both locations would fail to provide sufficient information to demonstrate that the proposal would result in  the creation of a safer neighbourhood. Furthermore, the proposal would also compromise the permeability of the site and its integration with the wider streetscape and existing surrounding built context as well as failing to meet the aim to create Healthy Streets through the reduction in car dominance contrary to policies D3, D5, D8, D11 and T5 of The London Plan (2021), policy CS1 of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012) and policies DM1 and DM2 of the Harrow Development Management Polices Local Plan (2013)."
