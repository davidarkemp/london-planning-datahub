    "Reason : 1 - The proposed end gables and rear dormer roof extensions, when considered with the approved two storey side to rear extensions (granted under ref: P/2809/22) by reason of their excessive combined bulk, massing, poor design, prominent siting and the first floor rear elements awkward and visually cluttered amalgamation with the proposed rear dormer, would form an incongruous, discordant, contrived, unduly bulky and dominant addition to the host dwelling and street scene. The proposal would thereby be contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies D3.D(1) and D3.D(11) of The London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 A., DM1 B. (a), (b) and (c) of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).\r\n"
