    "Reason : 1 - The proposed rear and side extension, by the reason of the variety of roof designs and heights, would result in an incongruous and inappropriate form of development, interrupting the character of, and failing to harmonise with, the main house and the street scene, to the detriment of the character and appearance of the original set of dwellinghouses and the established pattern of development in the area. The development therefore fails to meet the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), and is contrary to Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021), Core Strategy Policy CS1.B (2012), policies DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Harrow Supplementary Planning Document Residential Design Guide (2010)."
