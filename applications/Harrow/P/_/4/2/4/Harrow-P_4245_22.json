    "Reason : 1 - The proposed self-contained annexe would facilitate a single dwellinghouse being sited on garden land. As such, the principle of the development is contrary to the Harrow Core Strategy of directing new residential and other development to the Harrow and Wealdstone Opportunity Area, town centres and, in suburban areas, to strategic previously developed sites and would therefore harm its implementation, contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies CS1.A and CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012) and the Adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Garden Land Development (2013).\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed outbuilding, by reason of its siting, form and layout, introduces an incongruous and poor form of development, which fails to respect the prevailing pattern of development in the area, and fails to satisfactorily relate to its surroundings and its local context. The development therefore fails to meet the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), and is contrary to Policy D3.D(1) and D.3.D(11) of The London Plan (2021), Core Strategy Policy CS1.B (2012), Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Plan Local Policies (2013), and the Adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed outbuilding, by reason of its siting and scale would give rise to an overbearing, unneighbourly and visually obtrusive form of development which would result in an unacceptable impact on the amenities of Nos. 6 and 8 Moorcroft Way. The proposed development would thereby be contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D3 D (7) of the London Plan (2021), Policy DM1 of the Development Management Policies Local Plan document (2013) and the relevant provisions of the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010)."
