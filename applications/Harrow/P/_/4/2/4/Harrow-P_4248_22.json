    "Reason : 1 - \r\nThe amalgamation of the proposed alterations to roof to form end gables and rear dormer combined with the side extension lean to roof, competing bay window design to the front and rear extension roof which intercepts the main roof together with the siting on a prominent corner plot by reason of their excessive combined bulk, massing, poor design and prominent siting would form an incongruous, discordant, contrived, unduly bulky and dominant addition to the host dwelling and street scene, contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D3 (D(1) and (11)) of The  London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 A, DM1 B (a), (b) and (c) of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed window in the side elevation of the proposed rear extension, by reason of its siting and close proximity to the boundary facing No.8 Hereford Gardens would create direct and perceived overlooking towards this neighbouring site, leading to an unacceptable impact on the residential amenities in terms of loss of privacy of the neighbouring property at No. 8 Hereford Gardens, contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D3.D(7) of The London Plan (2021), policy DM 1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010)."
