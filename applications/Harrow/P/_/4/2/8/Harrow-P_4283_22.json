    "Reason : 1 - The proposed first floor front and side and rear extensions and crown roof, by reason of poor design and overall bulk, massing, and scale, would result in visually dominant and overbearing additions which would fail to positively respond to the original architecture of the host building and would subsume the original dwellinghouse. In addition, the front and rear dormers, given their size, poor design and number, would result in a cluttered roof form. As such, the proposal would adversely affect the overall character and appearance of the host dwelling and its contribution to the wider street scene. The proposal is therefore considered contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policy D3(D(1) and D(11)) of The London Plan (2021), policy CS1.B of The Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document Residential Design Guide (2010)."
