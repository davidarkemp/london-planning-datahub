  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed two storey side extension, due to its form, siting, size and scale would result in a form of development which is bulky and unduly obtrusive. It would subsume the original dwellinghouse and would be unduly prominent within the streetscene, especially as the flank wall is highly visible within the streetscene, due to its location on the corner of Latimer Gardens and Latimer Close and due to the changes in ground level. The proposed two storey side extension would therefore have a detrimental impact to the character and appearance of the original dwellinghouse and to the setting of the Pinnerwood Park Estate Conservation Area. The proposal is therefore contrary to the high quality design aspirations of The National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policies D3.D(1) and D.3D(11) and HC1 of The London Plan (2021), policy CS.1.B of The Harrow Core Strategy (2012), policies DM1 and DM7 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013), the adopted Residential Design Guide Supplementary Planning Document (2010) and the Pinnerwood Park Conservation Area Appraisal and Management Strategy 2008.",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed porch would project beyond the front elevation of the dwellinghouse and would result in the loss of the original porch and would result in the loss of the existing timber front door. Therefore, the proposed front porch due to its size, siting, appearance and use of materials would be unsympathetic to the special character and appearance of the original dwellinghouse and the Pinnerwood Park Estate Conservation Area. The proposed front porch is therefore contrary to the high quality design aspirations of The National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policies D3.D(1) and D.3D(11) and HC1 of The London Plan (2021), policy CS.1.B of The Harrow Core Strategy (2012), policies DM1 and DM7 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013),  the adopted Residential Design Guide Supplementary Planning Document (2010) and the Pinnerwood Park Conservation Area Appraisal and Management Strategy 2008.",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed conservatory due to its excessive size, scale, appearance and the proposed use of poor quality materials would result in a development which is wholly out of keeping with the use of high quality traditional materials in the conservation area. Therefore, the proposed conservatory, given its size, scale, appearance and use of materials would be unsympathetic to the special character and appearance of the original dwellinghouse and the Pinnerwood Park Estate Conservation Area. The proposed conservatory is therefore contrary to the high quality design aspirations of The National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policies D3.D(1) and D.3D(11) and HC1 of The London Plan (2021), policy CS.1.B of The Harrow Core Strategy (2012), policies DM1 and DM7 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013),  the adopted Residential Design Guide Supplementary Planning Document (2010) and the Pinnerwood Park Conservation Area Appraisal and Management Strategy 2008.",
    "Reason : 4 - The proposed development is proposed to be built over and in close proximity to the culvert and an appropriate buffer zone would not be provided. Notwithstanding this, the applicant has not provided any information to demonstrate how the existing culvert would be protected during construction works to ensure it would not be damaged and result in flooding within the application site and elsewhere. The proposed development is therefore contrary to The National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policy SI12 of The London Plan (2021), policy CS.1.U of The Harrow Core Strategy (2012) and policies DM10 and DM11 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013)."
