    "Reason : 1 - The proposed first floor rear extension by reason of its excessive depth, bulk, shallow pitched roof and eaves height, would introduce an incongruous, overly dominant and obtrusive form of development, that would fail to respect the proportions of the existing dwellinghouse, and the character and appearance of the neighbouring properties, to the detriment of the character and appearance of the existing dwellinghouse and the surrounding area, contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D3.D (1) and (11) of The London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed first floor rear extension by reason of its significant rearward projection, eaves height and siting in close proximity to No. 79 Old Church Lane, would appear highly intrusive and overbearing, and would significantly increase the loss of outlook and enclosure, to the detriment of the residential and visual amenities of the occupiers of this neighbouring property, contrary to  the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D3.D (7) of the London Plan (2021), Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and guidance contained in the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010)."
