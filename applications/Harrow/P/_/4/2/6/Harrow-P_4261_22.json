    "Reason : 1 - The proposal, by reason of an unsatisfactory Flood Risk Assessment, fails to demonstrate that the proposed development would result in a net reduction in flood risk, be resistant and resilient to flooding, would not exacerbate the risk of flooding within the site or increase the risk and consequences of flooding elsewhere or provide a dry means of escape for the users of the site, to the potential detriment of the safety of future occupiers of the development and elsewhere in terms of flood risk.  The proposed development would therefore be contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policy SI 12 of The London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1 U of Harrow Core Strategy (2012) policies DM 9 and DM10 of the Harrow Development Management Polices Local Plan (2013)."
