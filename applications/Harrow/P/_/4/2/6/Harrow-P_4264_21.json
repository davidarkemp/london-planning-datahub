    "Reason : 1 - The cubic content of the proposed roof alterations would exceed the cubic content of the original roof space by more than 50 cubic metres and therefore would not be within the tolerances of Schedule 2, Part 1, Class B, B.1 (dii) of The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 as amended.",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposal fails to demonstrate that the proposed rooflights would not protrude more than 0.15 metres beyond the plane of the slope of the original roof when measured from the perpendicular with the external surface of the original roof and therefore would not be within the tolerances of Schedule 2, Part 1, Class C, C.1(b) of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 as amended.",
