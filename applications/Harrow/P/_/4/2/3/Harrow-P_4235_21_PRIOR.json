    "Reason : 1 - Insufficient information exists for the Local Planning Authority to make a determination as to whether the proposal is likely to result in a material increase or a material change in the character of traffic in the vicinity of the site. It therefore does not fall within Paragraph A.2(1)(a) and B(5) (of Schedule 2), Class A, Part 20 of The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 as amended.",
    "Reason : 2 - Insufficient information exists in relation to the siting and quantum of additional refuse storage required to facilitate the development and therefore the Local Planning Authority is unable to make a determination as to whether the proposal would fall within Paragraph A.1(n) (of Schedule 2), Class A, Part 20 of The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 as amended.",
    "Reason : 3 - The extensions would adversely impact upon the amenity of the existing occupants within the existing building at Rowanweald Residential Care Home, in terms of loss of light. The development would therefore fail to meet with Policy D6.D of the London Plan 2021, DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies 2013, the adopted Supplementary Planning Document Residential Design Guide 2010 and National Planning Policy Framework 2021 and would not be within the tolerances of Class A, Part 20, Paragraph A.2(f) of the General Permitted Development Order (2015) as amended.
