    "Reason : 1 - The proposed rear dormer, by reason of its excessive size and its lack of visual containment within the rear roofslope, would fail to respect the scale and proportions of the existing property and would give rise to a bulky and dominant addition, to the detriment of the character and appearance of the existing property and the surrounding area, contrary to the high quality design aspirations of The National Planning Policy Framework (2021), The London Plan (2021), Core Policies CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposal, by reason of insufficient gross internal floor area (GIA) would create a cramped and poor standard of living accommodation for future occupiers to the detriment of their residential amenity, contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies D3 (7) and  D6 of the London Plan (2021), Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013), the adopted Supplementary Planning Document Residential Design Guide (2010), the Mayor of London Housing SPG (2016) and the Technical Housing Standards Nationally Described Space Standards (2015)."
