    "Reason : 1 - The proposed first floor side extension has a lack of separation with the neighbouring dwellinghouse at no. 65, creating a terracing effect that is contrary to, and to the detriment of, the established character and appearance within the immediate street scene, of which the prevailing character is semi-detached properties with clear separation between pairs. The proposed development is therefore contrary to the design aspirations of The National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021), Core Policies CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document Residential Design Guide (2010)."
