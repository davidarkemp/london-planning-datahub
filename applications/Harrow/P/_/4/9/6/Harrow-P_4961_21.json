    "Reason : 1 - The development, by reason of the undersized floorspace of the two storey 2bed/4person flat in conjunction with the lack of internal storage space would result in a poor and cramped standard of living accommodation for future occupiers to the detriment of their residential amenities. As such the development would be contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021), Policies DM 1 and DM 26 of the Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013), The National Housing Standards-Nationally Described Space Standards (2015), The  Mayor of London Housing Supplementary Planning Guidance (2016), and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed part two storey rear extension by reason of its poorly designed stepped roof design and lack of subservience would appear obtrusive and incongruous, and would fail to respect the form, character and appearance of the host building and the surrounding area. The proposal is therefore contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D3 (d11) of the London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1 (B) of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), policy DM 1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).\r\n"
