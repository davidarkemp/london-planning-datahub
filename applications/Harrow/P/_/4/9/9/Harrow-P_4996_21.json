Furthermore, there is an Article 4 Direction. The Article 4 Direction includes all additions and alterations to a building, including the alterations to the roof, dormers with windows or rooflights and the gabling of existing hipped roofs.  Therefore, the proposal cannot be completed under Permitted Development right prescribed under Class B, Part 1 (Schedule 2) of The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended) and planning permission is required for such development.
