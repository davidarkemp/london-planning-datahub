    "Reason : 1 - The proposal, by failing to include the single storey rear extensions to each dwellinghouse within the description of development to which the proposed first floor rear extensions would be constructed on, fails to include the full particulars of the proposed development and would therefore fail to meet the requirements set out under Article 7(1)(b) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015.",
    "Reason : 2 - Notwithstanding reason for refusal no.1, the proposed first floor rear extensions to nos 15, 16, and 17 Little Common, by reason of their excessive internal floor space and volume in conjunction with previously approved enlargements would result in disproportionate additions over and above the size of the original buildings and would therefore constitute an inappropriate development within the Green Belt, to the detriment of the character, appearance, and openness of the Green Belt contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy G2 of The London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1.F of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM16 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013).",
    "Reason : 3 - Notwithstanding reason for refusal no.1, the proposed first floor rear extensions by reason of their poor design, scale roof forms and excessive width in conjunction with previously approved enlargements would be unduly bulky and an incongruous and contrived form of development, which subsumes and erodes the traditional built form of the terraced properties, the pattern of development in the locality and cause harm to the Little Common Conservation Area, contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies D3 (D(1) and D(11)) and HC1.C of The London Plan (2021), Core Policies CS1 (B) and (D) of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), policies DM 1 and DM 7 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013), the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010) and the Little Common Conservation Area Appraisal and Management Strategy (2013)."
