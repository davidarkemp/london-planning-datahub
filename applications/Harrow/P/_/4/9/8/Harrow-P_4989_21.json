    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development would be in connection to an existing building which does not benefit from planning permission and is otherwise considered to be unlawful. As such, the permission granted by Schedule 2 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended) does not apply to the subject building, under Article 3(5) of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "Reason : 2 - Notwithstanding the above, the proposed outbuilding would exceed a maximum height of 2.5 metres (when measured from natural ground level) whilst being sited within 2 metres of the boundary of the curtilage of the dwellinghouse and is therefore not within the limitations of Schedule 2, Part 1 Class E, E.1(e)(ii) of The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 as amended.",
