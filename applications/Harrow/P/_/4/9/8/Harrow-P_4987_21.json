    "Reason : 1 - The proposed two-storey side extension, in conjunction with the proposed two storey rear extension, by reason of their poor design and insufficient set back from the side boundary, would give rise to an unsympathetic, incongruous, and obtrusive form of development which would fail to respect the character, composition, and design of the host dwelling and adversely affect the character of the wider area, contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021),  Policy D3.D(1) and (11) of the London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed single storey rear extension, by reason of its excessive rearward projection and siting, would be detrimental to the amenities of the neighbouring occupiers at No. 53 Blythwood Road, in terms loss of light, outlook and overshadowing, contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D3.D(7) of The London Plan (2021),  Policy DM1 of the Development Management Policies Local Plan document (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010)."
