    "Reason : 1 - The proposal would result in the additional dwellinghouse being sited on a private residential garden. As such, the principle of the development is contrary to the Harrow Core Strategy of directing new residential and other development to the Harrow and Wealdstone Opportunity Area, town centres and, in suburban areas, to strategic previously developed sites and would therefore harm its implementation, contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies CS1.A and CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Garden Land Development (2013).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed development, by reason of its siting and design would give rise to an inappropriate and incongruous form of development in the streetscene that would detract from the character, composition and design of the neighbouring properties, to the detriment of the streetscene, and the established and prevailing pattern of development in the locality contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D3 (D(1) and D(11)) of The London Plan (2021), Policy CS.1B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 of the Development Management Plan Local Policies (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed dwellinghouse, by reason of its siting, height, and proximity to the side boundaries of the site, would result in an overbearing impact for the neighbours at No. 168 Whitchurch Lane, by way of visual intrusion and overshadowing, contrary to Policy D3.D(7) of The London Plan (2021), Policy DM1 of the Development Management Plan Local Policies (2013) and the Adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 4 - The window serving the rear first floor bedroom in the north-eastern rear wall of the proposed dwelling by reason of its orientation, siting and elevated position in relation to the rear site boundary would result in perceived overlooking to the private rear gardens of no.s 162-164 Whitchurch Lane forming an unneighbourly development and failing to respect the established pattern of development and existing relationships between dwellinghouses resulting in a loss of privacy, contrary to Policy D3.D(7) of The London Plan (2021), Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013), and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 5 - The window serving the rear first floor bedroom in the north-eastern rear wall of the proposed dwelling by reason of its orientation and the provision of a privacy screen would fail to provide an adequate means of light and outlook for the occupiers of the host dwellinghouse, contrary to Policies D3.D(7) and D6 of The London Plan (2021), Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013), and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document Residential Design Guide (2010).\r\n"
