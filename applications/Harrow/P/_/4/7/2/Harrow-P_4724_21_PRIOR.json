    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development, by reason of its poor architectural design, would fail to respect the character and appearance of the existing dwelling and its principal elevation and the character and appearance of adjoining dwellings. The development would therefore fail to meet with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies D3.D(1) and D3.D(7) of the London Plan (2021), DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies 2013, Core Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), the adopted Supplementary Planning Document Residential Design Guide 2010, and would not be within the tolerances of Class AA.2 (3)(a)(ii), of Schedule 2, Part 1 of the General Permitted Development Order (2015) as amended.",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed development, by reason of the additional height of the third storey and proposed rear windows alongside the elevated position of the proposed windows, in conjunction with its close proximity to neighbouring boundaries and their amenity spaces would result in loss of privacy, overlooking and loss of outlook to the adjacent neighbouring occupiers, to the detriment of their residential and visual amenities, contrary to policy D3 of the London Plan (2021), policy DM 1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010)."
