    "Reason : 1 - The proposal would introduce a rear dormer extension that would not be wholly contained within the roofslope of the dwelllinghouse and therefore effectively creates a second storey extension that will sit above the dwellinghouse's outrigger. The proposal would therefore also need to be assessed under Class A of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015. As the extension would be within 2 metres of the boundary of the curtilage of the property and result in an eaves height in excess of 3 metres, it would fail to comply with criterion A.1 (i) of Class A of Schedule 2, Part 1 of The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended). Furthermore, the extension would result in an alteration to the roof of the dwellinghouse, with it being linked into, and extending the roof form of the main dwellinghouse contrary to criterion A.1 (k) (iv) of Class A of Schedule 2, Part 1 of The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposal is therefore not a lawful development."
