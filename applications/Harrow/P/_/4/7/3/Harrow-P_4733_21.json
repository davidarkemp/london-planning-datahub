    "Reason : 1 - The proposed front dormer roof extensions, by reason of their combined siting, bulk, massing, excessive width, unsatisfactory design, failure to be adequately set back from the sides and eaves of the front roof slope results in an unsympathetic, incongruous, bulky, unduly dominant and contrived form of development that fails to respect the character, composition and design of the host dwelling and prevailing pattern of development along the street scene. When considered in conjunction to the proposed front roof light and partially retained roof void, the proposed front dormer roof extensions are considered to result in a harmful visual cluttering of the front elevation of the dwellinghouse, detracting from its overall character and appearance, and having an adverse impact on the overall visual amenity afforded along the street scene. The proposal would thereby be contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D3 (1) and (11) of The  London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 A, DM1 B (a), (b) and (c) of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed front canopy together with the existing ground floor front extension would form an unduly prominent, incongruous and unsympathetic addition to the host dwelling and street scene that would excessively alter the host dwelling from its original appearance and have an adverse impact on the overall visual amenity afforded along the street scene. The proposal would thereby be contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D3 (1) and (11) of The  London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 A, DM1 B (a), (b) and (c) of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010)."
