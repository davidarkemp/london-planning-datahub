    "Reason : 2 - The proposed rear dormer, by reason of its excessive size and lack of visual containment within the rear roofslope, would fail to respect the scale and proportions of the existing property and would give rise to a bulky and dominant addition, to the detriment of the character and appearance of the existing dwellinghouse and the surrounding area, contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policy D3 D (11) of London Plan (2021) Core policy CS1.B of The Harrow Core Strategy (2012), policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document Residential Design Guide (2010).\r\n"
