In the absence of a planning application to consider the details and consult the adjoining occupiers, the proposal would therefore  fail to comply with Policies 7.4 B and 7.6 B of The London Plan (2016), policy CS 1 B of the Harrow Core Strategy and policy DM 1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013).\r\n"
