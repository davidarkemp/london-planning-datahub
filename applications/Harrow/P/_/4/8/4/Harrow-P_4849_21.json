    "Reason : 1 - The proposal has not demonstrated that the materials used in the facing side elevations of the rear dormer, when viewed from ground level, would appear to be of a similar colour and design to the materials used in the main roof of the subject dwellinghouse. The proposed development would not therefore be within the tolerances of Schedule 2, Part 1, Class B, B.2 (a) of The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 as amended.",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposal has not demonstrated that the window to be inserted in the wall forming the side elevation of the dwellinghouse would be i) obscure-glazed, and ii) non-opening unless the parts of the window which can be opened are more than 1.7 metres above the floor of the room in which the window is installed. The proposed development would not therefore be within the tolerances of Schedule 2, Part 1, Class B, B.2 (c) of The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 as amended.",
