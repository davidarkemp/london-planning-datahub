    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development  by reason of inappropriate design and scale would result in a bulky and incongruous form of development which would be harmful to the character and appearance of the original dwellinghouse and streetscene failing to adhere to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D3 (D(1) and (11)) of The London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 A, DM1 B (a), (b) and (c) of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed extensions, by reason of scale, resultant height, massing and siting in close proximity to No. 18 Avenue Road would lead to an overbearing impact and loss of light and outlook, and result in overshadowing of the neighbouring property, to the detriment of the residential and visual amenities of the occupiers, contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policy D3. D (7) of the London Plan (2021), policy DM 1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 3 - The site lies in fluvial flood zone 2 & 3 according to Environment Agency flood maps plus within surface water flood zone 3a & 3b according to surface water flood maps. The site is at a highest risk of flooding. The submitted Flood Risk Assessment has not demonstrated that the proposal will provide flood compensation storage for loss of flood plain. As such, the proposal, by reason of its unsatisfactory Flood Risk Assessment has failed to demonstrate that the proposed development would not exacerbate the risk of flooding within the site or increase the risk and consequences of flooding elsewhere, contrary to paragraphs 167 and 168 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policies SI12 of The London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1 U of Harrow Core Strategy (2012) and policy DM 9 of the Harrow Development Management Polices Local Plan (2013)."
