    "Reason : 1 - The proposed first floor side extension, by reason of its lack of subordination would result in a unduly wider dwellinghouse in the streetscene and would give rise to an incongruous and obtrusive form of development, that would detract from the design, character, massing and composition of the host dwellinghouse, to the detriment of the character and appearance of the subject dwelling and the wider street scene, contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D3 (D(1) and D(11)) of The London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010)."
