  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed second floor extension, by reason of its poor design, size, massing, its mid-terrace siting and prominent visibility within the street scene, would form an incongruous, inconspicuous and unsympathetic addition to the host building and street scene. The proposal would thereby be contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policies D3(1) and (11) of The  London Plan (2021), core policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), policy AAP2.A of the Area Action Plan (2013) and policies DM1.A, DM1.B (a) and (c) of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013). \r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - Insufficient information has been submitted on the proposed floor to ceiling heights of the proposed residential units. Therefore, the Local Planning Authority cannot determine whether there would be adequate floor to ceiling height to ensure an acceptable standard of residential accommodation for future occupiers. The proposal is therefore contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policy D6.F(8) of The London Plan (2021), policy AAP4.B of the Area Action Plan (2013), policies DM1.C, DM1.D(g) of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013), the Mayor of London Housing Supplementary Planning Guidance (2016) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed development by reason of the poor layout and poor access arrangements for the proposed residential units by an enclosed alleyway to the rear of the building, with inadequate external lighting and a lack of natural surveillance would create a poor and oppressive form of access for future occupiers of the proposed residential units. The proposal is therefore contrary to the high quality design aspirations of The National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policies D3(D.5), D3(D.10) and D6(B) of The London Plan (2021), policies AAP.4.B of the Area Action Plan (2013), policies DM1.A, DM1.B(g) of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document Residential Design Guide (2010).\r\n",
    "Reason : 4 - It has not been demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority that there would be sufficient, appropriate and accessible space within the curtilage of the site to provide sufficient refuse storage for the proposed commercial and residential uses. As such the proposal would fail to comply with the high quality design aspirations of The National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policy D3.D(4) of The London Plan (2021), policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), policy AAP.4.A(j) of the Area Action Area Plan (2013), policies DM1.B(f) and DM45.A of the Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).\r\n\r\n\r\n",
    "Reason : 5 - The proposed means of access to the proposed residential units would be via an existing alleyway which is subject to flood zone 3a (surface water). The applicant has failed to submit the required flood data (including flood maps - velocity, extent and depth) in relation to emergency planning information and the provision of a safe evacuation route. Therefore, the proposed development is contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policy SI12.(c) of The London Plan (2021), policy CS1.U of The Core Strategy (2012) and policy DM9.A(c) of the Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013)."
