    "Reason : 1 - The proposed part single part two storey front and side extension, and associated front dormer would result in an unduly obtrusive, disproportionate, and incongruous addition to the original dwellinghouse and would unbalance the pair of semi-detached properties that the site forms part of. It would fail to respect the character, and proportions of the dwellinghouse and given its prominent sitting, unsatisfactory design, failure to be set back from the eastern side boundary of the site, would adversely impact upon visually amenity afforded along the street scene. Finally, the proposed extension is considered to excessively alter the dwellinghouse from its original form and appearance. The proposal would thereby be contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D3 (1) and (11) of The  London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 A, DM1 B (a), (c) and (d) of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010)."
