    "Reason : 1 - The proposed two storey side extension by reason of its excessive width, scale and bulk would give rise to a dominant, contrived and incongruous form of development, which would subsume the original dwellinghouse and fail to respect its proportions, scale and character within the street scene. The proposal is therefore contrary to the high quality design aspirations set out in the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D3 (D(1) and D(11)) of The London Plan (2021), policy CS1.B on the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 of the Development Management Local Plans Policies (2013) and adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010)."
