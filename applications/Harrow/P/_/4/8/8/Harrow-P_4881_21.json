    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development by reason of the cumulative impact of the height, roof form and proximity to the side shared boundary with No 5 Hathaway Close and its subsequent bulk and massing would cause harm to the character and appearance of the area and streetscene. As such the proposal would be contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D3.D (1), and D3.D (11) of The London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 2 - The replacement dwelling and associated hardstanding, by reason of its proximity to nearby protected trees, both within their root protection areas and canopy spread would fail to demonstrate that the proposed development preserves the landscape setting of the area and would not risk compromising the amenity value or survival of these trees. As such the proposal would conflict with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021),  Policy G7 of the London Plan (2021), and Policies DM22 and DM23 of the Development Management Policies Plan (2013)."
