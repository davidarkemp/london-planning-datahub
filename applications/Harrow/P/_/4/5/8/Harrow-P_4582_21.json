    "Reason : 1 - The proposed telecommunications mast, by reason of its siting and excessive height and prominent location would be visually obtrusive in the streetscene, to the detriment of the character and appearance of the area, contrary to policies DM1 A and B (a) and DM49 A (b) of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013). ",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed telecoms cabinets, by reason of their quantity, height and siting would result in visual clutter and be visually obtrusive in the streetscene, to the detriment of the character and appearance of the area, contrary to policies DM1 A and B (a) and DM49 A (b) of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013).",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed telecommunications mast and associated equipment cabinets in particular, by reason of their unacceptable siting within the middle of the pavement, directly to the front of the constituency office of the MP for West Harrow would create an area of cover to the front of this office resulting in intensified crime and safety risk. Furthermore, the installation of the associated equipment cabinets would result in a potential increase in antisocial behaviour with it providing areas of rest. The proposed development would thereby be in conflict with Section 17 of the Crime and Disorder Act, and Policy D11 C of The London Plan (2021) and Policy DM2 A. (d) of the Council's Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013)."
