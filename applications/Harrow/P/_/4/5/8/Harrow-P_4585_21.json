  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development by reason of its overall size, scale and massing, would be materially larger than the existing built form at the site, thereby representing an inappropriate form of development which would harm the openness and character of the Green Belt.. As such, the proposal fails to comply with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policy G2 of The London Plan (2021), policy CS1.B and CS1.F of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), and policies DM1 and DM16 of Harrow Development Management Policies (2013).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed first floor and two storey extensions, due to its size, scale, bulk and inappropriate design would be unduly obtrusive, would lack subservience and would be harmful to the character and appearance of the original dwellinghouse and its prevailing design feature. The proposal would significantly harm the character and adversely affect the appearance of the surrounding streetscene and the visual amenity of the Pinner Hill Conservation Area and the Harrow Weald Ridge Area of Special Character. Accordingly, the proposal would be contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policies D3 and HC1 of The London Plan (2021), policies CS1.B, CS1.D, CS1.F and CS6.A of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), policies DM1, DM6 and DM7 of Harrow Development Management Policies (2013), and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document:  Pinner Hill Conservation Area Appraisal and Management Strategy (2009).",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed two storey side extension at the front of the property, by reason of its sideward projection and siting in relation to Meadowview would be an excessively bulky addition, resulting in loss of outlook and give rise to overbearing visual impacts to the detriment of the residential and visual amenities of the occupiers of that neighbouring site, contrary to policy D3.D(7) of The London Plan (2021), policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010)."
