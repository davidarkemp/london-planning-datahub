    "Reason : 1 - The proposal, by reason of its back-land siting, design, poor relationship with neighbouring properties and its habitable function, would fail to provide a suitable setting for the dwelling and represent an inappropriate form of development, at odds with the character of the area and the established prevailing pattern of development in the locality, contrary to policies 7.4B and 7.6B of The London Plan (2016), policies D1 and D3 of The Publication London Plan (2020), policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed development, by reason of the shortfall in the minimum gross internal floor area for the unit and double bedroom respectively, in addition to the absence of an external window serving the second habitable room, and the lack of provision of amenity space for future occupiers would result in a cramped and substandard quality of living accommodation for future occupiers with an inadequate means of light and outlook failing to provide a residential unit of an appropriate design, quality and layout, contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), Policies 3.5 and 7.6 of The London Plan (2016), Policies D3 and D6 of The Publication London Plan (2020), policies DM1, DM26 and DM27 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013), the Mayor of London Supplementary Planning Guidance (2016), and the adopted Residential Design Guide Supplementary Planning Document (2010) and the Technical Housing Standards Nationally Described Space Standards (2015).",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed development, by reason of its orientation and proximity to the shared boundaries with nos.35/37 Charlton Road and 2 Kenmore Road respectively, and its design consisting of glazing in its principal elevation, would form an intrusive and unneighbourly form of development which would cause a perceived or actual loss of privacy to the detriment of the residential amenities of the future occupiers and the occupiers of no. 37 Charlton Road and 2 Kenmore Road. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policy 7.6B of The London Plan (2016), Policy D3 of The Publication London Plan (2020), Core Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010)."
