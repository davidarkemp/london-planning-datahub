    "Reason : 1 - In the absence of robust justification to demonstrate overriding wider public benefit, the proposed redevelopment of the site, by reason of the excessive footprint of the proposed building and encroachment on private rear garden area, would constitute Garden Land Development and represent overdevelopment of the site, and would be at odds with the Councils spatial strategy for growth to the detriment of the character and appearance of the locality, contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Core policies CS1.A and CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Garden Land Development (2013).\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposal, by virtue of its excessive scale and mass, footprint, crown roof and failure to provide a coherent pattern of development in the street scene and at the rear would substantially harm the form, openness and proportion of the site, relationship with the properties in the locality accentuated by its prominent corner siting, poor architectural detailing and dominance of hard surface and visual clutter to the detriment of the character and appearance of the streetscene and the pattern of development within the surrounding area and would therefore be contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies D3.D(1) and D3.D(11) of The London Plan (2021), Policy CS.1B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 of the Development Management Plan Local Policies (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010). \r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed flats by reason of their failure to provide sufficient internal floor space, poor layout (resulting in an inappropriate vertical stacking arrangement), lack of adequate storage and sufficient, meaningful and useable communal amenity space which would give rise to a substandard and poor quality accommodation to the detriment of the residential amenities of the future occupiers of future occupiers of the flats, contrary to policy D6 of The London Plan (2021), policies DM1 and DM26 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013), the Mayor of London Housing Supplementary Planning Guidance (2016) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Documents Residential Design Guide (2010). ",
    "Reason : 4 - By reason of the fact that the site is located within an area of land liable to flooding, and insufficient information has been provided within the submitted Flood Risk Assessment to in relation to; compensatory flood storage, the finished floor level of the dwelling, emergency access/egress plans in the event of flooding, permeable paving details, and drainage strategy details, the applicant has failed to demonstrate that the proposed development would not exacerbate the risk of flooding within the site or increase the risk and consequences of flooding elsewhere. The proposal would thereby be contrary to the to the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), Policy SI 12 C of the London Plan (2021), Policy DM9 A, B and C, DM and DM10 A, C and D of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013)."
