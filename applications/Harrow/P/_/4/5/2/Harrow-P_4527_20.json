    "Reason : 1 - The proposal, by reason of the loss of protected employment floor space which has not been sufficiently justified, and failure to sufficiently justify  the proposed F1 Use Class floorspace, would result in an unacceptable loss of industrial and employment space within the London Borough of Harrow, which would be considered unacceptable in principle. The proposal is therefore considered to be contrary to policies E4 and E7 of The London Plan (2021), policy CS1.O of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), policies DM31 and DM46 of the Harrow Development Management Policies (2013).\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed development, by reason of its scale, massing, bulk, height and building footprint, would result in a development that is cramped within its plot and has a poor and dominating relationship to its surroundings including neighbouring buildings, would be overbearing, bulky and intrusive in relation to its context, and is considered inappropriate for the site and its context. The proposal would therefore be contrary to policies D3D (1) and D4 of The London Plan (2021), policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), The London Plan Housing Supplementary Planning Guidance (2016), policies AAP4, AAP5 and AAP6 of the Harrow & Wealdstone Area Action Plan (2013), policies DM1 and DM2 of Harrow's Development Management Policies Local Plan document (2013), and the Council's adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010). \r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed development fails to demonstrate that up to 60 units can be satisfactorily accommodated on the site to provide adequate levels of daylight and sunlight to the proposed residential units, contrary policies D3D(7) and D6 of The London Plan (2021), policy CS1.K of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), The London Plan Housing Supplementary Planning Guidance (2016), policies AAP4 and AAP13 of the Harrow & Wealdstone Area Action Plan (2013), policy DM1 of Harrow's Development Management Policies Local Plan document (2013), and the Council's adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 4 - The proposal by reason of a failure to adequately demonstrate acceptable levels of daylight and sunlight to neighbouring properties and gardens, would result in an unacceptable degree of overshadowing and/or visual impacts and a heightened sense of enclosure, as well as an unacceptable degree of overlooking and loss of privacy, to the occupiers of the neighbouring properties Kap House, Havilland House, Watson House, nos. 50-52 and 79-81 Glenwood Close, and Ingram House. The proposal is therefore contrary to policy D6 of the London Plan (2021), policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), policy AAP4 of the Harrow & Wealdstone Area Action Plan (2013), policy DM1 of Harrow's Development Management Policies Local Plan document (2013), and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide 2010."
