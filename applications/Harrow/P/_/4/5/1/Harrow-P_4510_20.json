    "Reason : 1 - The proposal, by reason of its massing, scale, siting and poor design, would result in a development which is bulky, overbearing, obtrusive and out of keeping with the pattern of local development, as well as failing to provide a safe and secure environment. The proposal would therefore be contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies D3 (D(1), D(5) and D(11)) and D11 of The London Plan (2021), policy CS.1 of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012) and policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013).\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposal, by reason of its height, bulk, massing, and siting along the common boundaries, would result in a undue impacts on the neighbouring property The Firs, 46 Elm Park Road, in terms of obtrusive overbearing and visual impacts and heightened sense of enclosure on that neighbouring property, as well as loss of light and outlook to the future occupiers of the site comprised of the former nos. 653-659 Uxbridge Road, contrary to policy D3 (D(7)) of The London Plan (2021), policy CS.1 of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012) and policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013). \r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed development, in the absence of an adequate Arboricultural report of the site to assess the impacts of development on the mature protected tree immediately adjacent the proposed development, would be  likely to result in the harm to that protected tree, contrary to policy G7 of The London Plan (2021) and policy DM22 of the Harrow Development Management Policies (2013).\r\n",
    "Reason : 4 - Insufficient information regarding the proposed access and parking arrangements has been provided to allow the local planning authority to fully assess the functionality of the proposed parking. In the absence of such information, the proposal has failed to demonstrate compliance with policies T.6 of The London Plan (2021) and policy DM42 of Harrow�s Development Management Policies Local Plan document (2013).\r\n"
