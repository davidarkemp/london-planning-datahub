    "Reason : 1 - The proposal would result in the additional dwellinghouse being sited on garden land. As such, the principle of the development is contrary to the Harrow Core Strategy of directing new residential and other development to the Harrow and Wealdstone Opportunity Area, town centres and, in suburban areas, to strategic previously developed sites and would therefore harm its implementation, contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies D1.A (3), D3.D (1), and D3.D (11) of the London Plan (2021), Policies CS1.A and CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012) and the Adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Garden Land Development (2013).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed detached dwellinghouse, by reason of its proximity to site boundaries and lack of adequate setting space would introduce a cramped form of development which would interrupt the pattern and grain of development within the existing streetscene. The development therefore fails to meet the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies D3.D (1) and D3.D (11) of the London Plan (2021), Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Polices Local Plan (2013) and the Residential Design Guide Supplementary Planning Document (2010).",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed dwellinghouse, by reason of insufficient gross internal floor area, the siting of front ground floor windows and their proximity to the public footpath, and poorly designed layout of the external private amenity space; would result in a loss of privacy and poor and cramped living conditions for future occupiers, and would therefore be contrary to the  National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies D6.A and D6.F (1) of The London Plan (2021), Policies DM 1 and DM 26 of the Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013), The National Housing Standards-Nationally Described Space Standards (2015), The  Mayor of London Housing Supplementary Planning Guidance (2016),  and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010)."
