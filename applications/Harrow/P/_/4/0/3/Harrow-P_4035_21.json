    "Reason : 1 - The proposed extension on first floor is considered by virtue of its size siting and design to result in an unreasonable degree of impact in terms of bulk, proximity to boundaries, loss of light and overshadowing to no.11 Bellamy Drive. Accordingly, the proposal would be contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D3 D (1) and (11) of the London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposal submitted plans are inaccurate and therefore, the calculations regarding if the total area occupied by the proposed structure and outbuilding were not possible."
