  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposal, by failing to include the single storey front and side extensions and rear dormer within the description of development for which the conversion to two flats relies upon, fails to include the full particulars of the proposed development and would therefore fail to meet the requirements set out under Article 7(1)(b) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015. \r\n\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - Notwithstanding reason for refusal 1, the existing single storey front and side extension and rear dormer are unlawful and therefore cannot be relied on to authorise the conversion of the dwelling to flats The proposed development is therefore contrary to the provision of The Town and Country Planning Act 1990.\r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - Notwithstanding reasons for refusal no.1 and 2, the rear dormer, by reason of its excessive size, bulk and lack of visual containment within the rear roofslope gives rise to a visually obtrusive and overly dominant form of extension to the original property resulting in a detrimental impact on the character and appearance of the existing property. As such, the proposed is contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policy D3 (D(1) and D(11)) of The London Plan (2021), policy CS1.B of The Harrow Core Strategy 2012, Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan 2013 and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document Residential Design Guide 2010.\r\n",
    "Reason : 4 - Notwithstanding reasons for refusal no.1 and 2, the proposed first floor rear terrace by reason of poor design and siting would be a visually obtrusive and overly dominant form of extension to the original property resulting in a detrimental impact on the character and appearance of the existing property and residential amenities of neighbouring properties in terms of loss of privacy and overlooking. As such, the proposed is contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework 2021, policy D3 (D(1), D(7) and D(11)) of The London Plan 2021, policy CS1.B of The Harrow Core Strategy 2012, Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan 2013 and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document Residential Design Guide 2010.\r\n",
    "Reason : 5 - Notwithstanding reasons for refusal no.1 and 2, the proposed introduction of the additional front door to the front elevation of the side addition would fail to provide a coherent pattern of development in the street scene and would harm the form and relationship with the host property and the wider locality, to the detriment of the character and appearance of the streetscene and the pattern of development within the surrounding area and would therefore be contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D3 (D(1) and D(11)) of The London Plan (2021), Policy CS.1B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 of the Development Management Plan Local Policies (2013) and the Adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).\r\n",
    "Reason : 6 - Notwithstanding reasons for refusal no.1 and 2, the proposed layout of the flats would give rise to poor level of living conditions for the future occupiers of the development due to conflicts in vertical stacking. Furthermore, information has not been submitted to demonstrate how noise transference between residential units would be mitigated. Therefore, the proposed development is therefore contrary to the high quality design aspirations of The National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policy D6.A of The London Plan (2021), policy DM1.D(g) of the Development Management Plan Local Policies (2013) and the Supplementary Planning Document - Residential Design Guide 2010..\r\n"
