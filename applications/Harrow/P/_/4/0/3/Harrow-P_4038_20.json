    "Reason : 1 - The proposal has failed to demonstrate that the floor to ceiling height of any additional storey, measured internally, would exceed the lower of 3 metres or the floor to ceiling height, measured internally, of any storey of the principal part of the existing dwellinghouse, and would not therefore be within the tolerances of Class A.A.1(h), of Schedule 2, Part 1 of the General Permitted Development Order (2015) as amended. ",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed development, by reason of its poor architectural design, would fail to respect the character and appearance of the existing dwelling and its principle elevation and the character and appearance of adjoining dwellings. The development would therefore fail to meet with the National Planning Policy Framework 2019, Policies 7.4B and 7.6.B of the London Plan 2016, DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies 2013, the adopted Supplementary Planning Document Residential Design Guide 2010, and would not be within the tolerances of Class A.A.2 (3aii), of Schedule 2, Part 1 of the General Permitted Development Order (2015) as amended.
