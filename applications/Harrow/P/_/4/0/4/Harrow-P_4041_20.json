    "Reason : 1 - The existing extraction flue by reason of its bulk and scale, stark utilitarian appearance and most notably its low and prominent siting to the eastern elevation of the building, appears as an incongruous and unsympathetic addition to the host building, street scene and wider area. The proposed screening would fail to sufficiently reduce the prominence of the extraction flue and would itself appear as a stark, incongruous and unsympathetic addition to the host building, street scene and area in a wider context. The development would therefore by contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies D3.D(1) and D3.D(11) of The London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 A, DM1 B (a), (b) and (c) of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013).",
    "Reason : 2 - The existing extraction flue, by reason of its bulky design, stark appearance and its proximate siting to two of the care home's first floor residential windows located to either side, unduly restricts outlook and visual amenity afforded to these windows when viewed at oblique angles, providing a substandard form of accommodation for occupants of these particular rooms. The proposed screening would fail to address this, and would in fact result in a more significant loss of outlook as it would add to the bulk and massing of the existing structure. The development would thereby be contrary to policy D3 D (7) The London Plan (2021), and policies DM1 C and DM1 D (f) of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013).",
    "Reason : 3 - The existing extraction flue, by reason of its proximate siting in relation to bedrooms within the care home, and its excessive noise emission levels, results in undue noise and disturbance in respect to residential occupants of the building, providing a substandard form of accommodation for occupants. The proposed screening would provide inadequate sound mitigation to overcome the harm. The development would thereby be contrary to policies D3 D (7) and D14 of The London Plan (2021), and policies DM1 C and DM1 D (h) of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013)."
