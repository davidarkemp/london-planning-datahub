    "Reason : 1 - The proposed sunken seating area, by reason of its siting and separation distance away from the main dwellinghouse, would not form an extension or alteration to the main dwellinghouse, and would result in an inappropriate form of development within the Green Belt, to the detriment of the character, appearance and openness of the Green Belt contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), Policies 7.16 of The London Plan (2016), Policy G2 of The Draft London Plan (2019) - Intend to Publish, Core Policy CS1.F of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM16 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013), and no very special circumstances have been demonstrated by the applicant whereby the harm by reason of inappropriateness is outweighed by other considerations.",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed sunken seating area, by reason of its siting to the shared eastern boundary with no.7 Hall Farm Close, and its design consisting of a large amount of glazing in its rear elevation, would form an intrusive form of development which would cause a perceived and actual loss of privacy to the detriment of the residential and visual amenities of no. 7 Hall Farm Close. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policy 7.6B of The London Plan (2016), Policy D3 of The Draft London Plan (2019) - Intend to Publish, Core Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010)."
