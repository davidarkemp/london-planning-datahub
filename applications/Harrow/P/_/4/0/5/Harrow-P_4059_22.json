    "Reason : 1 - The proposed two storey side to rear extension in conjunction with the existing gable and rear dormer roof extensions, and the excessive width of the two storey rear element, by reason of their poor design, excessive bulk and massing, would form an incongruous and discordant addition to the host dwelling and street scene, and would dominate and subsume the proportions of the subject dwelling, and result in a loss of space about the building at first floor level, failing to enhance local context and respond to local distinctiveness, The proposal would thereby be contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies D3.D(1) and D3.D(11) of The London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010)."
