    "Reason : 1 - The proposal fails to demonstrate whether or not the new flank loft floor window would be non-opening where it is not set above 1.7 metres above internal floor level. In the absence of satisfactory information to verify this, the Council cannot assume that this would be the case. The proposed development would thereby be contrary to Condition B.2 (c)(ii) of Class B of Schedule 2, Part 1 of The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "Reason : 2 - The installation of the air conditioning unit would not form permitted development under any part of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended). Class G of Schedule 2, Part 14, of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England)  Order 2015 (as amended) does permit the installation or alteration of air source heat pumps on domestic properties, however this is not applicable for the installation of an air conditioning unit. The installation of the air conditioning unit would not be permissible under Class A of Schedule 2, Part 1, of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England)  Order 2015 (as amended) as it would fail to incorporate external materials similar in appearance to those used in the construction of the exterior of the existing dwelling, contrary to Condition A.3 (a) of Class A of Schedule 2, Part 1 of The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposal is therefore not a lawful development."
