  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed ground floor rear extension together within the existing ground floor side to rear extension and two storey side extension, by reason of their excessive combined width, depth, bulk, footprint and massing would form incongruous, disproportionate and insubordinate additions to the original building, resulting in an overdevelopment of the site, and unduly detracting from the character and appearance of the host building and surrounding area. The external decking area serving Flat 2 to the rear of the ground floor extension, by reason of its tall boundary treatment and siting, would appear visually obtrusive and exacerbate the overall disproportionality of the ground floor extensions, furthermore its cramped shoehorned siting results in this external decking area appearing awkward and contrived in context with the rest of the site and its surroundings. The proposed privacy screens to be sited on the roof of the existing ground floor extension would appear unduly at odds with surrounding built form and development, thereby forming incongruous and unsympathetic additions to the host building and wider area. The proposal would thereby be contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies D3.D(1) and D3.D(11) of the London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 A, DM1 B (a), (b), and (c), DM26 A (g) and DM26 E of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed hip to gable roof extension, together with the proposed rear dormer and existing two storey side extension, by reason of their excessive combined width, bulk, massing, and the resulting stark variation in roof styles between the two storey side extension and main roof, would cumulatively form incongruous, discordant, contrived, unduly bulky and dominant additions to the host building, which would appear unduly at odds with the established pattern of development along the street scene and within the wider area, thereby detracting from the overall level of visual amenity afforded. The proposal would therefore be contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies D3.D(1) and D3.D(11) of The London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 A., DM1 B. (a), (b) and (c), DM26 A (g) and DM26 E of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 3 - The smaller bedroom within Flat 1 would be provided with unsatisfactory levels of natural outlook and ventilation with it not being served by any windows and only a single roof light, Flat 3 is provided with insufficient private amenity space with it not benefiting from any private outdoor amenity space, and with the unit�s internal enclosed balcony failing to be of a sufficient size to make up for this shortfall. Furthermore, in the absence of proposed section drawings detailing the internal head heights of all units, the council cannot be satisfied that units would accord with the minimum overall GIA and internal head height requirements  set out within the London Plan and Nationally Described Space Standards issued by the Department for Communities and Local Government on 27th March 2015. The proposed development would therefore give rise to substandard and poor quality accommodation to the detriment of the residential amenities of the future occupiers of the units contrary to policies D3.D(7), D6.D, D6.F.(1) and (8) of The London Plan (2021), Policies, DM1 C, DM1 D (f) and (g), DM26 A (a), (d), and (e), and DM26 E of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013), the Mayor of London Housing Supplementary Planning Guidance (2016), Department for Communities and Local Government Technical Housing Standards; Nationally Described Space Standards (2015), and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010)."
