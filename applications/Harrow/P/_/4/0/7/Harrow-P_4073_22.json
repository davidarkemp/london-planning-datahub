    "Reason : 1 - The proposal would result in the additional dwellinghouse being sited on garden land. As such, the principle of the development is contrary to the Harrow Core Strategy of directing new residential and other development to the Harrow and Wealdstone Opportunity Area, town centres and, in suburban areas, to strategic previously developed sites and would therefore harm its implementation, contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies CS1.A and CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Garden Land Development (2013).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed three storey side extension, by reason of its excessive bulk, would give rise to a disproportionate addition which would fail to provide a coherent pattern of development in the street scene, and would therefore unduly harm the form, openness and proportion of the site and relationship with the properties in the locality. The proposal would therefore be contrary to the high-quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies D3.D(1) and D3.D(11) of The London Plan (2021), Policy CS.1B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 of the Development Management Plan Local Policies (2013) and the Adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed three storey side extension, by reason of its siting, size and height in relation to the community hall/residential building at Wealdstone Methodist Church, would give rise to overshadowing, loss of light and outlook, and would appear as a visually dominant and bulky form of development for the neighbouring occupiers in the building, and would result in perceived overlooking, to the detriment of the visual and residential amenities of the adjoining occupiers, contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework, policy D3 D (7) of The London Plan (2021),  policy DM1 of the Development Management Local Plan Policies (2013) and adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010)."
