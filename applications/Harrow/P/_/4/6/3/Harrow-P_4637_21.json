    "Condition : 1 - The development hereby permitted shall be begun before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.\nREASON:  To comply with the provisions of Section 91 of the Town & Country Planning Act 1990.",
    "Condition : 2 - The development hereby permitted shall be carried out in accordance with the following approved plans and documents: Site Location Plan; Site Plan; D1; D2; D3; D4; GB1 rev A.\nREASON: For the avoidance of doubt and in the interests of proper planning.\n\n",
    "Condition : 3 - The materials to be used in the construction of the external surfaces of the extension hereby permitted shall match those used in the existing building.\nREASON: To safeguard the character and appearance of the area in accordance with Core Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012) and Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013).\n",
    "Condition : 4 - The window(s) in the flank elevation(s) of the proposed development shall:\n(a) be of purpose-made obscure glass,\n(b) be permanently fixed closed below a height of 1.7m above finished floor level,\nand shall thereafter be retained in that form.\nREASON: To safeguard the residential  amenities of neighbouring residents, in accordance with Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013).\n",
    "Condition : 5 - Notwithstanding the provisions of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (or any order revoking and re-enacting that order with or without modification), no window(s)/door(s), other than those shown on the approved plans shall be installed in the flank elevation(s) of the development hereby permitted without the prior permission in writing of the local planning authority.\n\nREASON: To safeguard the residential  amenities of neighbouring residents, in accordance with Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013).\n",
    "Condition : 6 - The outbuilding hereby permitted shall not be occupied or used at any time as a separate residential unit and shall remain in an incidental use to the host dwellinghouse at No. 71 Dale Avenue, Edgware, HA8 6AB. Any other material change of use would require planning permission.\n \nREASON: To safeguard the amenity of neighbouring residents and the character of the locality in accordance with Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013).",
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed outbuilding at rear by reason of its excessive height, bulk and scale, would result in an unduly bulky, disproportionate and obtrusive form of development which would fail to respond positively to local context, and would harm the character, appearance and the visual amenities of the of the subject and adjoining dwellings. As such, the proposal would be contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policy D3 The London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document Residential Design Guide (2010)."
