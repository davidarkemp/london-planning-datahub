    "Reason : 1 - On the basis of the evidence submitted, the proposal would not be incidental to the use of the property as a dwellinghouse and would therefore amount to a material change of use of the premises from the authorised use as a single family dwellinghouse (Use Class C3), as defined  in the Town and Country Planning (Use Classes) Order 1987, as amended. Furthermore, the proposed use would not be within Use Class B1 as presented, rather it would be a Sui Generis Use. ",
