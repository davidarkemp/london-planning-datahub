  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development due its overall form, size, scale and design would result in a poorly designed and incongruous form of development to the detriment of the character and appearance of the surrounding area. The proposal is therefore contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policies D3.D1 and D3.D11 of The London Plan (2021), core policy CS1 B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), policy DM1.A, DM1.B(a) and (b) of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed development, due to its form, depth, siting and height would be visually overbearing and result in a detrimental impact to the visual and residential amenities of No.121 Eastcote Lane due to a loss of outlook, sunlight and overshadowing. The proposal is therefore contrary to the high quality design aspirations of The National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policy D3.D7 of The London Plan (2021) and policy DM1.C, DM1.D(d)(e) of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed 'studio' flat located within the roofspace, due its insufficient floorspace and insufficient floor-to-ceiling height would result in a cramped form of residential development which  would not provide a satisfactory standard of residential accommodation for future occupiers. The proposed development is therefore contrary to the high quality design aspirations of The National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policies D6(1) and D6(8) of The London Plan (2021), policies DM1.C and DM1.D(g) of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 4 - The proposed flats on the upper levels would not be provided with any private outdoor space and would therefore provide a poor standard of accommodation for future occupiers. The proposed development is therefore contrary to the high quality design aspirations of The National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policy D6(9) of The London Plan (2021), policy DM1.B(d), DM1.C and policy DM1.D(i) and the Supplementary Planning Document - Residential Design Guide 2010.\r\n",
    "Reason : 5 - The proposed layout of the flats would give rise to poor level of living conditions for the future occupiers of the development due to conflicts in vertical stacking. Furthermore, information has not been submitted to demonstrate how noise transference between residential units would be mitigated. Therefore, the proposed development is therefore contrary to the high quality design aspirations of The National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policy D6.A of The London Plan (2021), policy DM1.D(g) and the Supplementary Planning Document - Residential Design Guide 2010.",
    "Reason : 6 - The applicant has failed to demonstrate to the satisfaction of The Local Planning Authority that the proposal would provide suitable housing and a genuine choice for a diverse population. The proposal is therefore contrary to the high quality design aspirations of The National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policy D7 of The London Plan (2021), core policy CS1.I of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), policy DM1.B(g), DM1.D(g) and policy DM2 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document Residential Design Guide (2010)."
