    "Reason : 1 - The proposed side to rear extension, resultant roof form above, and the proposed rear dormers by reason of their combined bulk, scale, massing, lack of visual containment and unsatisfactory design would result in unsympathetic, incongruous and bulky form of development that fails to respect the character, composition and design of the host dwelling and the character and appearance of the surrounding area, contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D3 (D(1) and D(11)) of The London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1 (B) of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), policy DM 1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed single storey rear extension, by reason of its excessive bulk, scale and depth would result in a disproportionate addition to the original property and would represent a form of development on the site that is out of character with the prevailing pattern of development in the area, to the detriment of the character and appearance of the subject dwellinghouse and prevailing character and appearance of the locality. Furthermore, the excessive height and built would have an unaccepted impact on the amenity of No.4 Park Drive in terms of outlook and overshadowing, contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policy D3 (D7) of The London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1  of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposal by reason of its overall footprint and disproportionate additions to the host dwelling, results in a development being sited on garden land. As such, the principle of the development is contrary to the Harrow Core Strategy of directing new residential and other development to the Harrow and Wealdstone Opportunity Area, town centres and, in suburban areas, to strategic previously developed sites and would therefore harm its implementation, contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies CS1.A and CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Garden Land Development (2013)."
