    "Reason : 1 - The proposed three storey building, by reason of its height, bulk and roof form and its excessive depth, and by reason of the proposed ground, first and second floor balconies fronting High Road and Whitefriars Drive, would introduce an incongruous and obtrusive form of development which would fail to respect the character, massing, form and composition of the neighbouring properties and surrounding area, and would give rise to overdevelopment of the subject site. The proposal would therefore fail to meet with the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), and conflict with Policies D1 (1) and D1 (11), of the London Plan (2021), Policy CS1.B of the Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 of the Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013), and the Harrow Adopted Supplementary Design Guide SPD (2010).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposal, by reason of the height and siting of the three storey building and its relationship with the neighbour at No 199 High Road, and by reason of the height and siting of the proposed brick wall along this shared boundary with No 199 High Road, would result in an overbearing impact and loss of outlook to the occupiers of No 199 High Road, and a sense of enclosure and loss of outlook for the occupiers of the proposed Flat 1, contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies D6.B and D6D of The London Plan (2021), Policy DM1, of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013), the Mayor of London's Housing Supplementary Planning Guidance (2016) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposal, by reason of the siting of ground, first and second floor balconies and windows on the side and rear elevations facing the shared external amenity space and rear access, would result in a loss of privacy for occupiers of the Flats at No 199 High Road, a loss of privacy for occupiers of 2a Whitefriars Drive, and a loss of privacy for future occupiers of Flats 1 and 2, to the detriment of residential amenity of these occupiers and contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies D6.B and D6D of The London Plan (2021), Policy DM1, of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013), the Mayor of London's Housing Supplementary Planning Guidance (2016) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 4 - The proposal, by reason of the siting of ground floor terraces and windows and the use of obscure glazing fronting the High Road and Whitefriars Drive, and poor stacking arrangement between ground and first floor flats, would result in a loss of outlook for the occupiers of Flats 1 and 2, and poor quality of living accommodation to the occupiers of the ground and first floor flats, to the detriment of their residential amenity, contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies D6.B and D6D of The London Plan (2021), Policy DM1, of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013), and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 5 - The Council has not been able to comprehensively assess the heritage impact or otherwise of the proposal on the Grade II Listed St Joseph's Catholic Church, by reason of the absence of a heritage statement identifying the impact of the proposal on this setting. The proposal is therefore contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), and cannot be assessed accurately with regard to the framework or to Policies D3.D (11) and HC1 of The London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1.B and D of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policies DM1 and DM7 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the guidance contained in the Historic England Good Practice Advice in Planning Note 3: The setting of heritage assets.
