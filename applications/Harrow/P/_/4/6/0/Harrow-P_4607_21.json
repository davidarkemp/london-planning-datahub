  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed physiotherapy use, by reason of the high number of staff to be employed, the long operation hours, its excessive internal floor space, its formal commercial internal configuration, and the fact that it would have entirely separate access from the residential accommodation, would result in an undue intensification of the host building, with the use failing to be ancillary to that of the main dwelling, thereby being incompatible with site's suburban residential setting. Insufficient information has been provided to demonstrate that the proposed physiotherapy clinic would form a community use that specifically serves local residents within the area. The principle of the development is contrary to the Harrow Core Strategy which sets out that proposals that would harm the character of suburban areas will be resisted. The proposal would thereby be contrary of National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012) and Policies DM33 A and DM46 B (a) and E of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed ground floor side extension together with the new car parking area to the front would result in the physiotherapy clinic being sited on garden land. In light of the above, the principle of the development is contrary to the Harrow Core Strategy which sets out that garden land development will be resisted, and aims to direct new commercial development to the Harrow and Wealdstone Opportunity Area, town centres and to previously developed sites within suburban areas. The proposal would thereby be contrary of National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies CS1.A and CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Garden Land Development (2013).",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed double sided hip to gable and rear dormer roof extensions, by reason of their excessive combined bulk, massing and unsatisfactory design result in an unsympathetic, incongruous, bulky and contrived form of development that fails to respect the character, composition and design of the host building and prevailing pattern of development in within the area. Furthermore, the proposed ground floor side extension, by reason of its excessive width, unduly bulky roof form and uncharacteristic incorporation of a second front entrance door to the front elevation of the building would form an unsympathetic, incongruous, disproportionate, and insubordinate addition to the host building, adversely impacting on its character and appearance, and the overall visual amenity afforded along the street scene. The proposal would thereby be contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies D3.D(1) and D3.D(11) of The London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 A, DM1 B (a), (b) and (c) of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 4 - The proposed car park would introduce an unduly expansive area of hardsurfacing to the front of the site fully subsuming the front forecourt of the existing dwellinghouse and a large part of the garden which sits beside this, resulting in an undue loss of soft landscaping and shrubbery to the existing front forecourt and adjacent garden area which would effectively form an enlarged part of the new front forecourt. The development would therefore have an adverse impact on the overall  visually amenity afforded along the street scene, and would thereby be contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Core Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policies DM1 B (e), DM22 B and DM23 C of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013), in addition to the guidance provided within the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 5 - The proposed ground floor level extensions, together with the new car park to the front of the site would result in an undue loss of outdoor amenity space serving the site's residential occupants, with the resulting space being minimal in its overall size, and being impractical and dysfunctional in its layout. The proposal would thereby be contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D3.D(7) of the London Plan (2021), Policies DM1 B (d) and DM27 C of the of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013), in addition to the guidance provided within the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010)."
