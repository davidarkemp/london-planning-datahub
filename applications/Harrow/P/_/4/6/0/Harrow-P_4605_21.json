  "description": "Root severance to T1 (Fir) , T2 (Fir) , T3 (Wellingtonia) to install a root barrier to the front of No 17 & 18 Canons Drive. The works are proposed to stop the influence of the tree(s) on the soil below building foundation level and provide long term stability. Estimated costs of repair to the building are ?160,000.000 if the influence of the tree(s) remain. In the event of a refusal we, or our clients, will seek to secure compensation for the additional costs incurred through Section 202(e). It is the expert opinion of both the case engineer and arboriculturalist that on the balance of probabilities the supporting information demonstrates the influence of the tree(s).",
