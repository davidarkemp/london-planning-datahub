    "Reason : 1 - The proposed single storey side extension by reason of prominent siting and additional bulk, would appear obtrusive and out of character with the established pattern of development in the street scene and would detract from the spatial setting of the existing and surrounding dwellings on this prominent corner to the detriment of character of the locality and visual amenity contrary to the high quality design aspirations set out in the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policies D3.D(1) and D3.D(11) of The London Plan (2021), policy CS1.B on the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), policy DM1 of the Development Management Local Plans Policies (2013) and adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 2 - In the absence of a arboricultural impact assessment or an appropriate mitigation strategy, the proposed development would be likely to prejudice the survival and integrity of the protected trees on the site, which contributes significantly to the visual amenity and landscape value and consequently would be detrimental to the character and appearance of the area. The proposal would therefore be contrary to the high quality design aspirations set out in the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policy G7(C)  of The London Plan (2021) and policies DM1 and DM22 of the Development Management Local Plans Policies (2013)."
