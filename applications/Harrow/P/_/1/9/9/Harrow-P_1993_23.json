    "Reason : 1 - The proposal has not been accompanied by evidence that the required noticed have been served to other parties with a legal interest in the site. In addition, the proposal appears to encroach on neighbouring properties, and while insufficient information has been submitted for the Local Planning Authority to determine the siting of the proposal in relation to neighbouring boundaries with 462 Eastcote Lane, or for the Local Planning Authority to fully and accurately assess the impacts of the proposed development on this adjoining property. Therefore, the submitted documents fail to accurately and clearly describe the development applied for and failed to serve the appropriate notice on all landowners. The application would consequently fail to meet the provisions of sub-sections 7 and 13, Part 3 of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015.",
    "Reason : 2 - Insufficient information has been provided for the Local Planning Authority to ensure that the proposal would not result in undue noise impacts on the adjoining properties no. 460a Eastcote Lane. Thus, the proposal has failed to demonstrate compliance with policy D14 of the London Plan (2021) and policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013). \r\n"
