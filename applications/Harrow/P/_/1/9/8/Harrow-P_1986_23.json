    "Reason : 1 - The proposed first-floor side extension by reason of its flank wall not being parallel with the flank wall of the dwellinghouse, would result in an overly dominant and contrive form of development that would be unduly obtrusive and incongruous and would detract from the appearance of the subject property and adjacent properties, to the detriment of the character and appearance of the subject property and the surrounding area, and the prevailing pattern of development in the area, contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023), Policy D3.D.1 and D.11 of The London Plan (2021), Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 of the Development Management Plan Local Policies (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010)."
