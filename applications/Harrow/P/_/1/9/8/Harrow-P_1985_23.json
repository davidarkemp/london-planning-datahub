    "Reason : 1 - The proposal by reason of the cumulative bulk, massing and the side extension's failure to retain a gap with the adjoining detached property No 20 Royston Park Road would subsume the original character of the property resulting in  an incongruous, discordant, unduly bulky and dominant addition to the host dwelling and would adversely affect the overall detached character and appearance of the host dwelling and its contribution to the wider street scene, and would detract from the established pattern of development within the immediate area. The proposal would thereby be contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023), Policies D3.D(1) and D3.D(11) of The London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 A., DM1 B. (a), (b) and (c) of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010)\r\n"
