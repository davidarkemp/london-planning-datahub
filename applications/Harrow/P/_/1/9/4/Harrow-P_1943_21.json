    "Reason : 1 - The proposed two storey side extension and rear dormer by reason of their prominent siting at the corner of High View and Ashdene, and excessive combined width, bulk, massing and lack of appropriate set ins, would result in incongruous, insubordinate, contrived, unduly bulky and dominant additions to the host dwelling and street scene, excessively altering the host dwelling from its original form detracting from the character and appearance of the host property and the surrounding area. The proposal would thereby be contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), Policy D3 D(1) and D(11) of The London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 A., DM1 B. (a) and (b) of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed glazed mural to the front elevation of the dwellinghouse, by reason of its excessive size, prominent siting and failure to correspond with architectural features of the existing dwellinghouse and surrounding dwellinghouses within the area would result in a development which would appear discordant and unsympathetic and would fail to accord with the prevailing pattern of development. The proposal would thereby be contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), Policy D3 D(1) and D(11) of The  London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 A., DM1 B. (a) and (b) of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 3 - The new paving in place of the front lawn, by reason of the excessive hardstanding within the front garden, would cause material harm to the character and appearance of the locality resulting in a frontage dominated by hardstanding. The proposal would thereby be contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), Policy D3 D(1) and D(11) of The  London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 A.
