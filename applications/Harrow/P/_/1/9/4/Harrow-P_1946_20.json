    "Reason : 1 - The proposal, by reason of inappropriate materials would fail to match the existing property or represent high quality design. It would therefore fail to maintain or enhance the character and appearance of the host property or the surrounding street scene and fail to represent high quality design. Accordingly, the proposal is contrary to Policies 7.4 of the London Plan 2016, DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies 2013, the adopted Supplementary Planning Document Residential Design Guide 2010 and section 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2019."
