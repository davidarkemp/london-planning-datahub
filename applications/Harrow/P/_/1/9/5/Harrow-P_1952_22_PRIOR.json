    "Reason : 1 - The proposal, by reason of its rearward projection and siting, would be detrimental to the amenities of the neighbouring occupiers at No. 74A Grant Road, contrary to Policy DM1 of the Development Management Policies Local Plan document (2013) and the relevant provisions of the adopted Harrow Supplementary Planning Document Residential Design Guide (2010).\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The total enlargement would extend beyond a wall forming a side elevation of the original dwellinghouse and would have a width greater than half the width of the original dwellinghouse. Therefore, the development has failed to comply with the relevant conditions required for the proposed development and is contrary to Schedule 2, Part 1, Class A (j) (iii) of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).\r\n"
