    "Reason : 1 - The roof form of the proposed two side extension and proposed two storey storey rear extension, by reason of their poor roof design and different roof pitch angles to the original roof, would give rise to an contrived and incongruous form of development which would fail to respect the original roof form of the original dwellinghouse. The proposal would thereby be contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D3.D(1) and D3.D(11) of The London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 B. (a) and (b) of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed single storey rear extension, by reason of its excessive depth and siting in relation to No.2 Furness Road, would result in an unacceptable loss of outlook to No.2 Furness Road, to the detriment of the residential and visual amenities of the neighbouring occupiers at No. 2 Furness Road, contrary to policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010)."
