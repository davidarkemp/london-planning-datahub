    "Reason : 1 - The fire strategy provided within the applicant's Covering Letter (Dated 24/05/2022) and further detail provided within the accompanying floor plan drawing (Drawing No. 366-EXT-01) fail to provide sufficient information for the discharge of condition 6 (Fire Safety Statement). The applicant has failed to provide information on how the development is designed to incorporate appropriate features which reduce the risk to life and the risk to injury in the event of a fire, they have failed to provide details to indicate that the development would be constructed in an appropriate way to minimise the risk of fire spread, they have failed to provide sufficient details on means of escape and an associated evacuation strategy for all building users, they have failed to develop a robust management strategy for evacuation, finally, they have failed to indicate how the development would provide suitable access and equipment for firefighting, appropriate to the size and use of the development. In the absence of satisfactory information, the council cannot be satisfied that the development would be appropriately safe in the event of a fire, contrary to Policy D12(a) of The London Plan (2021).\r\n"
