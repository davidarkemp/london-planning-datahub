    "Reason : 1 - The proposed playhouse by reason of its location and siting in close proximity to the boundary of the neighbouring dwelling and its design, would create an incongruous feature which would appear unduly bulky, obtrusive and unsympathetic when viewed from the neighbouring garden at No. 10 Canons Close, HA8 7QR, and would result in loss of privacy and perceived overlooking of the neighbouring residents, to the detriment of the visual and residential amenities of these neighbouring occupiers, contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2023), Policies D3.D(7) and D3.D(11) of The London Plan (2021), Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 of the Development Management Plan Local Policies (2013) and the Adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010)."
