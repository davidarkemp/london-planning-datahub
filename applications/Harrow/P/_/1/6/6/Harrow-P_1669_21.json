    "Reason : 1 - The proposed outbuilding, by reason of its siting, excessive height, bulk and scale, in conjunction with the existing sheds would result in an unduly bulky, disproportionate, dominant and obtrusive form of development which would fail to respect the prevailing pattern of the development in the locality, to the detriment of the character and appearance of the area and visual amenities of the adjoining occupiers at No. 15 and 19 Thistlecroft Gardens, contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policy D3 of The London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document Residential Design Guide (2010)."
