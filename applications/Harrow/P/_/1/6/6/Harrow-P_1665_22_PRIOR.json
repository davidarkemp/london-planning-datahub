    "Reason : 1 - The proposed demolition of the existing conservatory constitutes development within the meaning of Section 55 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended) and therefore requires planning permission and would fall outside of the tolerances set out by Part 1, Schedule 2 Class A.1(g) of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development (England) Order 2015, as amended.",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed enlargement would extend beyond a wall forming a side elevation in the form of a bay feature of the original dwellinghouse and would have a width greater than half of the width of the original dwellinghouse. As such, the proposal would not comply with limitation A.1(j)(iii) and A.1(ja) of Class A of Part 1 (of Schedule 2) of The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015, as amended.",
    "Reason : 3 - By way of the proposed enlargement extending beyond the original recessed wall, the proposed single storey rear extension would extend beyond the limits of 8 metres. As such, the proposal would not comply with Part 1 Schedule 2 Class A.1 (g)(i) of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development (England) Order 2015, as amended.\r\n"
