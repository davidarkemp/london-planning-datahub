    "Reason : 1 - The proposed canopy structure, associated timber screening and planters by reason of their design, scale and siting within the forecourt, would result in a harmful impact on the character and appearance of the host building and the locality and would detract from the prevailing pattern of development within the immediate area. The proposal would therefore contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policy D3.D.11 of the London Plan (2021), policy CS1B. of the of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed outdoor seating by reason of its use and hours of operation would potentially give rise to unreasonable levels of noise disturbance for  occupiers of the upper floors residential units of the host building and adjoining residential units, contrary to policies D3.D.7, D13 and D14 of The London Plan (2021) and policies DM1 and DM38 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan 2013."
