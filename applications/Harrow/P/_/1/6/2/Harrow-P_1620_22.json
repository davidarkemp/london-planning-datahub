    "Reason : 1 - The proposed first floor side to rear extension by reason of its bulk and siting within close proximity to the boundary with no. 56 Pangbourne Drive would give rise to a unduly bulky and visually intrusive form of development when viewed from the rear of the neighbouring property and would give rise to a loss of light and overshadowing, to the detriment of the residential amenities of the occupiers of no. 56 Pangbourne Drive, contrary  to Policy D3 (7) of The London Plan (2021), policy DM 1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed single storey rear extension, by reason of its siting and excessive rearward projection, would be unduly obtrusive and would result in a loss of outlook and give rise to overshadowing to the  detriment  of the visual and residential amenities of the occupiers of the adjacent property no. 56 Pangbourne Drive, contrary to Policy D3 (7) of the London Plan (2021), Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and guidance contained in the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010)",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed front extension incorporating a front porch, by reason of its excessive depth and siting where it extends substantially beyond the front bay window, results in a bulky and incongruous addition which dominates the front elevation of the property, and which fails to reflect the form and character of the street scene, contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D3 (D(1) and D(11)) of the London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1 (B) of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), policy DM 1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010)."
