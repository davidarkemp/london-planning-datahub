    "Reason : 1 - The proposed rear extensions together with the proposed roof alterations and ungainly crown roof detail cumulatively by reason of their excessive combined bulk, massing, unsatisfactory design, and poor assimilation with the original roof form results in an unsympathetic, incongruous, bulky, and contrived form of development that the fails to respect the character, composition and design of the host dwelling, excessively altering the dwellinghouse from its original form, and adversely impacting on the overall visual amenity afforded along the street scene. The proposal would thereby be contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D3.D(1) and D3.D(11) of The London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 A, DM1 B (a), (b) and (c) of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010)."
