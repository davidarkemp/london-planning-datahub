    "Reason : 1 - The proposed first floor side extension by reason of its excessive size, bulk and width would be an unduly obtrusive form of development that would give rise to a disproportionate addition to the host dwelling and would detract from the character and appearance of the existing property. The proposal would therefore fail to preserve or enhance the character and appearance of the existing dwellinghouse and the Mount Park Estate Conservation Area, being contrary to the high quality design aspirations set out in the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), policies D3.D(1) and D3.D(11) and HC1 of The London Plan (2021) and DM1 and DM7 of the Harrow Development Plan (2013), the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010), and the provisions of The Harrow on the Hill Conservation Areas SPD: Appendix 4(f) Mount Park Estate Appraisal and Management Strategy (2008).\r\n"
