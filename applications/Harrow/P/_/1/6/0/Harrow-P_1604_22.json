    "Reason : 1 - The proposal, by reason of the increases in scale, mass, bulk, and volume to the dwellinghouse, would constitute inappropriate development in the Green Belt and would have a harmful impact on the openness and visual amenities of the Green Belt. The applicant has failed to satisfactorily demonstrate that very special circumstances exist to justify inappropriate development and that the harm, by reason of inappropriateness and any other harm, is clearly outweighed by other considerations. The development is therefore contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy G2 of the\r\nLondon Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1(F) of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012) and Policy DM16 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013). ",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed two-storey extensions and roof alterations by reason of the enlarged roof form, cumulative bulk, mass and scale would fail to provide subordinate and harmonious additions to the host dwellinghouse which would result in overly dominant, obtrusive, and incongruous form of development that serves to erode and subsume the character of the\r\noriginal and existing dwellinghouse, forming a significantly stark contrast to the low character of the adjacent bungalows, contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D3.D(1) and (11) of the London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted\r\nSupplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010)."
