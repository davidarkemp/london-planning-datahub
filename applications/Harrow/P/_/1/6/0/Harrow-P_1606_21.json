    "Reason : 1 - The proposal is unacceptable by reason of the harm that the alterations cause, and would cause, to the special interest of this remarkably intact early 16th century grade II listed timber framed building. In the absence of public benefits to outweigh the harm identified, nor any clear and convincing justification, the proposal conflicts with Section 16 (2) of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990; National Planning Policy Framework (March 2021) paragraphs 194, 195, 197, 199, 200, 202 and 205; the London Plan policy HC1 C (2021); Development Management Local Plan Policy DM7 part A, B, E (May 2013), the Harrow Core Strategy policy CS1 part D, and the guidance contained within: the Planning Practice Guidance for Conserving and Enhancing the Historic Environment (published 10/04/2014 and updated 23/07/2019); the Historic England Advice Note 2: 'Making Changes to Heritage Assets' (adopted 25th February 2016); and Historic England's 'Managing Significance in Decision-Taking in the Historic Environment Historic Environment Good Practice Advice in Planning: 2' (published March 2015) as well as the Department of Culture Media and Sport publication (November 2018) entitled: 'Principles of Selection'.
