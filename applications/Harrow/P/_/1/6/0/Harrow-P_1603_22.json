    "Reason : 1 - The proposed single storey front extension, by reason of its excessive forward projection and unsympathetic design in conjunction with the other proposed enlargements to the dwelling, would result in a bulky and incongruous addition which detracts from the front elevation of the property, and fails to reflect the building line and character of the street scene, contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D3.D(1) and D(11) of the London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1 (B) of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), policy DM 1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010)."
