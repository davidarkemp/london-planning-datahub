    "Reason : 1 - Insufficient information has been submitted in relation to impact of the proposed development on the piped watercourse and in relation to the compensatory flood storage.  In the absence of such details, the local planning authority cannot be satisfied that the development would secure appropriate mitigation against flooding on site and elsewhere and that the proposed structure would not impact upon the structural integrity of the piped watercourse in terms of structural loading. The proposed development would therefore be contrary to  policy SI 12 (C) of The London Plan (2021) and policies DM9 and DM11 of the Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013)."
