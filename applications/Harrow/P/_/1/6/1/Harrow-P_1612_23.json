    "Reason : 1 - The proposed two storey side extension, by reason of its incompatible roof design with the original built form of the dwellinghouse, iits overall scale and bulk, would form a dominant, inappropriate and incongruous form of development, which would subsume the original dwellinghouse and fail to respect its proportions, built form, character and appearance of the host and adjacent dwellings, detracting from their visual amenity, the streetscene and the surrounding area, contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D3.D(1) and D3.D(11) of The London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013), and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document Residential Design Guide (2010)."
