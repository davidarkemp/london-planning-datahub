  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development, due to excessive scale, poor siting and positioning in relation to the existing building ('The Heights') would result in an incongruous addition that would constitute overdevelopment of the site and represent an over-intensification of residential development on the site. The development would, therefore, not represent an appropriate high quality of design, would not maintain or enhance the character of the surrounding streetscene and the visual interests of its surroundings and fails to appropriately respect and relate to its spacious context, contrary to section 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policy D3 (D(1) and D(11)) of The London Plan (2021) and policies AAP1, AAP4, AAP5 and AAP13 of the Harrow and Wealdstone Area Action Plan (2013) and policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Document (2013). ",
    "Reason : 2 - The applicant has failed to provide a financial viability assessment and supporting information to demonstrate that the maximum reasonable level of affordable housing on the development site is provided. In the absence of this information, the proposed development therefore fails to address strategic housing objectives including the provision of mixed, balanced and sustainable communities, contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policies H4 and H6 of The London Plan (2021) and core policies CS1(I) and CS1(J) of The Harrow Core Strategy (2012).",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed development, due to its failure to provide outside communal amenity space and a sufficient quantum and quality of internal communal space for the shared living occupiers, as well as insufficient information to demonstrate the adequate usability, function and quality of the outdoor communal garden for the residential occupiers (of 'The Heights') and insufficient implementation of 'Secured by Design' principles would fail to provide an acceptable standard of accommodation for future occupants and would fail to achieve the aspirations in the creation of inclusive, lifetime neighbourhoods, contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policies H16, D4, D5 and D11 of The Local Plan (2021) and policies DM1, DM2 and DM22 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013). ",
    "Reason : 4 - The submitted Daylight and Sunlight Report, in the absence of accurately assessing the existing site constraints pertaining to the future residents of 'The Heights' directly to the rear of the proposed development would fail to provide sufficient information to assess whether the proposal would result in an acceptable quality of accommodation for future residents with regard to natural light, daylight and overshadowing. The proposed development is therefore contrary to the high quality design aspirations of The National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policy D3(D(7)) and D6(D) of The London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1 of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), and policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013).",
    "Reason : 5 - The proposed development by virtue of its limited availability of space within the site would fail to demonstrate that opportunities for the provision of an additional seven per cent of dwellings could be provided with one designated disabled persons parking space in the future should the existing provision be insufficient. Furthermore, the proposal fails to demonstrate that the proposed delivery and servicing arrangements would not cause adverse impact to safety and traffic flow or conflict with users of the basement car park. The proposal would therefore give rise to an unsustainable development which would fail to contribute towards climate change mitigation as well as cause detrimental harm to the safety and traffic flow of future occupiers and the existing highway network, contrary to Chapter 9 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policies T6, T6.1 and T7 of The London Plan (2021) and policies DM42 and DM44 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013).",
    "Reason : 6 - The proposed development, in the absence of sufficient information within the provided Preliminary Ecological Assessment to demonstrate that the proposal would appropriately secure net biodiversity gain and provide opportunities for local biodiversity mitigation or enhancement within the site or vicinity of the site and substantial shortfall of the recommended urban greening factor as set out in The London Plan, would fail to accord with the aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policies G5 A and B & G6 D of The London Plan (2021), policy CS 1 E of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012) and policies DM20 and DM21 of the Harrow Development Management Polices Local Plan (2013)."
