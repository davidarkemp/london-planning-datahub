    "Reason : 1 - The proposed two-storey rear extension, by reason of its excessive rear projection, width, bulk, scale, massing would fail to provide proportionate, balanced, subordinate and harmonious addition to the host dwellinghouse which serve to introduce an overly dominant, obtrusive and incongruous form of development that subsumes the rear elevation of the host dwellinghouse and fails to respect the scale, character and appearance of the surrounding properties, the development is therefore detrimental to the character and appearance of the existing dwellinghouse and the adjacent dwellings, and the established and prevailing pattern of development in the locality contrary to policy D3 of the London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed two storey rear extensions by reason of its siting, excessive depth and projection beyond the first floor habitable room window of the adjoining property at no. 72 Winchester Road, would result in a large physical presence and cause a harmful impact on the amenities of the adjoining property in terms of loss of outlook, light and an increased sense of enclosure. As such, the proposed development would be contrary to Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and guidance contained in the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010)."
