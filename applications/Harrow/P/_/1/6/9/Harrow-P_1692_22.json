    "Reason : 1 - he  first floor side to rear extension, by reason of its poor and incompatible design, excessive width, and contrived roof design in conjunction with the existing hip-to-gable end enlargement and rear dormer would introduce bulky, incongruous and disproportionate additions of overall poor incohesive design that would serve to subsume the front and rear elevations of the existing dwellinghouse and the scale, character and appearance of the neighbouring properties, the development is therefore detrimental to the character and appearance of the existing dwellinghouse and the adjacent dwelling, contrary to The National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D3.D(1) of The London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document Residential Design Guide (2010)."
