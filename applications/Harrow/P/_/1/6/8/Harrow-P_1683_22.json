    "Reason : 1 - The proposed rear dormer, roof alterations and first floor side extension, by reason of their inappropriate, unsympathetic and unduly large, dominant and bulky design, would introduce a visually obtrusive, and incongruous form of development that would fail to respect the character and appearance of the subject dwellinghouse and the locality, contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D3 D (1) (11) and (12) of the London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1 (B) of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), policy DM 1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed additional flat, by reason of the failure to demonstrate appropriate floor to ceiling height and suitable  bin storage and cycle storage facilities, would give rise to poor quality living conditions for the future occupiers of the proposed self-contained flat, would fail to promote sustainable transport and would be detrimental to the residential amenities of the existing occupiers, contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D3 (2), (4), (7), D6 (A) and T5 A (2) of The London Plan (2021) Policy DM1 (A), (Bf) (C) (Dg), DM42 (c) and (F) and DM45, of the Harrow Development Management Plan Local Policies (2013) and the Adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed roof alterations and first floor side extension, by reasons of their excessive scale, bulk, poor design and siting in relation to neighbouring properties in Harkett Close, would be visually harmful and overbearing and the proposed flank wall windows, by reason of their  habitable use, siting and elevated height, would give rise to perceived overlooking to the adjacent neighbouring dwellings Nos 1 to 3 Harkett Close, to the detriment of the residential and visual amenities of the adjacent neighbouring occupiers, contrary to Policy D3 D (7) of the London Plan (2021), policy DM 1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010)."
