    "Reason : 1 - Within the context of the planning permission P/1234/18 granted on 27.06.2018, the proposed amendment to re-configure the car park layout would result in the substantial reduction in the amount of useable and meaningful communal garden space for future occupiers, and would result in more than half the site being dominated by hard surface which would be inconsistent with the general pattern of development in the surrounding area. The proposal would therefore result in  insufficient communal garden space to the detriment of future occupiers of the site and would detract from the character, appearance and visual amenities of the site and wider surrounding area, contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), policies 3.5, 3.6  and 7.2 of The London Plan (2016), policies D1, D5 and G5 of The Draft London Plan (2019), policy CS1 of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), policy DM1and DM22 of the Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the Council's adopted Residential Design Guide SPD (2010); Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013)."
