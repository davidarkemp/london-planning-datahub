    "Reason : 1 - The proposed two storey rear extension, in conjunction with the gable end and large rear dormer roof extensions, would introduce an incongruous, overly dominant and obtrusive form of development that would fail to respect the form and proportions of the existing dwellinghouse, and the character and appearance of the neighbouring properties, to the detriment of the character and appearance of the existing dwellinghouse and the surrounding area, contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023), Policy D3.D (1) and (11) of The London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposal, by reason of the poor and cramped layout of the ground and first floor flats , poor outlook to living spaces for each flat and the failure to demonstrate adequate internal head height for the proposed first floor flat, would result in a poor standard of living accommodation for future occupiers of those flats, to the detriment of their residential amenities,  contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2023), Policies D6 and D3, D.7 and D.10 of the London Plan (2021), Policies DM 1 and DM 26 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013), The  Mayor of London Housing Supplementary Planning Guidance (2016), the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010) and Housing Design Standards LPG (2023).",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed two storey rear extension, by reason of its excessive depth, would result in a loss of outlook and overbearing impact to the first floor rear windows at No. 14 Hibbert Road, to the detriment of the residential amenities of the occupiers of this property, contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2023), Policy D3, D.7 of the London Plan (2021), Policy DM 1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010)."
