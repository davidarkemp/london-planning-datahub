    "Reason : 1 - The proposal development would be interconnected with an existing garage building forming a single outbuilding. The combined outbuilding would be situated on land forward of a wall forming the principal elevation of the original dwellinghouse, contrary to Schedule 2, Part 1 Class E.1 (c) of The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposal development would be interconnected with an existing garage building forming a single outbuilding.
