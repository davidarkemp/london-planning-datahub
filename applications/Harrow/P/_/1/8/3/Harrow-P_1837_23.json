    "Reason : 1 - The proposal, by reason of its overall massing, siting, scale and detailed design would result in the loss of important open verge adjacent to Alexandra Avenue and would be an unduly bulky, incongruous and poorly designed development which is incongruous in appearance, at odds with the character of the area and the prevailing pattern of development in the streetscene on the southern side of Eastcote Lane, and would result in disproportionate additions to the host building, which would wholly subsume the original proportions of the host dwelling. Furthermore, the development would break the visual alignment and verdant character of prominent grass verges running the length of Alexandra Avenue and would therefore be harmful to the character and appearance of the locality and the visual amenity of neighbours, contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023), Policies D3.D(1), D3.D(7) and D3.D(11) of The London Plan (2021), policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), policies DM1 and DM23 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010)",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed rear extension, in conjunction with the proposed roof extensions including dormers and the insertion of windows in the west flank elevation, by reason of it overall scale, resultant height, massing and siting in close proximity to No. 149 Eastcote Lane would lead to an overbearing and visually intrusive form of development and by reason of placement of windows within close proximity of this neighbour would give rise to the direct/ perceived overlooking of this neighbouring property, to the detriment of the residential, visual and privacy amenities of the occupiers at No.149 Eastcote Lane, contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2023), policy D3. D (7) of the London Plan (2021), policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).\r\n"
