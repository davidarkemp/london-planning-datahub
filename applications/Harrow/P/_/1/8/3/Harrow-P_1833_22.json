  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development due to the cumulative impacts of its inappropriate design, excessive height, depth, bulk, scale and massing would be visually dominant and overbearing, resulting in an incongruous addition to the street scene which would be detrimental to the character and appearance of the local area and the immediate low rise suburban townscape to the north of the subject site and would have a visually harmful eastern elevation. The proposal is therefore contrary to the high-quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies D3.D(1) and D3.D(11) of The London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 A., DM1 B. (a), (c) and (d) of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) ",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed development, due to its design, excessive height, bulk, scale,  extent of glazing and proximity to the rear boundary, would result in a dominating and overbearing presence on the close neighbouring residential properties namely to the north along Elmwood Ave (Nos.1,3, 5 and 7) and east at Kenton Court, would give rise to both real and a perception of overlooking of these neighbouring dwellings and their gardens and would materially impact the outlook from properties in Kenton Court. Additionally, due to discrepancies and inaccuracies regarding property numbering within the submitted Sunlight/Daylight Assessment, it cannot be accurately determined whether the development has an acceptable sunlight/daylight impact on surrounding properties, namely No.1 Elmwood Ave and on any property regarding direct sunlight access. Furthermore, due to the proximity of the bin store at the flank elevation and shared boundary of No.1 Elmwood Ave there is potential for adverse amenity impacts on that property in terms of bad odours and vermin. As such, the development has a material impact on the amenity of neighbouring properties in terms of overlooking, loss of privacy and outlook and overbearing appearance, potential odour and vermin, and has failed to accurately demonstrate the impact on sunlight/daylight on surrounding properties and is therefore contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policy D3.D(7) of The London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1 of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), and policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013).",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed development, due to lack of defensible space and excessive number of entrances/exits fails to comply with Secure by Design principles and therefore it fails to ensure appropriate security and safety for future guests of the development and is contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D11 of the London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1 (B) of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012) and policy DM 1 the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013).",
    "Reason : 4 - The proposed development, due to a lack of follow-up bat roost emergence survey to inform any required mitigation, as recommend by the Preliminary Roost Assessment, ambiguous Biodiversity Net Gain information and  unclear Urban Greening Factor details, has failed to adequately demonstrate that the development will provide appropriate Biodiversity Net Gain and Urban Greening, contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies G5 and G9 of The London Plan (2021), Policy CS1 of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012) and Policies DM1, DM20 and DM21 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013).",
    "Reason : 5 - The proposed development, due to the over reliance of wheelchair accessible rooms predominantly at the top floor and with others dispersed at first floor level and above, and due to poor internal layout with long corridors to lifts and staircases, and only a single evacuation lift serving the top floor, is not considered to have provided a suitably acceptable evacuation strategy and has not demonstrated adequately how the safety of building users would be met, nor how the proposed building would achieve the highest standards of fire safety, as such the development would be contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021) and Policy D12 of The London Plan (2021)."
