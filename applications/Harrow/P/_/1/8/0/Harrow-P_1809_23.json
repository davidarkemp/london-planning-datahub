    "Reason : 1 - The applicant has failed to demonstrate that the proposal would make appropriate provision of hard and soft landscaping to contribute to a high standard of design, layout and amenity in order to discharge condition 3 (landscaping), contrary to The National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policies D3 and G6 of The London Plan (2021), policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), policies DM1; DM22, DM23 and DM45 of the Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the Supplementary Planning Document - Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed cycle parking details are unacceptable and insufficient to recommend the discharge of Condition 5  (Cycle Parking) as the proposed stores, by virtue of their open sided design provide inadequate shelter or security for occupants, and vertical stands exclude less able people from being able to securely store their bicycle contrary to policy T5 of the London Plan (2021), CS1 of the of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM42 of the Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the Supplementary Planning Document - Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed bin stores are considered to be constructed of an inappropriate material and are considered to have a detrimental impact on the appearance of the host building and the wider streetscene, and do not adequately address Condition 6 (Waste Storage). The proposal is therefore contrary to the high quality design aspirations of The National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policy D3 of the London Plan (2021), Policy CS1 of the of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM44 and DM45 of the Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013), and the Supplementary Planning Document - Residential Design Guide (2010)"
