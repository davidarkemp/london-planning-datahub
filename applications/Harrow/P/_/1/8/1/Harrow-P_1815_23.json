    "Condition : 1 - 1. The provision of a lobby to enclose the eighth floor lift access in the south block.\r\n2. Alterations to the design of the red brick header panel coursing and bond to both the north and south blocks to improve building maintenance and performance.\r\n3. A vertical header course is to be added to the top and bottom of each red brick header panel to both the north and south blocks, for cavity drainage to be discreetly incorporated and prevent risk of long-term moisture damage. \r\n4. A band of red brock header coursing is to be  introduced across the top of the open stairs on the north elevation of the south block. \r\n5. Within the south block, an Automatically Opening Vent (AOV) is to be located at the east end of each corridor. The arrangement of each of the windows has been changed to increase its openable area and to meet relevant standards for the venting of smoke.\r\n6. Within the north block, an AOV window is to be located at the north end of the 2nd, 3rd and 4th floor corridors. The arrangement of each of the windows has been changed to increase its openable area and to meet relevant standards for the venting of smoke.\r\n7. Five north facing obscure glazed slot windows located on the northern elevation of the north block are to be removed due to their proximity to fire escape stairs, and to ensure that appropriate fire safety measures are met. \r\n"
