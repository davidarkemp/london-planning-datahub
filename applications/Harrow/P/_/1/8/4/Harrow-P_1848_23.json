    "Reason : 1 - The proposed roof lights, by way of their discordant design within the wider context of the High Street street scene, and the unacceptable protrusion of the rooflights from the fabric of the roof, would form an cluttered incongruous, discordant, and obtrusive addition to the host site and street scene. The proposal would cause harm to the conservation area and the setting of a listed building without clear and convincing justification, nor are there public benefits to outweigh said harm.  The proposal would thereby be contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023), Policies  D3.D(11)  and HC1 of The London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policies DM1 and DM7 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the Harrow on the Hill Village Conservation Area Appraisal and Management Strategy (2008)."
