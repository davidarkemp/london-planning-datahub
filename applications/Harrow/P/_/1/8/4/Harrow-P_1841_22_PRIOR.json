    "Reason : 1 - The proposal, by reason of its rearward projection and siting, would be detrimental to the amenities of the neighbouring occupiers at No. 14 Thistlecroft Gardens, contrary to Policy DM1 of the Development Management Policies Local Plan document (2013) and the relevant provisions of the adopted Harrow Supplementary Planning Document Residential Design Guide (2010).\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed gap does not represent a material separation and as such, the existing outbuilding/garage and proposed rear extension are considered to constitute a single development. On this basis, the proposal would extend beyond the original side wall and would have a width greater than half the width of the original dwellinghouse and would extend beyond the side and rear elevations of the original dwellinghouse by more than 6m. The proposal would therefore not be within the tolerances of Schedule 2, Part 1, Class A (j)(iii), (g)(i) and (j)(a) to Class A of Part 1 (of Schedule 2) of The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015, as amended.\r\n"
