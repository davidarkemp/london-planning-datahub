    "Reason : 1 - The applicant has indicated that the site has not been vacant for a period of at least 3 months prior to the application for prior approval, the application is therefore contrary to the requirements of Class MA.1.(1)(a) of Part 3, Schedule 2 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development (England) Order 2015, as amended.",
    "Reason : 2 - In the absence of proposed section drawings detailing the internal head height of the proposed units the Council cannot be satisfied that the units would be provided with a sufficient internal head height in line with the minimum internal head height requirements set out within the Department for Communities and Local Government Technical Housing Standards - Nationally Described Space Standards (2015). The proposal would therefore be contrary to paragraph 3(9A)(b) of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) (Amendment) Order 2015 (as amended) and would give rise to substandard and poor quality accommodation to the detriment of the residential amenities of the future occupiers of the unit contrary to paragraph 130 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).
