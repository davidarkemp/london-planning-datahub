    "Reason : 1 - The proposed rear extension would adjoin extensions that have previously been approved under a separate planning permission (P/4105/21) which has not been implemented on the site. Notwithstanding this, when considered together with the approved single storey rear extension, the part single part two storey side extension and the single storey front extension, the proposed development would; incorporate an eaves height greater than 3 metres within 2 metres of the boundary of the curtilage, and extend beyond a wall forming a side elevation wall of the original dwellinghouse whilst exceeding 4 metres in height, having more than a single storey, incorporating a width greater than half the width of the original dwellinghouse and extending beyond principal elevation of the host dwelling and fronting a highway. The proposal would thereby fail to comply with the requirements of Schedule 2, Part 1, Class A, A.1(e), A.1(i), A.1(j) and A.1 (ja) of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "Reason : 2 - Notwithstanding reason for refusal No.1, the eaves height of 4.75m stated on the application form would exceed the maximum tolerance of the eaves height set within 2 metres of the boundary of the curtilage of the dwellinghouse and would exceed the maximum height threshold for a single storey rear extension. The proposal would thereby fail to comply with the requirements of Schedule 2, Part 1, Class A, A.1(g)(ii) and A.1(i), of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).\r\n"
