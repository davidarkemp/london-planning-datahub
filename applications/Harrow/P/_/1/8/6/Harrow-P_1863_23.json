    "Reason : 1 - Within the context of the planning permission P/5592/16 dated 22/06/2017, the proposed change in the external finish of the building would result in a material change to the character and appearance of the application site, street scene and area in a wider context. It would therefore require re-consultation of neighbouring properties, and the proposal would need to be re-assessed against the requirements of Policy D3 of The London Plan (2021), Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), and Policy DM1 of the Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013)."
