    "Reason : 1 - The proposed single storey rear extension, in conjunction with existing rear extension, by reason of its excessive bulk, scale and depth, would result in a disproportionate addition to the original dwellinghouse, and would  represent a form of development on the site that is out of character with the prevailing pattern of development in the area, to the detriment of the character and appearance of the subject dwellinghouse and the locality, contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policy D3 of the London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1  of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010)."
