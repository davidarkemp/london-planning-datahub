    "Reason : 1 - 1. The submitted application contains inconsistencies, namely the depth of the proposed extension shown on the proposed ground floor plan does not match the depth measured on the site block plan. Furthermore, the development shown on the proposed site block plan is shown to be greater than 6 metres beyond the original rear wall of the dwellinghouse.  As such, the local planning authority is therefore unable to make a determination on the proposed development under limitation A.4(2)(a)(i) to Class A of Part 1 (of Schedule 2) of The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015, as amended, due to inaccurate information being provided to comply with condition A.4(2)(a)(i) and A.4(2)(b) to Class A of Part 1 (of Schedule 2) of The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015, as amended and the resultant development shown on the site block plan would exceed the limitations set out under A.1(g)(i) of Class A of Part 1 (of Schedule 2) of The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015, as amended and therefore the development would not be permitted development."
