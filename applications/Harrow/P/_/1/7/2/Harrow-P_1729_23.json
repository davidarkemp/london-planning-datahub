    "Reason : 1 - The existing single storey rear extension in conjunction with the single storey outbuilding, by reason of their siting, excessive height and rearward projection, would be unduly obtrusive and would result in a loss of light, overshadowing and outlook, to the  detriment  of the visual and residential amenities of the occupiers of the adjacent properties no. 19 and no. 23 Connaught Road, contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D3 (7) of the London Plan (2021), Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 2 - The single storey rear extension and chimney, by reason of its siting in the rear garden, the excessive chimney height and the production of smoke and fumes from the chimney, would  represent an incongruous form of development on the site that is out of character with the prevailing pattern of development in the area, to the detriment of the character and appearance of the subject dwellinghouse and of the locality and would be harmful to the residential and visual amenities of the adjoining neighbours, contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policy D3.
