    "Reason : 1 - The  proposed development,  by reason of its narrow form,  poor layout and its inadequate gross internal floor space would result in a cramped and poor standard of accommodation, to the detriment of the residential amenities of potential future occupiers, contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies D3 D.7 and policy D6 of The London Plan (2021),  Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Plan Local Policies (2013),  the Technical Housing Standards Nationally Described Space Standards (2015), the Mayor of London, Housing Design Standards, London Plan guidance (2023) and the Adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposal involves development under the Town and Country Planning Act 1990, but the Local Planning Authority is not satisfied that, based on the drawings submitted as part of the application, the proposal falls within any  class of 'permitted development' specified in Schedule 2 to the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 1995.",
    "Reason : 3 - The existing outbuilding, by reason of its siting in the rear garden and its habitable function represents an inappropriate and odd form of development, at odds with the character of the area and the prevailing pattern of development in the locality, contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021),  Policies D3 D.11 of the London Plan 2021, policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), policy DM 1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010)."
