    "Reason : 1 - Within the context of the planning permission P/4008/21 dated 06/01/22, the proposed alterations would alter that external appearance of the approved development to such a significant extent that it would result in a material change to the character and appearance of the host dwelling, street scene and wider area. It would therefore require re-consultation of neighbouring properties, and the proposal would need to be re-assessed against the requirements of Policy D3 of The London Plan (2021) and Policy DM1 of the Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010). The proposal is therefore not considered to be non-material minor amendment."
