    "Reason : 1 - The proposed single storey side extension combined with the existing two storey side extension would exceed 3m maximum height, half of the width of the original dwellinghouse, and by reason of its siting, excessive bulk and  scale would result in a disproportionate addition to the property, an incongruous and inappropriate form of development, and the disruption of the harmony and architectural coherence of the host property and locality, to the detriment of the character and appearance of the original set of dwellinghouse and the established pattern of development in the area. The development therefore fails to meet the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policies D3 D(1) and D(11) of the London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010)."
