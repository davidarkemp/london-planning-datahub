    "Reason : 1 - The proposed single storey side extension due to its unsympathetic roof design would not relate well or harmonise with the design and appearance of the host dwelling. The proposal would result in an unsympathetic form of development which is unduly obtrusive to the detriment of the character and appearance of the host dwelling and surrounding area, contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policies D3 (D(1) and D(11)) of The London Plan (2021), policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010). ",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed single storey side extension, by reason of its siting and cumulative excessive sideways projection in combination with the host dwelling, would be unduly obtrusive and would result in a negative impact on the outlook of the neighbouring dwelling No.54 Romney Drive,  to the detriment of the visual and residential amenities of the occupiers of the adjacent property No. 54 Romney Drive, contrary to Policy D3 (D(7)) of the London Plan (2021), Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and guidance contained in the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010)."
