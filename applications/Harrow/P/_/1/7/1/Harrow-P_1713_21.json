    "Reason : 1 - The proposed entrance gates with metal railings, solid panelling and wall piers would constitute inappropriate development within the Green Belt and are detrimental to the character, appearance, permanence and openness of the Green Belt, contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D3 D (1) and (11) of The London Plan (2021), Core Policies CS1.B and CS1.F of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012) and Policies DM1 and DM16 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013). No very special circumstances have been demonstrated by the applicant whereby the harm by reason of inappropriateness is outweighed by other considerations.",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed entrance gates with metal railings, solid panelling and wall piers by reason of their unacceptable height, material, appearance and design, would appear as an incongruous and visually obtrusive addition to the street scene, to the detriment of the character and appearance of the surrounding area, contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D3 D (1) and (11) of the London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012) and Policy DM1 of the Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013)."
