    "Reason : 1 - The development, by reason of its unacceptable roof design and lack of visual containment of the rear dormer would give rise to an unsympathetic, incongruous, obtrusive, dominant and contrived form of development that would subsume the property and fail to respect the scale, character, massing, composition and design of the host and neighbouring properties, to the detriment of the character and appearance of the subject dwellinghouse, the pattern of development in the streetscene, and the visual amenities of the area, contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), Core Policy CS1 (B) of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), policy D3 (d11) of the London Plan (2021), policy DM 1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).
