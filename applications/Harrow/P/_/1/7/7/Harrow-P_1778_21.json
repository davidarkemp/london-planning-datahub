    "Reason : 1 - The proposal would result in the additional dwellings being sited on garden land. As such, the principle of the development is contrary to the Harrow Core Strategy of directing new residential and other development to the Harrow and Wealdstone Opportunity Area, town centres and, in suburban areas, to strategic previously developed sites and would therefore harm its implementation, contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies CS1.A and CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Garden Land Development (2013).\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed  single and two storey side to rear extension, together with the proposed rear dormer, by reason of incongruous and contrived design, disproportionate width, poor roof form and failure to provide a coherent pattern of development in the street scene and at the rear would substantially harm the form and proportion of the site, relationship with the properties in the locality accentuated by its prominent siting and poor architectural detailing to the detriment of the character and appearance of the streetscene and the pattern of development within the surrounding area and would therefore be contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies D3.D(1) and D3.D(11) of The London Plan (2021), Policy CS.1B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 of the Development Management Plan Local Policies (2013) and the Adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).\r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed first floor rear extension, by reason of  rearward projection and siting, would result in harm to the amenity of both the adjoining neighbour at No.99a Malvern Avenue and the occupiers of the host dwelling, by reason of loss of light and outlook. The proposal would therefore be contrary to the aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies D3.D(7) of The London Plan (2021), Policy CS.1B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 of the Development Management Plan Local Policies (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).\r\n"
