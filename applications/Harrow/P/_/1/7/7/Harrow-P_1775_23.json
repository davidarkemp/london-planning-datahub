    "Reason : 1 - The existing boundary wall, by reason of its overall excessive height and length, poor architectural design and detailing and failure to incorporate sufficient and appropriate landscaping, fails to preserve or enhance the character and appearance of the Stanmore Hill Conservation area and detracts from the setting of the locally listed park and garden, to the detriment of the Stanmore Hill Conservation Area and the setting of the locally listed park and garden. In the absence of clear and convincing justification for this harm, nor public benefits to outweigh it, it would be contrary to Sections 66 and 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990, The National Planning Policy Framework (2023), policy D3, D.1, D.11, D.12 and policy HC1 C of The London Plan (2021), policy CS1.B and D of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), policies DM 1, DM 7, DM 22, and DM 23 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the Stanmore Hill Conservation Area Appraisal and Management Strategy."
