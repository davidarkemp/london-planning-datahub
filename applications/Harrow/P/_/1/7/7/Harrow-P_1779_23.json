    "Reason : 1 - The proposed amendments would materially alter the appearance of the approved development and would result in a material impact on the overall layout, design, character and appearance to the extent that the proposal would impact upon the quality and standard of accommodation for the future occupiers of the development. Furthermore the proposed amendments would fail to provide the required space to accommodate the minimum number of bins for the individual bungalows, to the detriment of the amenities of the future occupiers of the bungalows. Therefore the amendments require a full assessment against the Development Plan and consequently the proposed amendments would directly conflict with policy D6 of The London Plan (2021), policies DM1, DM27 and DM45 of the Harrow Development Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010)."
