    "Reason : 1 - The proposed change of use would result in a net loss of industrial floorspace from the borough stocks, for which there is an evidenced strategic need to retain. The submitted information is unable to justify this loss of floorspace, therefore the proposal is contrary to policy 4.4 of The London Plan (2016), intend to publish version policy E4 of the draft New London Plan (2019) (intend to publish version), policy CS1 (O) of Harrow's Core Strategy (2012) and policy DM 31 C and D of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013). \r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposal, by reason of the proposed first floor overhang would fail to provide adequate outlook and daylight to the living rooms of both units. Furthermore, the proposed lightwell would result in an unacceptable loss of privacy between the units and would provide insufficient daylight and outlook to the kitchens of both units and therefore would result in a poor standard of living accommodation for future occupiers The proposal is therefore contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), Policies 3.5C and 7.6B  of The London Plan 2016, Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013), the Mayor of London Housing SPG (2016) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document Residential Design Guide (2010).\r\n"
