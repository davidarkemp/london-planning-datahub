    "Reason : 1 - The proposed tripe roof edge with middle end gable end and rear dormer resulting in an alien roof form by reason of its combined bulk, massing, siting, unsatisfactory design, and poor assimilation with the original dwellinghouse, results in an unsympathetic, incongruous, bulky, unduly prominent, top heavy and contrived form of development that fails to respect the character, composition and design of the host dwelling, and unduly detracts from visual amenity afforded along the street scene. The proposal would thereby be contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D3.D(1) and D3.D(11) of The London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 A, DM1 B. (a), (b), and (c) of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).\r\n"
