    "Reason : 1 - The proposal, by reason of its rearward projection and siting, would be visually obtrusive and would be detrimental to the amenities of the neighbouring occupiers at No. 16 and no. 12 Cannon Lane in terms of visual impacts; and due to its southern siting, would also result in a loss of light daylight and sunlight to no. 12 Cannon Lane. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy DM1 of the Development Management Policies Local Plan document (2013) and the relevant provisions of the adopted Harrow Supplementary Planning Document Residential Design Guide (2010).\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed single storey rear extension by virtue of its attachment to the existing two storey rear extension, would cumulatively fail the limitations set out under Class A, A.1(h) (i) which limits an extension that would have more than a single storey to 3m depth. The proposed development would therefore not be a lawful development and would be exceed the limitations set out under A.1 (h)(i) and A.1(ja) of Class A,of Part 1 (of Schedule 2) of The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).\r\n"
