    "Reason : 1 - The proposed demolition of the existing side to rear extension constitutes development within the meaning of Section 55 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended) and therefore requires planning permission and would fall outside of the limitations and conditions set out by Part 1, Schedule 2, Class A of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development (England) Order 2015, as amended.\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - Notwithstanding the above, the measurements provided in the application form stating the proposed height to the eaves are inconsistent with the submitted drawings. Therefore, the local planning authority is unable to make an informed determination due to inconsistencies in information provided to comply with condition A.4(2)(a)(ii) and (iii) of Class A of Schedule 2, Part 1 of The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015, as amended."
