    "Reason : 1 - The proposed rear dormer, by reason of its excessive size and bulk, would result in an overly dominant form of development that would be unduly obtrusive and incongruous and would detract from the appearance of the subject property and adjacent, properties, to the detriment of the character and appearance of the subject property and the surrounding area, contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D3.D.1 and D.11 of The London Plan (2021), Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 of the Development Management Plan Local Policies (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposal, by reason or of insufficient Gross Internal floor Area (GIA) together with inadequate living space for the first floor flat would provide an overall cramped and substandard quality of living accommodation, to the detriment of the residential amenities of the existing and future occupiers of the unit, contrary to policies DM1 and DM 26 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013)."
