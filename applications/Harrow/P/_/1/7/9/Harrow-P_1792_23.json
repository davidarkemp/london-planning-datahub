    "Reason : 1 - The combination of the existing and proposed front dormer, by reason of their prominent siting, excessive combined bulk and massing, and poor visual containment would constitute an incongruous, unsympathetic, insubordinate, overly dominant, and contrived form of development that fails to respect the character, composition and design of the host building, prevailing pattern of development along the street scene, and would unduly unbalance No. 84 and 82 Village Way as a semi-detached pairing. The proposal would thereby be contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies D3.D(1) and D3.D(11) of The London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policies DM1 A., DM1 B. (a), (b) and (c) of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010)."
