    "Reason : 1 - The proposed front porch and replacement doors and windows by reason of their inappropriate material finish and overall design, together with the lack of detailed roof plan of the existing and proposed roof would fail to preserve the character and appearance of the host dwelling and be to the detriment of the host dwelling and the South Hill Avenue Conservation Area. Additionally, insufficient justification has been provided to outweigh the identified harm to the character and setting of the conservation area.  The proposal is therefore contrary to high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies D3.D(1), D3.D(11)) and HC1(C) of The London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1.B and D of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policies DM1 and DM7 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and South Hill Avenue Conservation Area Appraisal and Management."
