    "Reason : 1 - 1)\tThe proposal would result in the additional dwellinghouse being sited on garden land. As such, the principle of the development is contrary to the Harrow Core Strategy of directing new residential and other development to the Harrow and Wealdstone Opportunity Area, town centres and, in suburban areas, to strategic previously developed sites and would therefore harm its implementation, contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies CS1.A and CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Garden Land Development (2013).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed part single part two storey side to rear extension, together with the building's existing part single part two storey side extension by reason of their excessive combined size, width, scale, bulk, footprint, massing, the proposed first floor side and rear element's insufficient set back from the eastern side boundary in conjunction with its prominent corner siting and the first floor side element's unacceptable wedge shaped design would give rise to a disproportionate addition which would fail to respect the proportions and character of the original building. Furthermore, by virtue of its prominent corner siting, the development would appear unduly prominent, incongruous and dominant when viewed along the street scene, at odds with the established pattern of development along the road.  The proposed development would therefore be contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies D3.D(1) and D3.D(11) of The London Plan (2021), Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 A, DM1 B (a), (b) and (c) of the Development Management Plan Local Policies (2013) and the Adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).",
