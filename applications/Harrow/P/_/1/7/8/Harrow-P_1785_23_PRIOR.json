Therefore, the local planning authority is unable to make an informed determination due to inconsistencies in information provided to comply with condition A.4(2)(a) of Class A. Furthermore, the proposed development would exceed a eaves height of 3m within 2m of the boundary which would exceed the limitations set out under A.1 (i) of Class A of Schedule 2, Part 1 of The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015, as amended."
