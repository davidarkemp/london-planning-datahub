    "Reason : 1 - The proposed two storey side to rear extension and first floor front extension, by reason of their siting, excessive bulk, scale and roof form would result in an incongruous and inappropriate form of development, interrupting the character of, and failing to harmonise with, the main house, the attached semi-detached dwellinghouse and the streetscene, to the detriment of the character and appearance of the original set of dwellinghouses and the character of the locality. The development therefore fails to meet the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policy D3, D(1) and D(11) of the London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010)."
