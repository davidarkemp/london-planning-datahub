    "Reason : 1 - The proposal, by reason of the inadequate GIA of the enlarged residential unit,  and lack of information on the floor to ceiling heights of the loft space bedroom, would create a cramped and poor standard of living accommodation for future occupiers of this residential unit, contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D6 of The London Plan (2021), policies DM 1 and DM 26 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013), Technical Housing Standard: Nationally Described Space Standards (2015), the Mayor of London Supplementary Planning Guidance (2016), �and the adopted Residential Design Guide Supplementary Planning Document (2010).",
    "Reason : 2 - The rear dormer, by reason of its width and its relationship with the existing roof over the two storey outrigger, would result in a poor design and an obtrusive form of development, which would be out of keeping with the character of the subject dwelling and the pattern of development in the area, to the detriment of the character and appearance of the existing and adjacent dwellings, contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D3 D.1 and D.11 of The London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document Residential Design Guide (2010)."
