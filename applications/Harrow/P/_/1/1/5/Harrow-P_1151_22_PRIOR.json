    "Reason : 1 - Due to contradictions between the maximum height of the extension as listed within the submitted application form, and detailed on the proposed elevation drawings, the accurate proportions of the extension cannot be established, as the maximum height listed on the application form is not consistent with the maximum height shown on the proposed elevations.  Given the contradictory information provided, the Council are not satisfied that the applicant has provided an accurate written description of the extension's maximum height. The development would thereby be contrary to Condition A.4, (2)(a) (ii) of Schedule 2, Part 1, Class A, of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended)."
