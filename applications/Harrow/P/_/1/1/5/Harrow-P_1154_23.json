    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development would result in a new dwellinghouse being sited on garden land and therefore the principle of the development is contrary to the Harrow Core Strategy of directing new residential and other development to the Harrow and Wealdstone Opportunity Area, town centres and, in suburban areas, to strategic previously developed sites and would therefore harm its implementation, contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D3 of The London Plan (2021), Policies CS1.A and CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012) and the Adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Garden Land Development (2013). ",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed development, by reason of its visually prominent location and siting, excessive site coverage, poor design, site layout, form, scale and massing and undue departure from established building lines at the rear, would result in an over-dominant and visually obtrusive development at odds with prevailing character, appearance, scale and pattern of development in the surrounding area contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policies DM1 and DM27 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the Councils adopted Supplementary Planning Document entitled `Residential Design Guideï¿½ (2010). ",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed development by reason of its overall design, layout, siting, height, massing and proximity to the rear boundaries of neighbouring properties, nos. 42 and 44 Hunters Grove would result in a large physical presence and cause a harmful impact on the amenities of the adjoining properties in terms of loss of outlook and an increased sense of enclosure. As such, the proposed development would be contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021), Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and guidance contained in the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).
