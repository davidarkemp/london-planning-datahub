    "Reason : 1 - The proposed single storey rear extension and the boundary fence, by reason of their siting and heights, would appear highly intrusive and overbearing, and would result in  loss of outlook, to the detriment of the residential and visual amenities of the occupiers of the neighbouring property at No. 14 Thistlecroft Gardens. As such, the proposed development would be contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D3.D (7) and (11) of the London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and guidance contained in the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010)."
