    "Reason : 1 - In the absence of an adequate Noise Impact Assessment, insufficient information exists for the Local Planning Authority to make a determination as to whether the proposal would result in unacceptable impact in terms of noise on the future occupiers of the site from the adjoining lawful use as a nightclub (Sui Generis Use). The proposal cannot therefore be determined to be in compliance with provision O.2 (1)(d) and paragraph W (2) (b) of Class O, Part 3 of Schedule 2 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development (England) Order 2015, as amended and is considered to be contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), policies D3 (9), (10),  D13 and D14 of the London Plan (2021) and policies DM 1 and DM 40 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013). ",
    "Reason : 2 - It has not been adequately demonstrated that there would be acceptable arrangements for the collection of recycling and residential waste which would not adversely impact on the surrounding highways network. The proposal cannot therefore be determined to be in compliance with provision O.2 (1)(a) and paragraph W (2) (b) of Class O, Part 3 of Schedule 2 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development (England) Order 2015, as amended and is considered to be contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), policy T7 of the London Plan (2021) and policy DM 44 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013).
