    "Reason : 1 - The proposed rear dormer in conjunction with the existing two storey side extension on a prominent corner location by reason of its excessive size and lack of visual containment would give rise to a bulky and dominant addition within the rear roofslope. On this basis, the proposed development would cause detrimental harm to the character and appearance of the host dwelling and the local area, contrary to Policy D3.D (1) of the London Plan (2021), policy CS1.B of the Core Strategy (2012), policy DM1 of the Development Management Policies (2013), and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).  ",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed development, by reason of the shortfall in the minimum total gross internal area, would result in a cramped and substandard quality of living accommodation for the future occupiers and would give rise to a substandard and poor quality accommodation to the detriment of the residential amenities of the future occupiers of the flat, contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies D3.D(7) and D6 of The  London Plan (2021), policies DM1 and DM 26 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013), the Technical Housing Standards Nationally Described Space Standards (2015), the Mayor of London Supplementary Planning Guidance (2016), and the adopted Residential Design Guide Supplementary Planning Document (2010)."
