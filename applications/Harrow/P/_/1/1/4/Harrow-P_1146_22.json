    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development is considered to be poorly sited and scaled and will result in an unacceptable loss of valuable soft landscaped space and an erosion of the semi-rural and open character of the school site, and would appear incongruous and out of keeping with the host building due to its side projection. As such, the proposal would not be in keeping with to the host building, or character and appearance of the college site and the wider conservation area contrary to National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies D3 (D(1) and D(11)) and HC1 of The London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1 (B) of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), policies DM1, DM7 and DM22 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the Mount Park Estate Conservation Area Appraisal and Management Strategy",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposal would have an unacceptable and material impact on the outlook from ground and first floor windows of the neighbouring property at Duneaves, by virtue of replacing an existing open lawn area with a classroom structure, contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D3 (D(7)) of The London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1 (B) of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012) and policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013)."
