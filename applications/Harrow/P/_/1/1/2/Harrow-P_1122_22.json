    "Reason : 1 - The proposed single storey rear extension due to its excessive depth and unsympathetic roof design when considered cumulatively with the existing rear extension would not relate well or harmonise with the design and appearance of the host dwelling. The proposal would result in an unsympathetic form of development which is bulky and unduly obtrusive to the detriment of the character and appearance of the host dwelling and the Tookes Green Conservation Area, contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policies D3 (D(1) and D(11)) and HC1 of The London Plan (2021), policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), policies DM1 and DM7 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013), the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010) and the Tookes Green Conservation Area Management Strategy (2009). ",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed single storey rear extension, by reason of its siting and cumulative excessive rearward projection, would be unduly obtrusive and would result in a negative impacts of outlook to the detriment of the visual and residential amenities of the occupiers of the adjacent property No. 38A Marsh Road, contrary to Policy D3 (D(7)) of the London Plan (2021), Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and guidance contained in the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010)."
