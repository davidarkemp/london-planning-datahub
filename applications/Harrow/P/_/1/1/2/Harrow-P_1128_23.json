    "Reason : 1 - The proposed two storey side extension, by reason of its incompatible design with the original built form of the dwellinghouse, its prominent location, and its overall scale and bulk, would form a dominant, inappropriate and incongruous form of development, which would subsume the original dwellinghouse and fail to respect its proportions, built form, character and appearance of the host dwelling, and the attached semi-detached dwelling, detracting from their visual amenity, the streetscene and the surrounding area, contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D3.D(1) and D3.D(11) of The London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013), and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed first floor rear extension by reason of its incompatible design with the built form of the subject dwellinghouse, would give rise to a dominant and obtrusive form of development, which would subsume the original dwellinghouse and fail to respect its proportions, scale, built form and character. The proposal is therefore contrary to the high quality design aspirations set out in the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D3 (D(1) and D(11)) of The London Plan (2021), policy CS1.B on the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 of the Development Management Local Plans Policies (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010)."
