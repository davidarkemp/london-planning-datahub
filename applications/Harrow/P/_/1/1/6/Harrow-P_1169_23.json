    "Reason : 1 - The proposed outbuilding by reason of its siting and the door and window in the rear elevation being in close proximity to the shared boundary with No. 77 Canning Road, would result in perceived overlooking and unneighbourly development, to the detriment of the residential  amenity of the occupiers of this adjoining dwelling, contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D3 D.7 of The  London Plan (2021), Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposal, by reason of its siting in close proximity to a protected tree in the rear garden, in the absence of any arboricultural report, has failed to demonstrate that the proposed development would not result in unacceptable harm during construction and long term post development pressure on the protected tree located on the application site. The proposed development would therefore be contrary to Policy G7 of The London Plan (2021) and policies DM1 and DM22 of the Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013)."
