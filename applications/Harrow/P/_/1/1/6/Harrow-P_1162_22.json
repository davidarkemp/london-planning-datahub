    "Reason : 1 - The proposed single storey side to rear extension, by reason of its excessive bulk, scale, and depth would result in a disproportionate addition to the original property due to the extension connecting to the existing garage, representing a form of development on the site that is out of character with the prevailing pattern of development in the area, to the detriment of the character and appearance of the subject dwellinghouse and prevailing character and appearance of the locality, contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policies D3 of the London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1  of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010)."
