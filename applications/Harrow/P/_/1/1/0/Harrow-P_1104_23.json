    "Reason : 1 - The proposed rear extension by reason of its depth, scale and encroachment on the rear amenity space, together with the staggered rear building lines along this section of Maryatt Avenue would reduce the amount of external amenity space for the existing and future occupiers of this site and lead to an overall cramped and enclosed rear garden area for this family sized dwellinghouse, to the detriment of the residential amenities of the site and the character and appearance of the locality. As such, the proposed development would thereby be contrary to Policy D3 (D(1), D(7) and D3 D(11)) of The London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1.B  of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed rear extension, by reason of its siting and close proximity to the boundary facing No.48 Maryatt Avenue, due to the small sized gardens and the staggered rear building lines along this section of Maryatt Avenue would appear overbearing, leading to an unacceptable impact on the residential amenities in terms of loss of outlook and light to the neighbouring property at No. 48 Maryatt Avenue, contrary to the Policy D3.D(7) of The London Plan (2021), policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010)."
