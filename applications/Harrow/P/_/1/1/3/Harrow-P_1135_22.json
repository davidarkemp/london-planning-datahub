    "Reason : 1 - The proposal fails to accurately describe the full extent of the development in the application form and does not reflect the existing site circumstances in the submitted drawings, specifically referencing extensions and subdivided dwellings that do not exist on site, contrary to Article 7.1 of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "Reason : 2 - Notwithstanding reason for refusal No.1, the proposal, by reason of insufficient gross internal floor area (GIA), failure to meet minimum bedroom requirements and inappropriate amount of outdoor amenity space to serve the likely needs of future occupiers and which does not have regard for the character and pattern of existing development in the area,  would create a poor standard of living accommodation for future occupiers to the detriment of their residential amenity, contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies D3.D(7) and D6 of The London Plan (2021), Policy CS1 K of the Harrow Core Strategy (2013), policies DM1, DM26 and DM27 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013), the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide Supplementary Planning Document (2010).",
    "Reason : 3 - Notwithstanding reason for refusal No.1, the proposal, by virtue of the scale, footprint and height of the proposed outbuildings would result in an unacceptable, incongruous, out of scale overdevelopment of the site, which is in excess of what the site can comfortably accommodate and which fails to reflect the broader pattern of development in the area. Additionally, the reduction in area available for landscaping would fail to support appropriate biodiversity. The development is therefore contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies D3.D(1) and D3.D(11) of The London Plan (2021), Policy CS.1B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policies DM1, DM21, DM22, DM26 and DM27 of the Development Management Plan Local Policies (2013) and the Adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).\r\n"
