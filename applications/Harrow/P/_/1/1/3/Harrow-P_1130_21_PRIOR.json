    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development would extend beyond a wall forming a side elevation of the original dwellinghouse and would have a width greater than half the width of the original dwelling house. The proposal would therefore not comply with limitations set out under A.1(j)(iii) of Class A of Part 1 (of Schedule 2) of The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015, as amended. As such the application cannot be regarded as permitted development.",
    "Reason : 2 - Insufficient information has been submitted to the Local Planning Authority to assess if the proposed development would consist of a raised platform at a height in excess of 0.30m. As such, the proposal fails to demonstrate that if it would exceed the limitations set out under A.1(k)(i) of Class A, Part 1 of Schedule 2 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 2015, as amended."
