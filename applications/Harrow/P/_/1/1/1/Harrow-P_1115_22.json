    "Reason : 1 - The front porch as built (and not as per the existing plans), by reason of its excessive width and siting where it adjoins the front bay window, and by reason of the poor use of materials on the side elevation, results in a bulky and incongruous addition which dominates the front elevation of the property, and which fails to reflect the form and character of the street scene, contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D3 (D(1) and D(11)) of the London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1 (B) of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), policy DM 1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 2 - The existing first floor rear extension by reason of the materials used in its side elevation, and its excessive width and attachment to the existing rear dormer window, results in a disproportionate, poorly designed and bulky addition to the subject property which detracts from the established pattern of development in the area and the built forms of the original and adjacent properties, contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021, Policy D3 (D(1) and D(11)) of the London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013), and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010)."
