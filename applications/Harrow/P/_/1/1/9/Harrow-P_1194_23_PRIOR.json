    "Reason : 1 - Condition 3 of planning permission P/1503/05//DFU dated 09/09/2005 restricts the use of the premises to those associated with the ground floors of Nos.7 & 9 fronting Village Way East without the prior permission of the Local Planning Authority. The site therefore does not benefit from permitted development rights set under Part 3, of Schedule 2 of The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended) as nothing in this Order permits development contrary to any condition imposed by any planning permission granted as set out under Article 3 (4) of this Order.",
    "Reason : 2 - Notwithstanding reason for refusal 1, the proposal would include operational development, specifically relating to the proposed replacement garage doors, creation of residential entrance and alterations and relocation of windows and would therefore not be within the limitations  of Class MA, Part 3, Schedule 2 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development (England) Order 2015, as amended which only specifically relates to the change of use of a building and any land within its curtilage. Consequently, in the absence of the proposed alterations, the proposal would give rise to poor quality amenity, accessibility and security issues, contrary to  paragraphs 130 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021) and would therefore fall to deliver a sustainable form of development.\r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - Notwithstanding reason for refusal 1, in the absence of any evidence demonstrating that the site has been vacant for a period of at least 3 months prior to the application for prior approval, the application is contrary to the requirements of Class MA.1.(1)(a) of Part 3, Schedule 2 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development (England) Order 2015, as amended."
