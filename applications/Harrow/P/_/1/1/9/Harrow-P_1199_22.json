    "Reason : 1 - Insufficient information has been submitted in relation to condition 3 (Demolition and Construction Method Statement & Logistics Plan ) to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority that the construction works of the approved development (P/5626/18) would not unduly impact on highway safety and the amenities of the existing occupiers of the properties adjacent to the site, contrary to policy T7(G) of The London Plan (2021) and policies DM1.B(f) and DM43(C) and DM43(D) of The Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposal would result in the over-provision of car parking spaces as it would exceed the maximum parking standards. Furthermore, the over provision of car parking spaces would provide little space for soft landscaping to soften the appearance of the approved development. Therefore, the proposal is contrary to The National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policies T6.1, D3(10) and D3(14) of The London Plan (2021), policy DM1.A, DM1.B(d)(e)(f), DM22(B), DM23(C) and policy DM42(F) of The Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013).",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed cycle store is of insufficient size to accommodate two standard bicycles and therefore it has not been demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority that sufficient cycle storage would be provided for future occupiers. Furthermore, the proposed siting of a cycle store and/or refuse store within the front forecourt would be unsightly and would reduce the opportunities for soft landscaping resulting in a detrimental impact to the character and appearance of the approved dwellings and the surrounding area. The proposal is therefore contrary to the high quality design aspirations of The National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policies T5, D3(10) and D3(14) of The London Plan (2021), policy CS1.B and CS1.R of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), policy DM1.A, DM1.B(d)(e)(f), DM22(B), DM23(C), policy DM42(F) and policy DM45(C) of The Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the Supplementary Planning Document - Residential Design Guide 2010.",
    "Reason : 4 - Insufficient and unacceptable information has been submitted on surface water disposal, surface water attenuation and foul water disposal. Therefore, the Local Planning Authority is unable to determine whether the approved development would have sufficient drainage facilities. The proposal is therefore contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policy SI13 of The London Plan (2021), policy CS1.U of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012) and policy DM10(A) of the Harrow Development Management Polices Local Plan (2013)."
