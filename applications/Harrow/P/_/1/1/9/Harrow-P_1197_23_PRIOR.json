The site therefore does not benefit from permitted development rights set under Part 3, of Schedule 2 of The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development)(England) Order 2015 (as amended) as nothing in this Order permits development contrary to any condition imposed by any planning permission granted as set out under Article 3 (4) of this Order.
