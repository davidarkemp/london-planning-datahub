    "Reason : 1 - The proposed first floor front infill extension and the proposed rear bay extension, due to their design, excessive size and scale, would not relate well or harmonise with the design and appearance of the host dwelling. The proposal would result in an unsympathetic form of development which is bulky and unduly incongruous. This would be to the detriment of the character and appearance of the host dwelling and the Harrow on the Hill Conservation Area, contrary to the high-quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policies D3 (D(1) and D(11)) and HC1 of The London Plan (2021), policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), policies DM1 and DM7 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013), the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010) and the Harrow on The Hill Conservation Area Management Strategy (2008).
