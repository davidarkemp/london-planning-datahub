    "Reason : 1 - The cubic content of the resulting roof space would exceed the cubic content of the original roof space by more than 50m3 It would therefore not be within the tolerances of Schedule 2, Part 1 Class B, B.1.d (ii) of The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "Reason : 2 - The window in the gable end which is an upper-floor window located in a wall forming a side elevation of the dwellinghouse, is not obscure-glazed, and non-opening unless the parts of the window which can be opened are more than 1.7 metres above the floor of the room in which the window is installed The proposed window would not be within the tolerances of Schedule 2, Part 1 Class B, Condition B.2 (c) (i) and (ii) of The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "Reason : 3 - It has not been demonstrated that the two rooflights in the front roof slope would not protrude more than 0.15 metres beyond the plane of the slope of the original roof when measured from the perpendicular with the external surface of the original roof.
