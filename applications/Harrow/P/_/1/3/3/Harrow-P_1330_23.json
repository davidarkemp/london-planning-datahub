    "Reason : 1 - Within the context of the planning permission P/3068/22 dated 20/10/2022, the proposed development would be different in its massing and overall proportions and would result in a material change to the character and appearance of the host dwelling, the Pinner Hill Conservation Area in a wider sense, and the Area of Special Character within which the site is located. In addition, the proposal would have a materially different impact upon the residential amenity of neighbouring properties, and with the host building being of a different volume it would have materially different impact upon the openness of the Green Belt. It would therefore require re-consultation of neighbouring properties, would need to be re-advertised through a site notice and press notices, and the proposal would need to be re-assessed against the requirements of Policies D3, HC1 and G2 of The London Plan (2021), Core Policies CS1.B, CS1.D and CS1.F and Policies DM1, DM6, DM7, DM16 and DM17 of the Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010). The proposal is therefore not considered to form a non-material amendment."
