    "Reason : 1 - The change of use of the outbuliding, by reason of excessive activity associated with the use of the site for up to 9 children would introduce a level of activity and disturbance not commensurate with surrounding residential properties. The proposal would therefore be detrimental to the residential character of the area and the residential amenities of neighbouring properties contrary to policy D3(7) of The London Plan (2021) and policies DM1 and DM46 of the Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013).\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - Insufficient information has been provided to demonstrate that the change of use would not give rise to additional vehicle movements and lead to injudicious on street parking to the detriment of the free flow and safety of vehicular traffic and pedestrians on the public highway. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policy T4 of The London Plan (2021) and Policies DM1, DM42 and DM46 of the Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013).\r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - It has not been demonstrated that the use of the existing outbuilding, sited in the rear garden of 26 Parkthorne Close  is a dual use nursery/ ancillary to the residential use of the subject dwelling. The form of development in this residential area is therefore out of character with the pattern of development in the locality and incongruous and at odds with the residential character of the area and the prevailing pattern of development in the locality, resulting in unacceptable levels of disturbance to the adjoining neighbouring occupiers from associated comings and goings, to the detriment of the character and appearance of the area and the residential amenities of the neighbouring occupiers, contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policy D3((D7) and D(11)) of The London Plan (2021), policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).\r\n"
