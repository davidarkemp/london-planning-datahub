    "Reason : 1 - The cubic content of the resulting roof space created by the roof extensions, together with retained roof volume of the existing ground floor rear extension would exceed the cubic content of the original roof space by more than 50 cubic metres on a semi-detached dwellinghouse. The proposal would therefore not be within the tolerances of Schedule 2, Part 1, Class B, B.1 (d)(ii) of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposal has not demonstrated that the materials used in the facing side elevations of the rear dormer, when viewed from ground level, would appear to be of a similar colour and design to the materials used in the main roof of the subject dwellinghouse. The proposed development would not therefore be within the tolerances of Schedule 2, Part 1, Class B, B.2 (a) of The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 as amended.",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposal is therefore NOT a lawful development."
