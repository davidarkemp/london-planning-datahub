    "Reason : 1 - The proposed single storey rear extension in conjunction with the existing outbuilding, by reason of its excessive size and site coverage would significantly reduce the amount of available private external amenity space for the existing/ future occupiers of this ground floor flat, thereby unduly compromising the ability of its occupiers to use and enjoy the rear garden as a larger flat to the detrimental of the residential amenities of this ground floor flat.  The development is therefore contrary to the Policies D3.D(7) of The London Plan (2021), Policy DM1 C and D(i) of the Development Management Plan Local Policies (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 2 - By reason of the fact that the site is located within an area of land liable to flooding, and insufficient information has been provided within the submitted Flood Risk Assessment to in relation to; compensatory flood storage and drainage strategy details, the applicant has failed to demonstrate that the proposed development would not exacerbate the risk of flooding within the site or increase the risk and consequences of flooding elsewhere. The proposal would thereby be contrary to the to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy SI 12 C and SI 13 of the London Plan (2021), Policy CS1.U and CS1.W of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM9 A (a), (b) and (c) and DM10 A, C and D of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013).",
    "Reason : 3 -  The proposed development is proposed to be built over and in close proximity to the culvert and an appropriate buffer zone would not be provided. Notwithstanding this, the applicant has not provided any information to demonstrate how the existing culvert would be protected during construction works to ensure it would not be damaged and result in flooding within the application site and elsewhere. The proposed development is therefore contrary to The National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policy SI12 of The London Plan (2021), policy CS.1.U of The Harrow Core Strategy (2012) and policies DM10 and DM11 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013)."
