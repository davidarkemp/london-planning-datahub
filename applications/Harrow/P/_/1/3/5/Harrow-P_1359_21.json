    "Reason : 1 - The conversion of the outbuilding to a self-contained unit would result in the additional dwellinghouse being sited on garden land. As such, the principle of the development is contrary to the Harrow Core Strategy of directing new residential and other development to the Harrow and Wealdstone Opportunity Area, town centres and, in suburban areas, to strategic previously developed sites and would therefore harm its implementation, contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), Policies CS1.A and CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012) and the Adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Garden Land Development (2013).",
    "Reason : 2 - The conversion of the outbuilding to a self-contained unit, by reason of its siting, its form, its layout and side dormer, introduces an incongruous and a poor form of development, which  fails to respect the prevailing pattern of development in the area, and fails to satisfactorily relate to its surroundings and its local context. The development therefore fails to meet the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), and is contrary to Policy D3. D (1) and (11) of The London Plan (2021), Core Strategy Policy CS1.B (2012), Policy DM 1 of the Harrow Development Management Plan Local Policies (2013), and the Adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).\r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - The conversion of the existing outbuilding to a self-contained unit, by reason of the siting and nature of the proposed use, insufficient space for storage, inadequate floor to ceiling height and lack of private amenity space, bin storage and cycle storage, would result in an over-intensive form of development which would give rise to poor living conditions for existing and future occupiers of the self-contained studio flat, and to a loss of privacy for the occupiers of the host dwelling and neighbours. The proposed is therefore contrary to the NPPF (2019), Policy D6.B, D6.E, D.6F (1),  D6.F (8) and D.6.F (9) of the London Plan (2021), Policy DM1 of the Development Management Plan Local Policies (2013); and the Adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010)."
