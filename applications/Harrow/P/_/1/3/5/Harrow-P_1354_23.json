    "Reason : 1 - The proposed ground floor front to side extension linking the main dwellinghouse with the garage, by reason of its excessive width, height and massing, prominent siting to the front of the dwellinghouse, unsympathetic hybrid roof, and the resulting loss of open space around the main building, would form an incongruous and unsympathetic addition to the host building and street scene, and would appear unduly at odds with the established pattern of development within the area. Furthermore, the proposed ground floor front to side extension linking the main dwellinghouse with the garage, together within the proposed ground floor and first floor rear extensions and existing extensions to the building, by reason of their excessive combined bulk, footprint and massing would form incongruous and disproportionate additions to the original dwellinghouse, and would excessively alter the dwellinghouse from its original form. The proposal would thereby be contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies D3.D(1) and D3.D(11) of The London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 A., DM1 B. (a), (b), (c) and (d) of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010)."
