    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development to provide a three storey building to provide between 4- 6 units within the proposed application site, due to its poor location given the adjacent land uses, public footpath and railway would result in a cramped and contrived form of development which would not provide a high standard of residential accommodation to meet the needs of future occupiers, nor would it provide a high standard of design. The application site is therefore considered to be highly inappropriate for a residential development and therefore the proposed land use is unacceptable. The proposal is therefore contrary to the high quality design aspirations of The National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policies D3.A, D3.D and D6 of The London Plan (2021), core policy CS1.B of Harrow Core Strategy (2012) and policies DM1.B and DM1.C of the Harrow Development Management Polices Local Plan (2013).",
    "Reason : 2 - Notwithstanding the first reason for the refusal of this application, it has not been demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority that the proposed amount of development would be appropriate or achievable, given the size of the application site or its constraints. Therefore, the proposed development would be contrary to the high quality design aspirations of The National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policies D3.A, D3.D, D6, D13 and D14 of The London Plan (2021), core policy CS1.B of Harrow Core Strategy (2012) and policies DM1.B and DM1.C of the Harrow Development Management Polices Local Plan (2013)."
