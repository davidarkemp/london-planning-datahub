  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed hip to gable in conjunction with the rear dormer extension, by reason of its inappropriate design, excessive bulk and massing sited on a prominent corner location would result in an incongruous, discordant and ungainly cumulative addition to the dwelling and the rear dormer by reason of its excessive size and lack of visual containment, would give rise to a bulky and dominant addition within the rear roofslope. On this basis the proposed development would cause detrimental harm to the character and appearance of the host dwelling and the local area, contrary to Policy D3 (D(1) and D(11)) of The London Plan (2021), Policy CS1.B of the Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 of the Development Management Policies (2013), and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed single storey rear extension by way of its excessive depth in close proximity to the neighbouring boundary would appear disproportionate to the host dwelling and visually dominant due to the narrowing of the plot to the rear. Furthermore, it would result in an unacceptable impact to the residential amenity of No.78 Gayton Road and would create a sense of enclosure, impacting on their outlook and daylight and therefore would not comply with National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D3(1) and (7) of the London Plan (2021), Policy DM1 B. (a), DM1 C., and DM1 D. (d), (e) and (f) of the Development Management Policies Local Plan document (2013) and the relevant provisions of the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 3 - The applicant has failed to provide a comprehensive Travel Plan to support a car free development in spite of the proposed increase in staff and has failed to provide an adequate level of secure, sheltered and accessible cycle parking to account for the uplift of users of the premises. In the absence of which, the proposal could give rise undue transport impact which would compromise highway safety and promotion of sustainable modes of transport, contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies T5, T6, T6,2 and T6.5 The London Plan (2021) and Policies DM1 and DM42 and DM43 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013).",
    "Reason : 4 - In the absence of an Acoustic Report to demonstrate the impact of the increased activity within the premises and on the surrounding area, insufficient information exists for the Local Planning Authority to make a determination as to whether the proposal would result in unacceptable impact in terms of noise and nuisance and would fail to safeguard the amenity of neighbouring residents. The proposal would therefore fail to accord with policy D3 (9) and D14 of The London Plan (2021) and policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Polices Local Plan (2013)."
