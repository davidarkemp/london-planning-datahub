  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed A2 Units, by reason of their inappropriate location, would result in an unacceptable access from a rear service road and an unacceptably poor level of natural light and outlook and would also harm the viability of the existing A1 Unit, which would be indicative of an overdevelopment of the existing site and inappropriate mixed use development, would be contrary to policies DM2, DM38 and DM40 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposal, by reason of failure to demonstrate acceptable refuse storage and servicing arrangements would result in an unacceptable impact on the amenity of the existing upper floor flat, ground floor retail unit and the proposed rear A2 Units as well as neighbouring occupiers and would also have an unacceptable impact on the character and appearance of the area, contrary to policies DM1, DM44 and DM45 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013).",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposal, by reason of failure to demonstrate that sufficient and adequate arrangements for servicing and access, and the storage and collection of waste can be made for the proposed Class A2 units, without prejudicing the existing uses on the site and the safe use of the service road, would be contrary to Policies DM1, DM40, DM44 and DM45 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013).",
    "Reason : 4 - The proposal, by reason of its depth and close proximity to the side boundaries, would result in an overbearing impact, unacceptable loss of visual outlook and light to the occupiers of the neighbouring flats at No. 247 and 249 Kenton Lane, to the detriment of their residential amenity, contrary to policy 7.6B of The London Plan (2016),  policy DM 1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the dopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 5 - \r\nThe proposal, by reason of the proposed  access arrangement from the rear for occupiers of the upper floor flat at No. 245A Kenton Lane, via the full length of a rear service road, would result in an unacceptably poor access arrangement that would be unsafe and impractical, resulting in a risk or fear of crime, contrary to Policy 7.3 of the London Plan (2016), Policies DM1B.g and DM2 of Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013)."
