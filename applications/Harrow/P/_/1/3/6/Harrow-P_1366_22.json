    "Reason : 1 - The proposal, by reason of its siting, would result in the loss of important grass verge adjacent to Alexandra Avenue and would break the visual alignment and verdant character of prominent grass verges running the length of Alexandra Avenue. The development would therefore be harmful to the character and appearance of the locality and the visual amenity of neighbours, contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies D3.D(1) and D3.D(11) of The London Plan (2021), policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), policies DM1 and DM23 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010)."
