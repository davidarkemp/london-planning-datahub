    "Reason : 1 - The proposal would result in an additional dwellinghouse being sited on garden land. As such, the principle of the development is contrary to the Harrow Core Strategy of directing new residential and other development to the Harrow and Wealdstone Opportunity Area, town centres and, in suburban areas, to strategic previously developed sites and would therefore harm its implementation, contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies CS1.A and CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Garden Land Development (2013)",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposal, by reason of its lack of defensible space in front of the proposed ground floor bay window, would create a poor standard of living accommodation for future occupiers to the detriment of their residential amenity and would fail to be informed by Secured by Design principles. As such, the proposal is contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies D3.D(7) of The London Plan (2021), Policy CS1 of the Harrow Core Strategy (2013), and policy DM1 and DM23 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013), the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide Supplementary Planning Document (2010).",
    "Reason : 3 - The development, by reason of cumulative impact of poorly sited car parking, and excessive car parking spaces, will prioritise vehicle access and parking over walking and cycling and it therefore exceeds the maximum parking requirements of the London Plan, prejudices highway safety and diminishes the convenience of pedestrians and cyclists, contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies T4, T6 and T6.1 of The London Plan Policy and Policy DM42 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013)."
