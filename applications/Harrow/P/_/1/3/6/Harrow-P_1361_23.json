    "Condition : 1 - Amendment to wording of Condition 8 as follows:\r\n\r\nApplications for approval of Reserved Matters for each relevant phase submitted pursuant to this permission relating to layout, scale and appearance shall be accompanied by a detailed Energy Strategy for that phase. The Energy Strategy shall explain:\r\n(a)\thow the proposed building design(s) realise(s) opportunities to include design and technology energy efficiency measures;\r\n(b)\tthe reduction in carbon emissions achieved through these building design and technology energy efficiency measures, compared with the emissions permitted under the national Building Regulations prevailing at the time the application(s) for approval of Reserved Matters are submitted;\r\n (c)\thow energy shall be supplied to the building(s), highlighting;\r\ni.\thow the building(s) Zones B-D relate(s) to the site-wide strategy for district heating incorporating tri-generation from distributed combined heat and power; and,\r\nii. How the building(s) in Zone A relate to strategy including an all-electric direct heating system and Air Source Heat Pump (ASHP) led system serving hot water demands for each of the residential units; and, \r\niii.\tany other measures to incorporate renewables.\r\n(d)\thow the building(s) have been designed to achieve at least the minimum requirement under BREEAM (or an equivalent assessment method and rating) prevailing at the time the application(s) for approval of Reserved Matters are submitted. \r\nAn energy strategy is only required to be submitted and approved once per phase.\r\nThe development shall be carried out in accordance with the details so agreed.\r\nREASON :  To ensure that the development contributes to climate change mitigation by meeting the highest standards of sustainable design and construction and achieving an adequate reduction in carbon dioxide emissions from onsite renewable generation, in accordance with the Environmental Impact Assessment, in line with the principles set out in the approved Energy Statement, i",
