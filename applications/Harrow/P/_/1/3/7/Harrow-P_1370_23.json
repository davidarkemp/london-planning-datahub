    "Reason : 1 - The proposed changes to the levels of site detailed within this application would inhibit future occupants of the mews houses from utilising the area directly in between both rows of mews houses as a high quality communal external amenity area, with the proposed retaining walls to the rear access road acting as a barrier splitting up the communal amenity area between the mews houses consented under application P/0768/20, and undesirably formalising the use of the rear access road for vehicular movement, resulting in a poor standard development. In addition to the above, insufficient details have been provided in regards to the full extent of existing and proposed levels across the site. The proposal would thereby be contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021), Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013), and Policy AAP4 of the Harrow and Wealdstone Area Action Plan (2013)."
