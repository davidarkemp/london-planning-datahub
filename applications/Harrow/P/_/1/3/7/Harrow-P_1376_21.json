    "Reason : 1 - The proposed boundary treatment and gates would constitute inappropriate development within the Green Belt, to the detriment of the character, appearance, permanence and openness of the Green Belt, contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policies D3 of the London Plan (2021), policies CS1.B and CS1.F of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), policies DM1 and DM16 of the Development Management Policies Local Plan 2013. No very special circumstances have been demonstrated by the applicant whereby the harm by reason of inappropriateness is outweighed by other considerations.",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed entrance piers, walls and entrance gates, by reason of their siting along the front boundary, their excessive height, their inappropriate design and composition would give rise to an unsympathetic and visually obtrusive form of development which would be harmful to the semi-rural character of the area and the openness and visual amenities of the Green Belt, contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policies D3 of The London Plan (2021), policies CS1.B and CS1.F of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012) and policies DM1 and DM16 of the Development Management Policies Local Plan 2013."
