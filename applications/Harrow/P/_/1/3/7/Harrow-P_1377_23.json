    "Reason : 1 - The proposed rooflights on the side roofslope, by reason of their siting would result in visual clutter which  would harm the unaltered, high quality traditional design that provides this area with a special character and appearance. The proposal thereby fails to preserve or enhance the character and appearance of this conservation area and there is no clear and convincing justification for this harm, nor public benefits to outweigh. The proposal is therefore contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies D3 (D(1) and (11)) and HC1 of The  London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policies DM1 and DM7 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the guidance contained within adopted Pinnerwood Park Conservation Area Appraisal and Management Strategy."
