    "Reason : 1 - The development, by reason of its cumulative excessive scale, bulk and poor design, gives rise to an unsympathetic, incongruous, obtrusive, dominant and contrived form of development, that subsumes the property and fails to respect the character, composition and design of the host and neighbouring properties, to the detriment of the character and appearance of the subject dwellinghouse, the pattern of development in the surrounding area, the visual amenities of the streetscene and the amenity of the occupiers of neighbouring properties, contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021) policy D3.D (1) and (11) of The London Plan (2021), policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012) and policy DM1 of the Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010)."
