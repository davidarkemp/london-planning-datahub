    "Reason : 1 - The proposal by reason of the rear dormer not being fully contained within the rear roofslope, has not demonstrated that the materials used in the facing side elevations of the rear dormer, when viewed from ground level, would appear to be of similar colour and design to the materials used in the main roof of the subject dwellinghouse. The proposed development would not therefore be within the tolerances of Schedule 2, Part 1, Class B, B.2 (a) of The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 as amended.",
