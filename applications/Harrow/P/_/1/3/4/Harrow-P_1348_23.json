    "Reason : 1 - The proposed single storey side to rear extension by reason of its excessive combined size, width, scale, bulk, footprint and massing would give rise to a disproportionate addition which would fail to respect the proportions and character of the original building and  would be at odds with the established pattern of development in the area. The proposed development would therefore be contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies D3.D(1) and D3.D(11) of The London Plan (2021), Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 of the Development Management Plan Local Policies (2013) and the Adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed rear extension, by reason of excessive bulk and rearward projection, would be unduly obtrusive, result in loss of light and overshadowing, and would be detrimental to the visual and residential amenities of the occupiers of the adjacent property, contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1 (B) of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), policy DM 1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010)."
