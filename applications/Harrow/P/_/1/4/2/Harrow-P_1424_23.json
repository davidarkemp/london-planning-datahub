    "Reason : 1 - The proposed single storey rear extension by reason of its siting and placement of habitable windows within proximity to the boundary with No. 52 Lyndhurst Gardens and at an elevated position in relation to this neighbouring dwelling house and the insertion of a side elevation window facing the rear garden of No.58 Potter Street would give rise to direct and perceived overlooking of the rear gardens of these neighbouring properties to the detriment of their privacy amenities. The proposal would therefore lead to detrimental impacts upon the residential amenities of these neighbouring occupiers, contrary Policy D3 (D(7)) of The London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1 (B) of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).\r\n"
