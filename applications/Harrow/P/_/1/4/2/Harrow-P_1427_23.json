    "Condition : 1 - Alter the wording of Condition 4 (Construction Logistics Plan) to read `No development shall take place, including any works of demolition with the exception of hand demolition of the spiral staircase and one storey offshoot, and hand dug drainage and foundation works in the rear yard only, until a Detailed Construction Logistics Plan has been submitted to, and approved in writing by, the local planning authority in accordance with the format and guidance provided by the Transport for London - www.constructionlogisitcs.org. The Detailed Construction Logistics Plan shall provide for: \r\n\r\n(a)\tParking of vehicles of site operatives/visitors;\r\n(b)\tHGV access to site - loading and unloading of plant and materials;\r\n(c)\tNumber of HGV's anticipated;\r\n(d)\tStorage of plant and materials used in constructing the development;\r\n(e)\tProgramme of work and phasing;\r\n(f)\tSite layout plan;\r\n(g)\tHighway condition (before, during, after);\r\n(h)\tMeasures to control dust, vibration and dirt during demolition, earthworks and construction;\r\n(i)\tA scheme for recycling/disposing of waste resulting from demolition, earthworks and construction works;\r\n(k)\tDetails of cranes and other tall construction equipment (including obstacle lighting). \r\n\r\nThe development shall be carried out in accordance with the approved Detailed Construction Logistics Plan, or any amendment or variation to it as may be agreed in writing by the local planning authority.\r\n\r\nREASON:  To minimise the impacts of construction upon the amenities of neighbouring occupiers and to ensure that development does not adversely affect safety on the transport network in accordance with policy T7 of The London Plan (2016) and policies DM1 and DM43 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013). To ensure that the works are agreed in time to be incorporated into the development, this is a PRE-COMMENCEMENT condition.'"
