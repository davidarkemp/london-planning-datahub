    "Reason : 1 - The proposed front and rear dormers, raising of the roof ridge height, together with the two storey side gable ended extension and crown roof by reason of their combined, bulk, massing and unsatisfactory design would result in an incongruous, discordant and ungainly cumulative additions to the dwelling and the rear dormer by reason of its excessive size and lack of visual containment would give rise to a bulky and dominant addition within the rear roofslope. On this basis, the proposed development would cause detrimental harm to the character and appearance of the host dwelling and the local area, contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D3(D(1) and D(11)) of The London Plan (2021), policy CS1.B of the Core Strategy (2012), policy DM1 of the Development Management Policies (2013), and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).
