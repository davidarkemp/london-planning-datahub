    "Reason : 1 - The proposal, by reason of the unacceptable location of the private amenity space for flat C, and the inadequate and cramped layout of flat B, would result in a poor standard of living accommodation for future occupiers of the flats, to the detriment of their residential amenities,  contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies D6 and D3, D.7 and D.8, and D.10 of the London Plan (2021), Policies DM 1, DM 26 and DM 27 of the Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013), The  Mayor of London Housing Supplementary Planning Guidance (2016), the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010) and Housing Design Standards LPG (2023).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed sub-division of the amenity space would result in over intensification of the use of the garden to the detriment of the character and appearance of the surrounding area, contrary to the high quality design aspirations of National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D3 D.1 and D.11 of The London Plan (2021), Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1.B of The Harrow Core Strategy (2012) and Policies DM1 and DM 27  of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010)",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposal, by reason, excessive car parking provision within the front forecourt and the siting of the refuse and waste recycling bins and bicycle stores, in the front garden area, would  result in a cluttered and poor quality environment and would fail to provide secure cycle parking, to the detriment of the character and appearance of the subject property and the streetscene and the objectives of promoting sustainable transport, contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Core Policy CS.1B of the Harrow Core Strategy, Policies D3.D1, D.11 and T5 of the London Plan (2021), Policies DM 1, DM 26, DM23, DM42 and DM45 of the Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 4 - The proposed rear dormer by reason of its excessive width and prominent siting  would fail to respect the scale and proportions of the existing roof form and would give rise to a visually obtrusive and overly dominant extension, to the detriment of the character and appearance of the existing building and the surrounding area, contrary to the high quality design aspirations of National Planning Policy Framework (2021), ), Policy D3 D.1 and D.11 of The London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1.B of The Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 5 - The proposed single and two storey side and single storey rear extensions, by reason of their siting, cumulative bulk and excessive scale, would appear obtrusive and incongruous, especially within its corner site setting and would detract from the prevailing pattern of development in the street scene, to the detriment of the character and appearance of the subject property and the area, contrary to the high quality design aspirations of National Planning Policy Framework (2021), ), Policy D3 D.1 and D.11 of The London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1.B of The Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 6 - The proposed single storey rear extension by reason of its siting, massing, depth and height and location along the shared boundary, will have an overbearing and enclosing impact on the occupiers of no. 9 Tavistock Road to the detriment of their light, outlook and residential amenity, contrary to the Policy D3.7 of The London Plan (2021), Policy DM 1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010)."
