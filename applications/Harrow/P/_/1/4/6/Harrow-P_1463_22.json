    "Reason : 1 - Within the context of the planning permission  P/3039/21 Dated 1/10/21, the proposed amendment would result in a material change in impact on the residential amenities of adjoining neighbours. It would therefore require re-consultation of neighbouring properties, and the proposal would need to be re-assessed against the requirements of Policy D3 of The London Plan (2021) and Policy DM1 of the Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010). The proposal is therefore not considered to be non-material minor amendment.\r\n"
