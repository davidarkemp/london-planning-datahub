    "Reason : 1 - The proposed single and two storey side extension together with the proposed hip to gable roof extension and rear dormer when assessed cumulatively by reason of their excessive combined width, bulk massing, and the side extension's failure to incorporate a sympathetic roof form, the forward projection of the single storey side element and the poor design and placement of windows would form an incongruous, discordant, contrived, unduly bulky and dominant addition to the host dwelling and street scene. The proposal would thereby be contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies D3.D(1) and D3.D(11) of The London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 A., DM1 B.
