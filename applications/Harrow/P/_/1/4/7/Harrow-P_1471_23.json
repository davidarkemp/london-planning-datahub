    "Reason : 1 - The proposed single and two storey rear extension and attached obscure glazed privacy screen, by reason of its siting, excessive depth, footprint, height, solid appearance and insufficient service area for the commercial unit, would result in a visually obtrusive and unduly bulky form of development and would have the potential to result in, inappropriate storage of refuse storage bins and delivery goods, to the detriment of the character and appearance of the subject building and the surrounding locality, contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D3.D.1 and D.11 of The London Plan (2021), Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1, DM 44, and DM 45 of the Development Management Plan Local Policies (2013).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed single and two storey rear extension and attached obscure glazed privacy screen, by reason of its siting, height, solid appearance, and inappropriate and inadequate refuse storage area, would result in a loss of outlook and sense of enclosure and overall substandard quality of living accommodation, to the detriment of the residential amenities of the existing and future occupiers of the first floor flat, contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policy D3 D.7 of The London Plan (2021) and policies DM1 and DM 45 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013)."
