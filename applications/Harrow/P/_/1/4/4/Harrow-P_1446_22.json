    "Reason : 1 - The proposal by reason of insufficient front garden depth to satisfactorily accommodate a car due to its restricted size and encroachment over the public highway; would be detrimental to the free flow and safety of the pedestrians and cyclists using the adjacent public footpath/highway, contrary to Policies T3 and T6.1 of the London Plan (2021), Policies DM 42 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposal would fail to provide sufficient front boundary details and provision of refuse and recycling bins to serve the existing flats and in conjunction with additional forecourt parking would result in a cluttered forecourt which would detract from the character and appearance of the host property and the locality as a whole. As such the proposal would fail to accord with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies D3(1) and (11) and D6 (E) of The London Plan (2021), Policies DM1 and DM45 of the Development Management Policies (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document Residential Design Guide (2010)."
