    "Reason : 1 - Notwithstanding its internal configuration as detailed on the proposed ground floor plan, the proposed outbuilding would by reason of its excessive footprint, bulk and massing, and separate and direct accessibility from the street frontage along Capel Gardens, fail to be ancillary to the host building, giving rise to the possibility of the outbuilding being occupied as a self-contained dwelling. Owing to the fact that the building would be sited on garden land, the principle of the development is contrary to the Harrow Core Strategy of directing new residential and other development to the Harrow and Wealdstone Opportunity Area, town centres and, in suburban areas, to strategic previously developed sites and would therefore harm its implementation, contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies CS1.A and CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Garden Land Development (2013).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed outbuilding, by reason of its excessive footprint, bulk, massing, visual prominence along street scene, proximate siting to locally listed blocks of flats at Capel Gardens and excessive scale in respect to the host building would form an incongruous, unsympathetic and contrived form of development, which results in an overdevelopment of the site, appears unduly prominent when viewed along the street scene, detracts from the setting of the surrounding locally listed flats, and would fail to be in keeping with the prevailing pattern of buildings within the Pinner Road Conservation Area. The proposed development would thereby be contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies D3 D(1), D3 D(11) and Policy HC1 C of the London Plan (2021), Core Policies CS1.B and CS1.D of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policies DM1 A, DM1 B (a), (b), (c) and (d), DM7 A, DM7 B (a), (b), (c) and DM7 (E) (a), of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013), the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010), the Pinner Road Conservation Area Appraisal and Management Strategy, the Historic England Good Practice Advice in Planning Note 3: The setting of heritage assets (2017), and the Council's Locally Listed buildings SPD (2013)."
