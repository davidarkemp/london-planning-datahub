    "Reason : 1 - Within the context of the Prior Approval P/2202/21/PRIOR dated 05/07/2021, the proposed rooflight would increase the maximum height of the rear extension and would therefore fail to comply with the requirements of Class A.1(g) and condition A.4(2), to Part 1 (of Schedule 2) of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development)(England) Order 2015, as amended. The proposal would therefore require neighbour reconsultation and assessment against the relevant paragraphs of Class A to Part 1 (of Schedule 2) of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development)(England) Order 2015, as amended. Accordingly, it is considered that the application for non-material amendment should be refused.\r\n"
