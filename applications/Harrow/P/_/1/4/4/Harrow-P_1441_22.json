    "Reason : 1 - The Council raise objection to the development as it would fail to adhere with the relevant technical requirements of the GPDO. A.1 (1)(d) of the Class A (a) of The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended) does permit the installation of masts of up to 30m on unprotected land or 25m on land on a highway in instances where masts are being replaced or altered, however in this instance the Council are not satisfied that the existing mast is being altered or replaced with the existing mast being located on a different site, away from the application site.. The proposed development effectively involves repositing the mast and associated equipment cabinets 7.5m north of the application site, which is not in keeping with the provisions of Schedule 2, Part 16, Class A (a), A.1 of The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended). A separate prior approval application is consequently required for the proposed development, under this application officers shall make an assessment on the acceptability of the siting and appearance of the equipment. \r\n"
