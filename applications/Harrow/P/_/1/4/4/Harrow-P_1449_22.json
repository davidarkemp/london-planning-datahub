    "Reason : 1 - The proposed outbuilding, by reason of its siting and encroachment on private rear garden area, would constitute Garden Land Development and would be at odds with the Councils spatial strategy for growth and would therefore harm its implementation and the sustainable growth of the Borough.  The principle of the development is contrary to the Harrow Core Strategy of directing new residential and other development to the Harrow and Wealdstone Opportunity Area, town centres and, in suburban areas, to strategic previously developed sites and would therefore harm its implementation, contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies CS1.A and CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012) and the Adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Garden Land Development (2013).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed outbuilding, by reason of its back-land siting in the rear garden, and its habitable function, would represent an inappropriate form of development, at odds with the character of the area and the prevailing pattern of development in the locality, contrary to policies D3. D (1 and 11) of the London Plan (2021), policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), policy DM 1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed outbuilding, by reason of insufficient gross internal floor area, insufficient provision of defensible and private external amenity space, insufficient space for the storage of refuse and recycling and loss of privacy for the existing and proposed occupiers of the subject site at No 102 College Hill Road and neighbouring occupiers,  would result in a substandard quality of living accommodation and would be harmful to the residential amenities of neighbouring occupiers, contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies D3.D (3, 5 and 7),    D6. A, D6 B, D6.E and D6.F (1 and 9) of the London Plan (2021), The Mayors Housing Supplementary Planning Guidance (2016), Policies DM1, DM27 and DM45 of the Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013), the Technical Housing Standards- Nationally Described Space Standard 2015 and the Adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 4 - The proposal, by reason of its poor siting and layout and in the absence of adequate measures to minimise the risk of crime in a visually acceptable manner, the proposal would fail to meet the specific security needs of the development in line with Secured By Design principles failing to create safer and more sustainable communities as well as safeguard amenity by reducing the risk of crime and the fear of crime, contrary to Policy D3 D (5) of the London Plan (2021) and Policy DM2 of the Harrow Development Management Plan (2013)"
