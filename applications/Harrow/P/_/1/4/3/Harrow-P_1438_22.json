    "Reason : 1 - Due to the overall scale, depth, width and siting of the proposed fixed canopy structure at the front forecourt and the inclusion of external roller shutters the proposal would give rise to an incongruous and overbearing form of development which would be harmful to the visual amenity of the streetscape.  This would harm the character and appearance of the subject building and the wider neighbourhood parade. The development therefore fails to meet the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), and is contrary to policy D3 (D(1) and D(11)) of The London Plan (2021), Core Strategy Policy CS1.B (2012) and policies DM1 and DM4 of the Harrow Development Management Local Plan Policies (2013)."
