    "Reason : 1 - The proposed first floor side extension and first floor element of the two storey rear extension together with the existing hip to gable and rear dormer roof extensions, by reason of their excessive combined width, bulk, massing, the first floor side extension's failure to incorporate a sympathetic roof form, the first floor rear element's awkward and visually cluttered amalgamation with the existing rear dormer, and the development's unsympathetic use of external materials would form an incongruous, discordant, contrived, unduly bulky and dominant addition to the host dwelling and street scene. The proposal would thereby be contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies D3.D(1) and D3.D(11) of The London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 A., DM1 B. (a), (b) and (c) of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010)."
