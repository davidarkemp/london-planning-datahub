    "Reason : 1 - The proposed single storey rear extension, by reason of its siting and excessive rearward projection, would be unduly obtrusive and would result in a loss of light, overshadowing and outlook, to the  detriment  of the visual and residential amenities of the occupiers of the adjacent property no. 47 D'arcy Gardens, contrary to Policy D3 (7) of the London Plan (2021), Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and guidance contained in the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed single storey rear extension, by reason of its excessive bulk, scale and depth would result in a disproportionate addition to the original property and would  represent a form of development on the site that is out of character with the prevailing pattern of development in the area, to the detriment of the character and appearance of the subject dwellinghouse and prevailing character and appearance of the locality, contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policies D3 of the London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1  of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010)."
