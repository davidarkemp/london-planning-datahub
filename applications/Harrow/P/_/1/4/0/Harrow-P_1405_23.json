    "Reason : 1 - The cumulative impact of the proposed two-storey side and rear extension and single storey rear ground and first floor extension by reason of siting, excessive combined bulk, massing and out of scale appearance would constitute a bulky, incongruous, unsympathetic, insubordinate, overly dominant and contrived form of over-development which fails to respect the character, composition and design of the host building, prevailing pattern of development along the street scene, the verdant landscaped/vegetated character and the setting of the immediately adjoining locally listed park/cemetery contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021),  Policy D3.D1, D3.D11 and HC1 of the London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1 (B) of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), policy DM 1, DM7, DM22 and DM23 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010)",
    "Reason : 2 - In the absence of sufficient information to demonstrate that the proposed development would achieve biodiversity net gain, would not result in harm to important habitat for protected bat species, and would not result in harmful removal or adverse impact to trees on the site and on adjoining sites, the Council cannot be satisfied that the proposed development would be in accordance with these requirements. The proposed development would therefore be contrary to the aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies G5 and G6 of The London Plan (2021) Core Policies CS1 of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012) and Policies DM20, DM21 and DM22 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013)."
