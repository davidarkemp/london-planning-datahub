    "Reason : 1 - The proposed extension by reason of its excessive depth would appear as a contrived form of development and an incongruous addition which would be harmful to the character and appearance of the host dwelling and the area, contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), Policies D3 (d11) of The London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1 (B) of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM 1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the Council�s Supplementary Planning Document - Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed extension by reason of its excessive depth and close proximity to the shared boundary would result in a disproportionate development which would appear visually obtrusive, and would give rise to a loss of outlook and overbearing impacts to the rear �protected� windows and amenity space of No. 8 Clewer Crescent which would be harmful to the residential amenities of the occupiers of this neighbouring property.  The proposal is therefore contrary to policies D3 (d7) of The London Plan (2021), policy CS1. B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), policy DM1 of the Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010)."
