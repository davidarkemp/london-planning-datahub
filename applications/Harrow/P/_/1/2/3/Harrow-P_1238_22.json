    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development, by reason of its shortfall in the minimum bedroom, storage and total gross internal area for flats 1, 2, 3 and 4, and the failure to provide appropriate unobstructed windows to all habitable rooms in flats 1, 3 and 5, would result in a poor means of light and outlook and an overall cramped and substandard quality of living accommodation for the future occupiers of the units failing to provide a fit for purpose residential units of an appropriate design, quality and layout, contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies D3.D(7) and D6 of The London Plan (2021), policies DM1 and DM 26 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013), the Technical Housing Standards Nationally Described Space Standards (2015), the Mayor of London Supplementary Planning Guidance (2016), and the adopted Residential Design Guide Supplementary Planning Document (2010).\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed development, by reason of the siting of proposed respective windows serving the single person bedroom in flat 1 and kitchen in flat 2, being in close proximity to the south-eastern site boundary and communal access, would result in an unsatisfactory standard of privacy for the habitable rooms in regards to the transmission of noise/general disturbance from the use of the communal access by other occupiers of the development. The proposal is therefore contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies D3 and D6 of The London Plan (2021), Policies DM1 and DM26 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposal, by reason of its poor and unsatisfactory layout and stacking arrangement would result in a poor standard of living accommodation for future occupiers in regards to transmission of noise/general disturbance between the ground floor, first and second floor flats proposed. The proposal is therefore contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies D3 and D6 of The London Plan (2021), Policies DM1 and DM26 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 4 - The proposal has failed to demonstrate that 75% of the internal floor to ceiling height of each unit would exceed 2.3m and as such the proposal would create a cramped and poor standard of living accommodation for future occupiers, contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D6 of The London Plan (2021), policies DM 1 and DM 26 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013),  the Technical Housing Standards Nationally Described Space Standards (2015), the Mayor of London Supplementary Planning Guidance (2016), and the adopted Residential Design Guide Supplementary Planning Document (2010).",
    "Reason : 5 - The proposed development by failure to provide adequate private amenity space for each flat would represent an overintensive use of the site and would result in a poor and inappropriate sub-division of the rear garden which would be out of keeping with the character and pattern of development in the area contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021),  policies D3 and D6 of The London Plan (2021), policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), policies DM1 and DM26 of the Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013), the Mayor of London Housing Supplementary Planning Guidance (2016) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010)."
