It would also be used for purposes incidental to the enjoyment of the existing dwellinghouse at 7 Moorcroft Way, Pinner, HA5 1LA. The proposal would therefore not require planning permission as it would not constitute development under the terms of Section 55 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990.",
