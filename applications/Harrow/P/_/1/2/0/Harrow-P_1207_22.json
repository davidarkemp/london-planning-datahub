    "Reason : 1 - Insufficient information has been submitted in relation to condition 3 (Demolition and Construction Management Plan) to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority that the construction works of the approved development (P/4574/21) would not unduly impact on highway safety and the amenities of the existing occupiers of the properties adjacent to the site, contrary to policy T7(G) of The London Plan (2021) and policies DM1 and DM43 of The Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013).",
    "Reason : 2 - Insufficient information has been submitted in relation to condition 4 (Construction Environment Management Plan) to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority that the approved development would make appropriate provision for the protection of biodiversity, contrary to The National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policy G6 of the London Plan (2021), policy CS1 of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012) and policies DM1.B(e), DM20.B and DM21.A of the Harrow Development Management Polices Local Plan (2013).",
    "Reason : 3 - The applicant did not submit either the 'first scheme' or the 'second scheme' in relation to condition 5 (Contamination). Therefore, insufficient information has been submitted with regards to identification, management and disposal of any potential contamination hazards. The applicant has therefore failed to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority that the the approved development would not activate to spread any potential contaminants on the site and that the land would be appropriately remediated. The proposal is therefore contrary to the high quality design aspirations of The National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policy DM15.A and B of the Harrow Development Management Polices Local Plan (2013).\r\n",
    "Reason : 4 - Insufficient information has been submitted with regards to the existing and proposed site levels (condition 7). As such, it has not been demonstrated that the proposal would be carried out at suitable levels in relation to the highway and adjoining properties in the interests of the amenity of neighbouring residents, the appearance of the development, drainage, gradient of access and future highway improvement, contrary to The National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policy D3 of the London Plan (2021), policy CS1 of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), policy AAP4 of the Harrow & Wealdstone Area Action Plan (2013) and policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Polices Local Plan (2013).\r\n"
