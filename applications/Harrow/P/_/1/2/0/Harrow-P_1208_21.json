    "Reason : 1 - The existing residential unit, by reason of its location and orientation fronting a service road, would give rise to an inappropriate form of development at odds with the established pattern of development in the area, to the detriment of its character and contrary to the high-quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies D3.D (1), and D3.D (11) of The London Plan (2021) and Policies DM1 and DM2 of the Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013).",
    "Reason : 2 - The existing residential unit, by reason of poor articulation to its front elevation, its siting where it fronts a service road, and lack of external private amenity space, results in a cramped, discordant, awkward and poor form of development which does not enhance local context or respond well to local distinctiveness,  contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies D3.D (1), (6), (11), and D6.F (9) of The London Plan (2021), Policies DM1 and DM27 of the Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013), The Mayor of London Housing Supplementary Planning Guidance (2016), and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 3 - The existing residential unit, by reason of the lack of space for refuse and recycling storage, and by reason of the siting of rear and side windows in relation to the existing uses on site and subsequent loss of privacy and outlook, results in a substandard quality of living accommodation to the detriment of existing and future occupiers, contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies D3.D (7), D6.B, and D6.E of The London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policies DM1 and DM45 of the Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).\r\n",
    "Reason : 4 - The existing residential unit, by reason of its siting where it directly fronts a service road and subsequent lack of defensible space, and its internal configuration and relationship with existing commercial uses, creates a poor form of development which increases fear of crime and does not provide a safe and secure environment which is inviting for people to use, to the detriment of existing and future occupiers, and contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies D3.D (3), (5), (10) and D11 of The London Plan (2021), Policies DM1 and DM2 of the Development Management Policies Plan (2013), and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).\r\n"
