    "Reason : 1 - The proposed single storey front extension by reason of its excessive forward projection and the two storey side extension by reason of its lack of set back at the first floor from the adjacent front wall, would result in an overly dominant form of development, that would fail to respect the proportions of the existing dwellinghouse and the prevailing pattern of development in the area, to the detriment of the character and appearance of the existing dwellinghouse and the surrounding area, contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policy D1.D(1) and (11) of The London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1 B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document Residential Design Guide (2010)."
