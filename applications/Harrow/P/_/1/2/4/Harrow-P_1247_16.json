    "Reason : 1 - The proposed footprint, scale, mass, bulk, and  amount of development proposed, and its siting, is considered to represent poor quality design which would appear as a visually cramped form of development and would fail to respect, relate, and respond to the character, appearance and pattern of development of the application site and surrounding area. As such, the proposal fails to satisfy the National Planning Policy Framework (2012), Policies 7.4B and 7.6B of The London Plan (2015), Core policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy AAP4(B) of the Harrow and Wealdstone Area Action Plan (2013), Policy DM 1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed four storey side extension, by reason of its siting on the boundary with No. 21 High Street, and the loss of space about the building at four storeys in scale, would give rise to a development which would fail to respect the spatial setting of the existing host building and the grain and pattern of existing development in the street scene, to the detriment of the character and appearance of the existing building and the locality,  contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2012), policies 7.4 B and 7.6 B of The London Plan (2015), Core Policy CS1 (B) of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM 1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposal, by reason of the siting, size, layout, cramped form of development, and orientation of the proposed residential units, would cause detrimental amenity impacts to the potential future occupiers in terms of inadequate levels of outlook and visual amenity, an overbearing sense of enclosure, and actual and perceived overlooking between the proposed residential units, and between the proposed residential units and the potential neighbouring occupiers to the immediate south by means of an extant planning permission at No.19 High St, contrary to policy 7.6 of The London Plan (2015), policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013), and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 4 - The proposal, by reason of the inadequate Gross Internal Area of Flats 6 and 7, would represent poor quality design as it would create a poor standard of living accommodation for future occupiers, contrary to contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2012), Policy 3.5C of The London Plan 2015 and the 2016 Mayor of Londons Housing Supplementary Planning Guidance, Policy AAP4 of the Harrow and Wealdstone Area Action Plan (2013), Policies DM1 and DM26 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 5 - The proposed refuse provision, by reason of its unsatisfactory access, siting, and resultant layout, is considered poor quality design contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2012), Policy AAP4 of the Harrow and Wealdstone Area Action Plan (2013), Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 6 - The proposed flats, by reason of poor layout and inadequate stacking arrangements, would create a poor standard of living accommodation for the future occupiers of Flats 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 through disturbance between neighbouring occupiers, contrary to Policy 3.5 of The London Plan (consolidated with alterations since 2011)(2015), the Mayor of London Supplementary Planning Guidance (2016), Policy AAP4 of the Harrow and Wealdstone Area Action Plan (2013), Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013), and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 7 - The proposed amenity space provision, by reason of its size, location and design, is considered poor quality design which would fail to satisfy the National Planning Policy Framework (2012), Policy 3.5 of The London Plan (consolidated with alterations since 2011)(2015), the Mayor of London Supplementary Planning Guidance (2016), Policy AAP4 of the Harrow and Wealdstone Area Action Plan (2013), Policies DM1 and DM27 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013), and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010)."
