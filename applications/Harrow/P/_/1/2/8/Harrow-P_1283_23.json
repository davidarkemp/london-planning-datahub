    "Reason : 1 - The proposed single and two storey rear extension, when considered cumulatively with the existing rear extension and attached garage by reason of their scale, overall bulk at ground floor level and siting would result in an insubordinate and bulky addition to the host dwellinghouse, to the detriment of the character and appearance of the host dwelling and the wider area, contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D3 (D(1) and (11)) of The  London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 A, DM1 B (a), (b) and (c) of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed single rear element of the proposed development, by reason of its depth and siting would give rise to an overbearing, unneighbourly and visually obtrusive form of development which would result in an unacceptable impact on the amenities of No.136 Arundel Avenue, to the detriment of the residential amenities of this neighbouring occupiers. The proposed development would thereby be contrary to Policy D3 D (7) of the London Plan (2021), Policy DM1 of the Development Management Policies Local Plan document (2013) and the relevant provisions of the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010)."
