    "Reason : 1 - The proposed two storey side extension, by reason of  its siting and excessive bulk, would give rise to an unduly obtrusive, overbearing and overly dominant development in a visually prominent location, to the detriment of the character and appearance of the dwellinghouse and street scene, contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D3 of The London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1 (B) of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), policy DM 1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 2 - In the absence of an Arboricultural Report, the application has failed to demonstrate that the development would not result in the loss of trees, which are of significant amenity value, as a result of post development pressure, and has failed to propose replacement trees, to the detriment of the character and appearance of the surrounding area, contrary to policies D3 and G7 of the London Plan (2021) and policy DM 22 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013)."
