  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposal would result in the buildings being sited on garden land. As such, the principle of the development is contrary to the Harrow Core Strategy of directing new residential and other development to the Harrow and Wealdstone Opportunity Area, town centres and, in suburban areas, to strategic previously developed sites and would therefore harm its implementation, contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies CS1.A and CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Garden Land Development (2013).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed development, by reason of its cramped layout, insufficient provision of high quality amenity space within the shared courtyard, it's over intensive use of hardsurfacing and insufficient provision of soft landscaping and planting to the front forecourt, shared courtyard and the rear of Block B, the excessive scale, height, bulk, verticality and visual prominence of Block A when viewed along the street scene, particularly in context with the adjacent two storey building at No. 275 Pinner Road, Block A's austere design and lack of characterful detailing, and finally Block B's poor street presence, would result in an incongruous, unsympathetic and contrived form of development which represents an overdevelopment of the site, and unduly detracts from the overall visual amenity of the street scene and wider area as a whole. The proposal would thereby be contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies D3 D(1) and D3 D(11) of the London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policies DM1 A, DM1 B (a), (b), (c), (d) and (e), DM22 B and DM 23 C of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013), the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010)",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed development would fail to provide any private outdoor amenity space for occupants of Flats B07, B12 and B17 contrary to the minimum prescribed standards set out within the London Plan and the Mayor of London's Housing SPG (2016). The quantum and quality of communal amenity space provided for the development would be insufficient, furthermore this space would be dominated by children's play equipment meaning that it would provide very little amenity for adults. In light of the above, prospective occupants would be provided with a substandard form of accommodation contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies D3 D (7) and D6 F (9) of the London Plan (2021) Core Policy CS1.K of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policies DM1 C, DM1 B (d), DM27 A and C of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010), and the aforementioned Mayor of London Housing SPG (2016)",
    "Reason : 4 - The proposed rear facing habitable room windows and terraces of Flats B05, B06, B07, B10, B11, B12, B15, B16, B17, B19 and B20 would be provided with poor quality outlook and visual amenity as they would directly overlook the unsightly train tracks to the rear of the site, with the narrow strip of soft landscaping and boundary planting in between the rear of the site and train tracks forming an insignificant visual buffer. Particular harm would be afforded to the rear facing habitable room windows of Flat B07 given that these windows would sit adjacent to, and behind the bulky roof form of the bus depot of the west of the site.  Furthermore, based on the limited separation distances between Blocks A and B, and the siting of Block A's expansive rear facing windows and terraces and Block B's expansive front facing windows and terraces, there would be unacceptable impacts of harmful mutual overlooking, and facing windows and terraces would be provided with poor quality outlook with the close siting between the two buildings creating an unacceptable sense of enclosure. In light of the above, prospective occupants would be provided with a substandard form of accommodation contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies D3 D(7) and D6(C) of the London Plan (2021) Core Policy CS1.K of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policies DM1 C, DM1 D (a), (b), (c), (e), (f) and (g) of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010), and the aforementioned Mayor of London Housing SPG (2016).",
    "Reason : 5 - The Proposed development, by reason of its failure to provide secure vehicular and pedestrian access gates, operable via video and audio access control systems to the undercroft associated with Block A, could give rise to unauthorised access to the site's central courtyard leading to loitering, anti-social behaviour and significant risks of crime and disorder. The proposed development would thereby be contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework, Policy D11 C of the London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1.E of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM2 A (d) of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013), in addition to Section 17 of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998.",
    "Reason : 6 - The proposed development, by reason of its failure to provide a sufficient amount of on-site car parking spaces to meet the development's expected car parking needs, within in area unsuitable in accommodating the necessary displacement parking along the local highway network, would result in an unacceptable increase in on-street parking strain within the locality. The proposed development would thereby be contrary to high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework, Policies T6 and T6.1 of the London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1.S of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), and Policies DM42 F, DM 43 B and DM43 C of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013).",
    "Reason : 7 - By reason of the fact that the site is located within an area of land liable to flooding, and insufficient details have been provided in regard to the proposed development's Compensatory Flood Storage and drainage strategy, the applicant has failed to demonstrate that the proposed development would not exacerbate the risk of flooding within the site or increase the risk and consequences of flooding elsewhere. The proposal would thereby be contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy SI 12 C and SI 13 of the London Plan (2021), Policy CS1.U and CS1.W of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM9 A, DM9 B and DM10 A, B and D of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013)."
