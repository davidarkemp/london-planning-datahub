    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development by reason of its siting in close proximity to the boundary of no.21 Haywood Close, due to bulk, scale, height and massing, would result in an overbearing impact, poor outlook and loss of privacy to the garden of no. 21 Haywood Close and future occupiers, due to potential post development removal of the existing tree lined boundary. As such, the proposal is contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D3.D(7) of The London Plan (2021), Policy CS1 of the Harrow Core Strategy (2013), and policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide Supplementary Planning Document (2010).",
    "Reason : 2 - By reason of the fact that the site is located adjacent to a Site of Importance for Nature Conservation (SINC) and insufficient information has been provided in relation to mitigation measures and Biodiversity Net Gain proposals, the applicant has failed to demonstrate that the proposed development would have an acceptable impact upon local biodiversity and ecology. The proposal would thereby be contrary to the to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy G6 A, G6 C, and G6 D of The London Plan (2021), Policies DM20 A, DM20 B, and DM21 A (e) of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013), in addition to the Harrow Biodiversity Action Plan 2015 - 2020.",
    "Reason : 3 - The application has failed to demonstrate that the development would not result in the loss of outlook due to the tree coverage, the loss of trees and/or hedges, which are of significant amenity value, as a result of post development pressure, to the detriment of the character and appearance of the surrounding area, contrary to policy G7 of The London Plan (2021) and policy DM22 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013).",
    "Reason : 4 - Notwithstanding the reason for refusal no.3 above, the presence of the trees along the southern boundary would lead to an impact on the outlook from the habitable windows serving both dwellings and would lead to overshadowing of the rear amenity spaces to the detriment of the enjoyment of their rear garden areas and to the living conditions of the proposed dwellings, contrary to policy D3(D(7)) of The London Plan (2021) and policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013)."
