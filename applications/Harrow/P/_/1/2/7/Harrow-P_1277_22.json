    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development would completely subsume the existing front projections of the host property to form a disproportionate and incongruous addition to the existing dwellinghouse. As such, the proposed single storey front extension, due to its poor design, layout, massing and scale would harmfully impact on the character and appearance of the host dwellinghouse, the group of bungalows to which it intimately relates, in terms of its architectural style, and would not respect the established pattern of development in the surrounding area, which would adversely impact upon the visual amenity afforded along the street scene. The proposal would thereby be contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D3 ((1) and (11)) of The  London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 A, DM1 B (a), (b) (c) and (d) of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 2 - By reason of the fact that the site is located within an area of land liable to flooding, and insufficient information has been provided within the submitted Flood Risk Assessment to in relation to; flood data, compensatory flood storage, mitigation measures, and drainage strategy details, the applicant has failed to demonstrate that the proposed development would not exacerbate the risk of flooding within the site or increase the risk and consequences of flooding elsewhere. The proposal would thereby be contrary to the to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy SI 12 C and 13 of the London Plan (2021), Policy DM9 A, B and C and DM10 A, C and D of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013).
