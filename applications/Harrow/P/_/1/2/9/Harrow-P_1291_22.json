    "Reason : 1 - The excessive height of the single storey rear extension would fail to reflect the character and appearance of the host dwelling and therefore is of an unsatisfactory form of design and appearance. The proposal therefore results in an incongruous form of development to the detriment of the character and appearance of the host building and wider area, contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1 (B) of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), policy DM 1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed single storey rear extension, by reason of its excessive rearward projection and siting, would be detrimental to the amenities of the neighbouring occupiers at No. 73 The Avenue, in terms loss of light, outlook, overbearing appearance and overshadowing, contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D3.D(7) of The London Plan (2021),  Policy DM1 of the Development Management Policies Local Plan document (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010)."
