    "Reason : 1 - The eaves height of the proposed ground floor rear extension would exceed the existing eaves height of the main dwellinghouse. The proposal would therefore not be within the tolerances of Schedule 2, Part 1, Class A, A.1 (d) of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed ground floor rear extension would sit partially above the eaves of the main dwellinghouse and would adjoin the main roof form of the dwellinghouse thereby resulting in an alteration to the roof of the dwellinghouse. The proposal would therefore not be within the tolerances of Schedule 2, Part 1, Class A, A.1 (k)(iv) of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
