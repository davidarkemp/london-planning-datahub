    "Reason : 1 - It has not been demonstrated that the use of the existing outbuilding, sited in the rear garden of 156 Weald Lane is a use which is ancillary to the residential use of the subject dwelling. The form of development in this residential area is therefore out of character with the pattern of development in the locality and incongruous and at odds with the residential character of the area and the prevailing pattern of development in the locality, resulting in unacceptable levels of disturbance to the adjoining neighbouring occupiers from associated comings and goings, to the detriment of the character and appearance of the area and the residential amenities of the neighbouring occupiers, contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), policy D3.D7 and D11 of The London Plan (2021), policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), policies DM1 and DM35C of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010)"
