    "Reason : 1 - The proposed single storey rear extension together with the existing single storey rear extension, due to their excessive size and scale would not relate well or harmonise with the design, appearance and proportion of the host dwelling. The proposal would result in an unsympathetic form of development which would be overbearing and unduly obtrusive to the detriment of the character and appearance of the host dwelling and fail to respect the pattern of development in the wider area, contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policies D3 (D(1) and D(11)) of The London Plan (2021), policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), policies DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013), the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed single storey rear, by reason of its excessive combined depth with the existing rear extension and siting in relation to the neighbouring property at No. 34 Dorchester Avenue would be overbearing, resulting in a unneighbourly form of development that would be detrimental to the visual and residential amenities of the occupiers of 34 Dorchester Avenue in terms of outlook and overshadowing as well as appearing visually intrusive. The proposed development is contrary to Policy D3 (D(7)), policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010)."
