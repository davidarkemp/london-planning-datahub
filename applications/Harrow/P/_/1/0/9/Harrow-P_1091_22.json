    "Reason : 1 - The applicant has failed to demonstrate the acceptability of the loss of the industrial floorspace from the site, by reason of the lack of information the Council has not been able to comprehensively assess the impact of the loss of industrial land use from the boroughs stocks. The proposal is therefore contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy E4 of the London Plan (2021), Policy CS1. O of the Core Strategy (2012), and Policy DM 31 of the development Management Policies Plan (2013).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed three storey building, by reason of its excessive depth and height, its poorly designed flat roof form and subsequent massing and bulk, would create an unduly bulky and obtrusive form of development which would be harmful to the character of adjacent dwellings and to the character and appearance of the surrounding area, and would fail to meet with the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies D3.D (1) and D3.D (11), of the London Plan (2021), Policy CS1.B of the Core Strategy (2012), Policy AAP 3 of the Harrow and Wealdstone Area Action Plan (2013), Policy DM1 of the Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013), and the Harrow Adopted Supplementary Design Guide SPD (2010).",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed three storey building, by reason of the height and siting of its ground, first and second floor side walls, would result in an unacceptable loss of outlook and overbearing impact and sense of enclosure for the occupants at the adjacent No 1 Gordon Road, and would therefore be detrimental to their living conditions and in conflict with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D3.D (7) and D6.B of The London Plan (2021), Policy DM1 of the Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013), and the Adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 4 - The proposal, by reason of insufficient overall gross internal floor area of the ground floor unit and insufficient gross internal floor area of its single and double bedrooms, the proposed siting of the rear communal garden area for the office and residential uses and its relationship to windows of these bedrooms, the poorly designed form and layout of the shared external amenity space, and insufficient space for the storage of refuse and recycling for the residential units, would result in a loss of privacy and security for all future residential occupiers, and a loss of privacy and poor, cramped and substandard quality of living accommodation for occupiers of the ground floor unit, leading to an over intensive form of development which would be out of character with the area and detrimental to future occupiers, and contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies D3.D 1), D3.D 5), D3.D 7), D3.D 11), D6.A, D6.B and D6.E of the London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policies DM1, and DM27 of the Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013), The Mayor of London Housing Supplementary Planning Guidance (2016) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010)."
