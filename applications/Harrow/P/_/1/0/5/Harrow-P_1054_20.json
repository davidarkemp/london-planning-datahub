    "Condition : 1 - PRIOR TO DEMOLITION, and notwithstanding any planning permission, the applicant will commission and provide to the Council for approval in writing \r\na. A further reptile occurrence survey to run over a period of at least a month with 5+ checks over this period. Unless the survey felts have been left in place, the applicant might consider using `tins� next time which seem more suited to reptiles than roofing felt\r\nb. An assessment of the ecological value in terms of (a) biodiversity units in accordance with the Defra metric of the habitat areas within the development site and (b) locally notable and national priority invertebrate species either (i) found to be present by targeted site surveys or (ii) likely to be present based on geographical location and a survey of the plant species composition and microhabitats found within the site, taking account also of the habitat features within the adjoining areas of Stanmore Marsh.\r\nc. Identification of opportunities for delivering gain in accordance with this proposal (demolition constituting development in this case) and for any subsequent development proposals.\r\nd. A survey for hedgehog and/or identification of measures to prevent harm to this species.\r\n\r\nREASON: For the purpose of proper planning, to address national, regional and borough planning policy with regard to biodiversity conservation, and to ensure that the existing ecological value of the site is adequately mapped and properly quantified prior to any works commencing in order that appropriate measures to inform the directions given by the Ecological Clerk of Works in respect of the proposed demolition and to help either safeguard and enhance features or ensure adequate mitigation and gain for subsequent impacts.",
    "Condition : 2 - Any translocation of newts or other species from the development site to Stanmore Marsh would need to be agreed to by the landowner (In this case, the London Borough of Harrow). Such translocation would be likely to have an impact on animals already on this site, even assuming that they are effectively part of the same population and there would be need to an appraisal of the number of animals that could reasonably be translocated. Measures to increase the carrying capacity of Stanmore Marsh (or some other suitable receptor site) would be required \r\nThe reptile survey should ideally be conducted during April-May. A botanical survey would be best implemented in May. Direct surveys if invertebrates, e.g. pollinators, beetles, spiders would be required over a more extended period. Given the closed nature of the site, and existing CIEEM guidance I don�t consider that the Covid-19 outbreak precludes this work going ahead this at the earliest opportunity provided appropriate health & safety procedures are followed.\r\n\r\nREASON: For the purpose of proper planning, to address national, regional and borough planning policy with regard to biodiversity conservation, and to ensure that the existing ecological value of the site is adequately mapped and properly quantified prior to any works commencing in order that appropriate measures to inform the directions given by the Ecological Clerk of Works in respect of the proposed demolition and to help either safeguard and enhance features or ensure adequate mitigation and gain for subsequent impacts.\r\n",
    "Condition : 3 - PRIOR TO DEMOLITION, the applicant shall submit a demolition (and construction) management plan to the Local Planning Authority for its approval. The plan shall detail: \r\n(i) The hours during which development works will occur (please refer to COPA 74 for maximum permitted working hours). These must take in to account school times and HGVs should only access the site between 9:30AM and 3PM during operational term time. \r\n(ii) A programme to demonstrate that the most valuable or potentially contaminating materials and fittings can be removed safely and intact for later re-use or processing.\r\n(iii) Traffic management and access arrangements (vehicular and pedestrian) and parking provisions for contractors during the development process (including measures to reduce the numbers of demolition/construction vehicles accessing the site during peak hours).\r\n(iv) The storage of demolition/construction materials on site.\r\n \r\nThe approved details shall be implemented and maintained throughout the duration of the demolition and construction process.  \r\n\r\nREASON: In the interests of public safety and to ensure a minimal effect on the amenities of neighbouring premises and the transport network, in accordance with policies DM1 and DM43 of the Councils Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013).",
    "Condition : 4 - PRIOR TO DEMOLITION, a logistics plan shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority. This shall including the type of HGVs being used, their sizes, and a swept path analysis showing entry and exit from the access.  \r\n\r\nREASON: In the interests of public safety and to ensure a minimal effect on the amenities of neighbouring premises and the transport network, in accordance with policies DM1 and DM43 of the Councils Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013).",
    "Condition : 5 - There shall be no waiting of HGVs on Marsh Lane. \r\n\r\nREASON: In the interests of public safety and to ensure a minimal effect on the amenities of neighbouring premises and the transport network, in accordance with policies DM1 and DM43 of the Councils Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013).",
    "Condition : 6 - The demolition referred to in this application shall take place within five years of the date of this decision.\r\n\r\nREASON: In accordance with the conditions of Schedule 2, Part 11 of the Town and Country (General Permitted Development) Order 2015.",
    "Condition : 7 - The proposed demolition shall be carried out in accordance with the following details provided with this application, and in accordance with the additional information required by conditions 1-4. \r\n\r\nLocation Plan Drawing No. Figure 1 Rev P2; Planning and Demolition Method Statement reference 19143/SH/jc; Letter dated 19th March 2020; Copy of Site notice.\r\n\r\nREASON: In accordance with the conditions of Schedule 2, Part 11 of the Town and Country (General Permitted Development) Order 2015."
