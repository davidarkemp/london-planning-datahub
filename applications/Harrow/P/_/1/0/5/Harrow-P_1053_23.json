    "Reason : 1 - The proposed side extension by reason of its excessive scale and site coverage would result in an unacceptable, incongruous, out of scale overdevelopment of the site, which is in excess of what the site can comfortably accommodate and which fails to reflect the broader pattern of development in the area. Additionally, the proposal would significantly reduce the amount of available private external amenity space for the existing/ future occupiers of this dwelling and by reason of its proximity to the site boundary would unduly impact upon the outlook from the habitable room windows, thereby unduly compromising the ability of its occupiers to use and enjoy the rear garden and failure to provide adequate outlook to the detrimental of the residential amenities of this dwelling.  The development is therefore contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies D3.D(1), D3.D(7) and D3.D(11) of The London Plan (2021), Policy CS.1B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 of the Development Management Plan Local Policies (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010)."
