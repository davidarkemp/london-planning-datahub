    "Reason : 1 - The proposed double sided hip to gable roof extension, front dormers, rear dormers, single storey rear extension and creation of the resulting crown roof by reason of their combined bulk, massing, siting, unsatisfactory design, and poor assimilation with the original dwellinghouse, results in an unsympathetic, incongruous, bulky, unduly prominent, top heavy and contrived form of development that fails to respect the character, composition and design of the host dwelling, and unduly detracts from visual amenity afforded along the street scene. Furthermore, by virtue of its uncharacteristic use of a second front access door, the proposed single storey side extension would result in the extended dwellinghouse appearing unduly at odds with the established pattern of development along the road. The proposal would thereby be contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D3.D(1) and D3.D(11) of The London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 A, DM1 B. (a), (b), and (c) of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed ground floor rear extension, hip to gable roof extensions, resulting crown roof and rear dormers; by reason of their excessive combined bulk and massing, excessive rearward projection and siting in relation to the adjacent rear facing dining room doors of No. 31 Derwent Avenue, would result in loss of outlook and give rise to overbearing visual impact in respect to the No. 31 Derwent Avenue's adjacent rear facing dining room doors. The proposed development would thereby be contrary to policy D3.D(7) of The London Plan (2021), policy DM1 D (e) and (f) of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010)."
