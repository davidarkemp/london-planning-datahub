    "Reason : 1 -  The proposed enlargements to the property by reason of their overall scale and bulk, would form a dominant, inappropriate and incongruous form of development, which would substantially harm the form and proportions of the host dwelling, detracting from the visual amenity of the site and the surrounding area, contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D3.D(1) and D3.D(11) of The London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013), and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed single storey side extension, by reason of its excessive width, siting and site coverage and poor design would introduce an incongruous, overly dominant, bulky and disproportionate form of development that would fail to respect the scale, character and appearance of the host dwellinghouse and that of the surrounding neighbouring properties, to the detriment of the character and appearance of the host dwellinghouse and the prevailing pattern of development in the locality and street scene, contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policies D3 (1), (11) and (12) of The London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed side dormer to first floor rear extension, by reason of its mass, bulk and prominent siting, would give rise to a visually obtrusive and incongruous form of development that would be harmful to the character and appearance of the subject dwelling and the local area, contrary to the high quality design aspirations set out in the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policy D3.D (11) of The London Plan (2021), policy CS1.B on the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), policy DM1 of the Development Management Local Plans Policies (2013) and adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).\r\n\r\n"
