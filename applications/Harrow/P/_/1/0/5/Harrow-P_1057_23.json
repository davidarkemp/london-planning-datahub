    "Reason : 1 - The proposed single storey front extension would be out of keeping with the pattern of development in the locality and the resulting appearance would be distinctly at odds with other properties in the street. The proposed front extension would not sympathetically relate to or harmonise with the style, scale or proportions of the original dwelling and the character of the area. The proposal is therefore contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D3 (D(1) and (11)) of The London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 A, DM1 B (a), (b) and (c) of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed front extension, by reason of its design and layout would block the outlook and light to the habitable room window serving the lounge, to the detriment of the residential amenities of the existing and future occupiers of the site, contrary to Policy D3 (D(7)) of The London Plan (2021) and Policy DM1 C, DM1 D (f) and (g) of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013)."
