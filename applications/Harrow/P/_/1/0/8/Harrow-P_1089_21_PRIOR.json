    "Reason : 1 - The proposal fails to provide floor plans indicating the positions and dimensions of windows along with the elevations of the dwellinghouses as required by paragraph W (2)(bc) of Part 3, Schedule 2 of The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development)(England) Order 2015 as amended.   In the absence of adequate elevations and positions of the windows and together with the inaccurate representation of the existing elevations set out in daylight and Sunlight Report, insufficient information exists for the Local Planning Authority to make a determination as to whether the proposal would result in unacceptable impact in terms of natural light on the future occupiers of the site. The proposal cannot therefore be determined to be in compliance with condition O.2(e) of Class O, Part 1, of Schedule 2 of The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development)(England) Order 2015 as amended and would fail to meet the provisions of paragraph W (2)(bc) of Part 3, Schedule 2 of The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development)(England) Order 2015 as amended.\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposal would include operational development, specifically relating to the proposed pedestrian/cycle ramp, cycle stores and rooflights would therefore not be within the limitations  of Class O, Part 3, Schedule 2 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development (England) Order 2015, as amended which only specifically relates to the change of use of a building and any land within its curtilage. Consequently, in the absence of the proposed pedestrian and cycle ramp, the proposal would give rise to highway safety concerns contrary to paragraphs 108 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2019) and would fall to deliver a sustainable form of development. \r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - In the absence of an adequate Flood Risk Assessment with accurate flood data and emergency planning details, the development has failed to demonstrate that it would be resilient and resistant to the risk of flooding within the site and elsewhere, to the detriment of the existing users of the site, adjacent neighbours and future occupiers. The proposal cannot therefore be determined to be in compliance with condition O.2(c) of Class O, Part 1, of Schedule 2 of The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development)(England) Order 2015 as amended.\r\n",
    "Reason : 4 - In the absence of an adequate Noise Impact Assessment, insufficient information exists for the Local Planning Authority to make a determination as to whether the proposal would result in unacceptable impact in terms of noise on the future occupiers of the site from the adjoining railway. The proposal cannot therefore be determined to be in compliance with provision O.2 (1)(d) of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development (England) Order 2015, as amended.\r\n"
