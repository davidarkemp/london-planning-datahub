    "Reason : 1 - The proposed enlargement would be attached to an existing two storey rear extension that would be within two metres of the boundary of the curtilage of the dwellinghouse and the height of the eaves of the total enlargement, including the existing two storey rear extension would exceed 3 metres. The proposal would therefore not be within the tolerances of Schedule 2, Part 1, Class A, A.1 (i) and (ja) of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 as amended."
