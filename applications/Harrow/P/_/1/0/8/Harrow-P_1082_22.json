    "Reason : 1 - The proposed single storey side to rear extension by reason of its unacceptable height and inappropriate design, would appear as an incongruous and visually obtrusive addition to the host dwellinghouse and the wider street scene that would fail to preserve or enhance the character and appearance of the Pinner Hill Estate Conservation Area. As such, the development would adversely affect character and appearance of the Conservation Area, contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policies D3 (D(1) and D(11)), HC1 of The London Plan (2021), policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), policies DM1, and DM7 of the Development Management Policies Local Plan 2013, the adopted Supplementary Planning Document Residential Design Guide (2010) and the Pinner Hill Conservation Area Management Strategy (2009). \r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed gate and gate piers by reason of its unacceptable height, solid appearance and inappropriate design and excessive scale, would appear as an incongruous and visually obtrusive addition to the street scene that would fail to preserve or enhance the character and appearance of the Pinner Hill Estate Conservation Area, the Special Character Area and harm the openness of the Green Belt. As such, the development would have a detrimental impact upon the open character of this part of the Green Belt by being an inappropriate addition, and would adversely affect character and appearance of the Conservation Area and Special Character Area, contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policies D3 (D(1) and D(11)), G2 and HC1 of The London Plan (2021), policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), policies DM1, DM6,  DM7 and DM16 of the Development Management Policies Local Plan 2013, the adopted Supplementary Planning Document Residential Design Guide (2010) and the Pinner Hill Conservation Area Management Strategy (2009). \r\n"
