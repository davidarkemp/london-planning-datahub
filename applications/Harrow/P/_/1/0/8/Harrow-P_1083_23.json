    "Reason : 1 - The proposal, by reason of their additional height and the siting of the dwellinghouses at higher land levels in relation to the neighbouring properties to the north, would represent an overbearing, visually dominant and obtrusive form of development, which would result in loss of light and outlook, and overshadowing to the dwellings to the north of the sites, to the detriment of the residential and visual amenity of the adjacent occupiers, contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021). Policy D3.D.7 of the London Plan (2021), Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the  adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010) ."
