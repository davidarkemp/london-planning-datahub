    "Reason : 1 - The proposed single storey rear extension, by reason of it's excessive bulk and massing and proximate siting in relation to No. 29 Crown Street's rear garden and ground floor rear facing habitable room fenestration, would appear overly prominent and would unduly restrict outlook and visual amenity afforded to the rear garden and aforementioned rear facing habitable room fenestration serving this neighbouring property. The proposed extension would also create an unacceptable sense of enclosure in respect to No. 29 Crown Street's rear garden. The proposal would thereby be contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D3.D(7) of The London Plan (2021), Policies DM1 C, DM1 D (d), (e) and (f) of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013), and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).\r\n"
