    "Reason : 1 - The proposed relocated bin and cycle stores, due to their proposed siting within the front garden would be unsightly, incongruous and out of keeping, and would reduce the opportunities for soft landscaping resulting in a detrimental impact to the character and appearance of the host site, the wider streetscape and would fail to enhance the character and appearance of the surrounding Conservation Area. The proposal is therefore contrary to the high-quality design aspirations of The National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policies D3 (D(1) and D(11)) and HC1 of The London Plan (2021), policy CS1 of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), policies DM1, DM7, DM22 and DM23 of The Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the Moss Lane Conservation Area Appraisal and Management Strategy (2009). ",
    "Reason : 2 - The development fails to adequately demonstrate that the potential harm to the existing tree at the southern corner of the site frontage and the potential harm on the existing boundary hedge and vegetation is outweighed by the wider public benefits of the proposal, fails to secure net biodiversity gain and additionally has potential for adverse impact on streetside greenery, contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy G6 of The London Plan (2021), Policy CS1 of Harrowï¿½s Core Strategy (2012) and Policies DM20, DM21, DM22 and DM23 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013)."
