    "Reason : 1 - The existing entrance piers and the proposed timber gates, by reason of their height, form and siting, give rise to an incongruous and obtrusive form of development which fails to respond positively to local context and fails to preserve the significance and special character of the Stanmore Hill Conservation Area. There is not clear and convincing justification for the harm, nor public benefits to outweigh this harm. The development is therefore contrary to the requirements of paragraphs 197, 199, 200 and 202 of NPPF (2021), Policies D3.D (1), D3.D (11) and HC1 of The London Plan (2021), Policies CS1.B and CS1.D of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policies DM1 and DM7 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013), the Adopted Supplementary Planning Document Residential Design Guide (2010) and the Stanmore Hill Conservation Area Appraisal and Management Strategy (2013)."
