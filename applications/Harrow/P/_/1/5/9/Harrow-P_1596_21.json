The application therefore fails to accord with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy T7 of the London Plan (2021), and Policy DM44 of the Development Management Policies Plan (2013).\r\n\r\nFor all the reasons considered above, and weighing up the development plan policies and proposals, and other material considerations including comments received in response to notification and consultation as set out above: the details of this application are hereby refused. \r\n"
