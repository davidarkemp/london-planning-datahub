    "Reason : 1 - The proposal to remove the Condition 4 of the original planning permission P/1629/11 would, by reason of the potential retail use and greater flexibility of uses within Use Class E in conjunction with their footfall and operational activities, give rise to unreasonable levels of general disturbance for existing occupiers of nearby residential properties at Mayfield Avenue and Willcourt Avenue, contrary to policies D3 D (7), D13 and D14 of The London Plan (2021) and policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan 2013.",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed removal of Condition 4 of the original planning permission P/1629/11, by reason of the buildings siting to the rear of the existing shopping parade which forms part of the Kenton Local Centre would result in a potential harmful impact on the viability and vitality of the existing retail units within the Local Centre and would result in an inappropriate backland relationship with the existing commercial units.  The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policies DM35 and DM40 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013)."
