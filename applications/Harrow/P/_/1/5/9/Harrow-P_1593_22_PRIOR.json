    "Reason : 1 - The proposed demolition of the existing conservatory constitutes development within the meaning of Section 55 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended) and therefore requires planning permission and would fall outside  of the tolerances set out by Part 1, Schedule 2 Class A.1(g) of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development (England) Order 2015, as amended.",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposal, by reason of its rearward projection, would be detrimental to the amenities of the neighbouring occupier at no. 41 Kingsfield Avenue, contrary to Policy D3.D (7) of the London Plan (2021), Policy DM1 of the Development Management Policies Local Plan document (2013) and the relevant provisions of the adopted Harrow Supplementary Planning Document Residential Design Guide (2010)."
