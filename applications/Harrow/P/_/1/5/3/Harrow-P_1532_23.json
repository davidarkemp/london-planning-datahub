    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development by reason of the external alterations including the introduction of an additional entrance door within the existing side extension would appear at odds with the character and appearance of the dwellinghouse and surrounding pattern of development within the immediate area. As such, the development would be contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D3.D.11 of The London Plan (2021), DM1 of the Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed flat, by reason of the internal layout in relation to the living, dining and kitchen area served by a small window within the front wall and in conjunction with failure to demonstrate that 75% of the internal floor to ceiling height of the flat would exceed 2.5m would result in an inadequate level of light to this area and would create a cramped and poor standard of living accommodation for future occupiers to the detriment of the residential amenities of the potential future occupiers of the flat. The proposal is therefore contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies D3.D.7 and D6 of The London Plan (2021),Policies DM1 and DM26 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013), the Mayor of London Supplementary Planning Guidance (2016) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed development by reason of the awkward shape and size of the private garden space would fail to provide a useable and adequate private amenity space for the proposed ground floor flat and would result in a substandard quality of living accommodation to the detriment of the residential amenities of future occupiers of the residential unit contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021),  policies D3.D.7 and D6 of The London Plan (2021), policies DM1, DM26 and DM27 of the Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 4 - The proposal by reason of the siting and storage of 6 refuse and waste facilities within the forecourt would result in visual clutter and poor standard of development to the detriment of the character and appearance of the host building and streetscene and residential amenities of the future occupiers of the flat, contrary to policies DM1, DM26 and DM45 of the Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 5 - The proposal, by reason of the rear openings of the self contained flat being within close proximity to the garden boundary fence, would result in poor outlook, loss of light and an increased sense of enclosure and would create a poor standard of living accommodation for future occupiers to the detriment of their residential amenity, contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies D3.D.7 and D6 of The London Plan (2021), Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013), the adopted Supplementary Planning Document Residential Design Guide (2010)."
