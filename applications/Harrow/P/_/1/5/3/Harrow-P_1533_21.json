    "Reason : 1 - By reason of the fact that the site is located within an area of land liable to flooding, and insufficient information has been provided within the submitted Flood Risk Assessment to in relation to; compensatory flood storage and  drainage details relating to surface and foul water connections and their outfall details, the applicant has failed to demonstrate that the proposed development would not exacerbate the risk of flooding within the site or increase the risk and consequences of flooding elsewhere. The proposal would thereby be contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy SI 12 C and SI 13 of the London Plan (2021), Policy CS1.U and CS1.W of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM9 A (a), (b) and (c) and DM10 A, C and D of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013)"
