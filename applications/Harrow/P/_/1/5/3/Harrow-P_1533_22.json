    "Reason : 1 - The proposed two storey side to rear extension by reason of its siting and cumulative excessive bulk, mass, scale and inappropriate design, inconjunction with the existing end gable would result in a bulky, obtrusive and incongruous addition which would fail to be be subservient to the original dwellinghouse. It would fail to respect the character and proportions of the dwellinghouse and the visual amenities of the area and is therefore contrary to the high design aspirations of The National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policies D3 (D(1) and D(11)) of The London Plan (2021), policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), policies DM1.A and DM1.B of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed front porch which adjoins the existing bay window is of poor design and would result in an incongruous addition which would dominate the front elevation of the property, and would fail to reflect the form and character of the original dwellinghouse and the street scene. The proposal is therefore contrary to the high quality design aspirations of The National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policies D3 (D(1) and D(11)) of The London Plan (2021), policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), policies DM1.A and DM1.B of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed single storey side extension by reason of its height, depth and chamfered design adjacent to the side boundary of the site, which is in a highly visible location, would result in an incongruous and unduly prominent addition which would fail to reflect the form and character of the street scene. The proposal is therefore contrary to the high quality design aspirations of The National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policies D3 (D(1) and D(11)) of The London Plan (2021), policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), policies DM1.A and DM1.B of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010)."
