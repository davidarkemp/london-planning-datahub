As such, the proposal has have failed to demonstrate that it would contribute to Secured by Design principles, achieve a high standard of quality appropriate to the character of the locally listed building, or ensure that the development does not unduly impact on the biodiversity potential of the site, contrary to policies D3, D11, HC1, and G6 of The London Plan (2021), policy CS1.B/D of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), and policies DM1, DM2, DM7 and DM20 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013).\r\n"
