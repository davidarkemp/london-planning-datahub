    "Reason : 1 - The proposed rear extension, by reason of its reward projection would result in bulky incongruous extension which would harm the character and appearance of the host dwelling and the Roxeth Hill Conservation Area contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policies D3 (D(1) and D(11)) and HC1 of The London Plan (2021), policies CS1.B and CS1.D of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), policies DM1 and DM7 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013), the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010) and Roxeth Hill Conservation Area Appraisal and Management Strategy.\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposal, by reason of its rearward projection and siting, would be overbearing and visually obtrusive and would be detrimental to the amenities of the neighbouring occupiers at No 47 Roxeth Hill, due to a loss of outlook, contrary to Policy DM1 of the Development Management Policies Local Plan document (2013) and the relevant provisions of the adopted Harrow Supplementary Planning Document Residential Design Guide (2010). \r\n"
