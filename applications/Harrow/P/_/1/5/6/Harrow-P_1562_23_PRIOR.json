    "Reason : 1 - The proposed solar panels on the roof of the Canon Sport Centre and Performing Arts Centre, by reason of their siting and overall roof coverage, and insufficient information to demonstrate their impact on the character and appearance and amenity of the Canons Park Conservation Area and Historic Park and Garden respectively, would be unduly obtrusive and would cause harm to the setting of the special character and appearance of the Canons Park Conservation Area and the special interest of the grade II listed registered park and garden, contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policies D3 D (1), (11) and HC1 of the London Plan (2021), policies CS 1 B and D of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), policies DM1 and DM7 of the Harrow Development Management Polices Local Plan (2013), and the Canons Park Estate Conservation Area Appraisal and Management Strategy.",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposal has failed to demonstrate that the solar PV equipment or solar thermal equipment must, as far as practicable, be sited to minimise its effect on the external appearance of the building and the amenity of the area.  The proposal is therefore not within the tolerances of Schedule 2, Part 14, Class J, J.4 (1) (a) of the Town and Country Planning General Permitted Development (England) Order 2015 (as amended)"
