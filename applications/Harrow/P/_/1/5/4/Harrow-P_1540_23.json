    "Reason : 1 - The proposed first floor side to rear element of the proposed two storey side to rear extension together with the proposed side dormer by reason their combined scale, bulk and design would subsume the original catslide roof and result in the loss of original features, and as a result detracting from the character and appearance of the existing dwelling and the pair of semi-detached properties that this property forms part of, to the detriment of the character and appearance of the host dwelling and the semi-detached pair of dwellings. The proposal is therefore contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D3 ((D1) and D(11)) of The London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1 (B) of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed first floor side extension, by reason of its bulk and siting forward of the neighbouring dwellinghouse at No.53 West End Avenue  would result in the loss of outlook and sense of enclosure to the nearest first floor front window serving a habitable room of this neighbouring dwelling, to the detriment of the residential amenities of the neighbouring occupiers of No.53 West End Avenue. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy D3(D(7)) of The London Plan (2021), policy DM 1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010)."
