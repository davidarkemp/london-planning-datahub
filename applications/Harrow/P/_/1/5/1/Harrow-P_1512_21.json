    "Reason : 1 - The proposed hip to gable and rear dormer roof extensions by reason of their combined bulk, massing, unsatisfactory design and poor assimilation with the existing rear crown roof extension result in an unsympathetic, incongruous, bulky, visually cluttered and contrived form of development that fails to respect the character, composition and design of the host dwelling and prevailing pattern of development in the area. By reason of their prominent siting and excessive bulk and massing, the proposed hip to gable roof extensions would appear as unduly overbearing and obtrusive when viewed along the street scene. The proposal would thereby be contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), Policy D3.D(1) and D3.D(11) of The  London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 B. (a) and (b) of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010)."
