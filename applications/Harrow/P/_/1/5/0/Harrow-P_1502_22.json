    "Reason : 1 - The proposed first floor rear extension would be attached to the dwellinghouse with an unlawful single storey rear extension, which is an unauthorised development with no prior planning permission. The proposed development is therefore contrary to the provisions of The Town and Country Planning Act (1990) as amended, and the necessary considerations afforded by the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D3 D (11) of The London Plan (2021), Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 2 - The flat roof of the proposed first floor rear extension, by reason of its incompatible roof design with the main roof of the dwellinghouse, would give rise to a visually obtrusive and incongruous form of development that would be harmful to the character and appearance of the subject dwelling and the local area, contrary to the high quality design aspirations set out in the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policy D3.D (11) of The London Plan (2021), policy CS1.B on the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), policy DM1 of the Development Management Local Plans Policies (2013) and adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed rear extension on first floor is considered by virtue of its size and siting to result in an unreasonable degree of impact in terms of bulk, proximity to boundaries, loss of light and overshadowing to no.48  Risingholme Road. Accordingly, the proposal would be contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D3 D (1) and (11) of the London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010)."
