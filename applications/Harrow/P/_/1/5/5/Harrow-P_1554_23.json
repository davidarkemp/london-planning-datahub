    "Reason : 2 - The proposed two storey side extension, by reason of its excessive scale, poor design and setting within the Locally Listed Pinner Memorial Park, and the former grounds of the Locally Listed West House would result in a bulky and obtrusive addition which would fail to preserve the setting and openness of the Locally Listed Pinner Memorial Park and West House, contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023), Policies D3 (D(1) and (11)) and HC1 of The  London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policies DM1 and DM7 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010)."
