    "Reason : 1 - The proposed two storey rear extension, by reason of its excessive rearward projection and expansive crown roof, would give rise to an unsympathetic, incongruous, bulky, obtrusive and contrived form of development which would fail to respect the character, composition and design of the host and neighbouring properties, and would significantly detract from the prevailing pattern of development in the area and subsume the host dwelling, to the detriment of the character and appearance of the subject dwellinghouse and the street scene, contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2019),  Policy D3 D (1) and (11) of the London Plan (2021) Core Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010)."
