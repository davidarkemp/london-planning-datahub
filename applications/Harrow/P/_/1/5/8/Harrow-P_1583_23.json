    "Reason : 1 - The proposed single storey rear extension, injected damp proof course and internal layout alterations would harm the special interest of the listed building through harm to historic character and fabric. There is not clear and convincing justification for this harm, nor public benefits to outweigh them. There is otherwise insufficient information to assess aspects of the proposals. The proposals therefore conflict with the requirements of NPPF: National Planning Policy Framework (March 2021) paragraphs 197, 199, 200, 202, 205; the London Plan policy HC 1C; Development Management Local Plan Policy DM7 part E (May 2013), the Harrow Core Strategy policy CS1, and the guidance contained within the Planning Practice Guidance for Conserving and Enhancing the Historic Environment (updated July 2021); Historic England Advice Note 2: 'Making Changes to Heritage Assets' (adopted 25th February 2016); Historic England's 'Managing Significance in Decision-Taking in the Historic Environment Historic Environment Good Practice Advice in Planning: 2' (published 2015); DCMS document Principles of Selection for Listed Buildings November 2018 and Historic England's 'Practical Building Conservation' 2014."
