    "Reason : 1 - The proposed single storey side to rear extension and associated raised patio, by reason its rearward projection and siting, would give rise to a visually overbearing form of development upon the neighbouring occupiers of No.12 Trevone Gardens and raised patio would allow for an unreasonable degree of overlooking of both neighbouring gardens, to the detriment of the amenities of the neighbouring occupiers at No.12 and No.16 Trevone Gardens. The proposed development is therefore contrary to Policy D3(D(7)) of The London Plan (2021), policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010)."
