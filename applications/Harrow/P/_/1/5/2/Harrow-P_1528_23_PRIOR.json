    "Reason : 1 - The drawings show an extended roof design feature extending beyond 6m depth. The development is therefore outside of the tolerances. The developer has therefore provided inaccurate information to comply with condition A.4(2)(a) of development permitted by Class A.1(g)  of Part 1, Class A (of Schedule 2) of The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015, as amended and would therefore fail to demonstrate that the development would comply with the tolerances set out under Class A.1(g), A.1(f)(ii) and A.1(i) of Class A, Part 1 (of Schedule 2) of The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015, as amended",
    "Reason : 2 - The drawings show a raised platform which exceeds 0.3m in height. The development would therefore not comply with the tolerances set out under Class A.1(k)(i) of Class A, Part 1 (of Schedule 2) of The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015, as amended",
    "Reason : 3 - Notwithstanding reasons for refusal 1 and 2, the proposal, by reason of its rearward projection, siting and provision of a raised platform would be detrimental to the amenities of the neighbouring occupiers at No.1 Gerard Road, contrary to Policy DM1 of the Development Management Policies Local Plan document (2013) and the relevant provisions of the adopted Harrow Supplementary Planning Document Residential Design Guide (2010)"
