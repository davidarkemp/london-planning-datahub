    "Reason : 1 - The first floor flat, by reason of its shortfall in the minimum total gross internal floor area and the lack of designated storage area, together with the lack of details to demonstrate that at least 75 per cent of the habitable floor area would meet the minimal floor to ceiling height of 2.3 metres, would result in an overall cramped and substandard quality of living accommodation for the future occupiers of the flat and would fail to provide a fit for purpose residential unit of an appropriate design, quality and layout, contrary to Policies D3.D(7) and D6 of The London Plan (2021), policies DM1 (D.(g)) and DM26 (A.(a) and (c))  of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013), the Technical Housing Standards Nationally Described Space Standards (2015), the Mayor of London Supplementary Planning Guidance (2016), and the adopted Residential Design Guide Supplementary Planning Document (2010).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed division of the outdoor rear amenity space together with the proposed rear conservatory, by reason of its unacceptable layout comprising the first floor flat�s rear amenity space located adjacent to the rear facing windows of the ground floor flat�s proposed conservatory would result in the loss of privacy to the ground floor flat and would permit direct overlooking from the ground floor flat to the rear garden of the first floor flat, to the detriment of the residential amenities of the future occupiers of the development, contrary to Policy D3(D.7) of The London Plan (2021), Policies DM1(C and D) and DM26(A.(d) and B) of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Residential Design Guide Supplementary Planning Document (2010).",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed bedroom 2 of the ground floor flat when considered with the proposed rear conservatory, by reason of its poor layout would fail to provide adequate outlook for this bedroom and would result in a substandard quality of living accommodation for the future occupiers of the ground floor flat, contrary to Policy D3(D.7) of The London Plan (2021), Policies DM1(D.(f)) and DM26(A.(d)) of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Residential Design Guide Supplementary Planning Document (2010"
