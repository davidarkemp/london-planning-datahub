    "Reason : 1 - The occupancy and internal layout shown on the submitted drawings are inaccurate and do not reflect that of existing site circumstances. Therefore the Local Planning Authority is unable to make a fully informed and comprehensive assessment of the impact or otherwise of the proposed development in relation to the character and appearance of the area and impacts to residential amenities of occupier of the flats, contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies D3 and D6 of The London Plan (2021), CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policies DM1 and DM26 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 2 - Notwithstanding the above, the proposal, by reason of the shortfall in the minimum gross internal floor space and bedroom standards for flat B, the lack of primary windows serving the bedroom, its poor and unsatisfactory layout and stacking arrangement would result in a cramped and poor quality of living accommodation for existing and future occupiers and would fail to provide adequate provision of light and outlook, transmission of noise/general disturbance between the flats. The proposal is therefore contrary to the Policies D3.D(7) and D6 of The London Plan (2021), Policies DM1 and DM26 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document Residential Design Guide (2010). ",
    "Reason : 3 - Notwithstanding the above, the single storey side extension, by reason of its width resulting in the loss of the pre-existing side access to the rear of the site, would prevent satisfactory access between the forecourt and rear gardens for the flats, impinging upon their functionality, and resulting in visual clutter associated with the location of the refuse/waste storage in the forecourt, and undermining the provision of fit for purpose, secure and well-located cycle parking, to the detriment of the appearance of the street scene. The proposal would therefore fail to comply with high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy CS1B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policies D3 and T5 of the London Plan (2021), Policies DM1, DM23 and DM42 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Harrow Supplementary Planning Document Residential Design Guide (2010)."
