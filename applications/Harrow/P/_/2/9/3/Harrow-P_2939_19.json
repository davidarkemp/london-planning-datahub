    "Reason : 1 - The Local Planning Authority is not satisfied that consistent evidence has been provided to demonstrate that, on the balance of probabilities, the single-family dwellinghouse at 73 Peel Road, Wealdstone, Harrow, HA3 7QX has been in use as 4 self-contained flats for a continuous period of at least 4 years prior to the date of this application. The existing development is therefore considered to be unlawful and as such the Local Planning Authority refuse to issue a Certificate of Lawful Existing Development."
