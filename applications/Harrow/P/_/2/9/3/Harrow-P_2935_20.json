    "Reason : 1 - Insufficient information has been submitted in regard to all the external materials to be used in the construction of the extensions and the proposed materials to be used for the front window in order to comprehensively assess the merits of this application and its acceptability in relation to the character and appearance of the locality of the conservation area. Therefore, it has not been demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority that the proposed development would safeguard the appearance of the conservation area and the locality. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies D3 D(12) and HC1 of The London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1(B) of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), policies DM1 and DM7 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document Residential Design Guide (2010)."
