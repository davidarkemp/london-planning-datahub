    "Reason : 1 - The proposed amendments would materially alter the internal layouts of the approved development at ground and first floor level and would result in a significant impact on the overall living accommodation for future occupiers of the host building and would require further consultation and assessment against the Harrow Development Plan. The amendments would therefore require an application for planning permission."
