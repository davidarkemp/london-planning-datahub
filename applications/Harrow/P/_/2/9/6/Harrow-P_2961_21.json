    "Reason : 1 - The proposed extension together with the existing rear dormer and, by reason of their combined excessive scale, bulk and poor design would give rise to a contrived and incongruous form of development and result in excessive and overly dominant extensions which would fail to respect the proportions and scale of the original dwellinghouse. The proposal is contrary to the high quality design aspirations set out in the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policies D3.D(1) and D3.D(11) of The London Plan (2021), policy CS1.B on the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), policy DM1 of the Development Management Local Plans Policies (2013) and adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed first floor extension, by reason of its rearward projection and siting in relation to No.32 Lulworth Gardens would result in loss of outlook and give rise to overbearing visual impact on this neighbouring dwellinghouse, to the detriment of the residential and visual amenities of the occupiers of this neighbouring site, contrary to policy D3.D(7) of The London Plan (2021), policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010)."
