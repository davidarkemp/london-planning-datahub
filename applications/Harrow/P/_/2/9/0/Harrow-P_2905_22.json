    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development, by reason of incongruous and contrived design, resulting from the disproportionate width of the two storey side extension and siting close to the side boundary, incompatible roof pitch and introduction of additional front door to the front elevation would fail to provide a coherent pattern of development in the street scene which would harm the form, openness and proportion of the site, relationship with the properties in the locality accentuated by its prominent siting and poor architectural detailing to the detriment of the character and appearance of the streetscene and the pattern of development within the surrounding area and would therefore be contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies D3.D(1) and D3.D(11) of The London Plan (2021), Policy CS.1B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 of the Development Management Plan Local Policies (2013) and the Adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed upper floor unit would fail to meet the required minimum Gross Internal Area (GIA) as required by the London Plan (2021) and would therefore give rise to a substandard and poor quality accommodation to the detriment of the residential amenities of the future occupiers of the flat, contrary to policies D3(7) and D6 of The London Plan (2021), policies DM1 and DM26 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013), the Mayor of London Housing Supplementary Planning Guidance (2016) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Documents Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 3 - The cumulative impact of the excessive number of car parking spaces, refuse bins and poor quality and limited strips of landscaping to the front and side of the property would result in a frontage dominated by hardstanding to the detriment of the character and appearance of the property and the surrounding area, contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policy D3 (D(1) and D(14)) of The London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policies DM1 and DM22 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document Residential Design Guide (2010)."
