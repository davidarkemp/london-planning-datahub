    "Reason : 1 - The proposed front dormer and two storey side to rear extension, by reason of their prominent siting, design and scale, would detract from the original catslide character of the host dwelling and would unbalance the pair of semi-detached dwellings. The proposals would give rise to a contrived roof form that would fail to respect the character, massing, proportion and composition of the host property and the prevailing character and rhythm of development of the neighbouring properties and would introduce a bulky, incongruous, and contrived form of development in the street scene that would subsume the original character and scale of the property, to the detriment of the character and appearance of the existing property on site and the locality, contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the Nation Planning Policy Framework (2019), Policies 7.4B and 7.6B of The London Plan (2016), Core Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed first floor rear extension, by reason of its excessive rearward projection and siting, would result in unacceptable loss of outlook, to the detriment of the residential and visual amenities of the neighbouring occupiers at No.60 Central Avenue, contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), Policy 7.6B of The London Plan (2016), Policy DM1 of the Development Management Policies Local Plan document (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010)."
