    "Reason : 1 - The proposed two storey side to rear extension, by reason of its excessive width at first floor rear, and its attachment to the existing rear dormer window, represents a disproportionate and bulky addition of poor design, which does not reflect the proportions of the subject property, and which detracts from the established pattern of development in the area and the built forms of the original and immediately adjacent properties, contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021, Policy D3 (D(1) and D(11)) of the London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013), and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed conversion of the dwellinghouse into two flats, by reason of the formation of multiple refuse and cycle areas and their siting, would result in an adverse impact on the character and appearance of the subject property and the area. The proposal would therefore fail to meet with the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies D3.D (1) and D3.D (11) of the London Plan (2021), Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Polices Local Plan (2013) and the Residential Design Guide Supplementary Planning Document (2010).",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed first floor side to rear extension, by reason of its siting along the shared boundary with No 27 Bacon Lane, would result in an overbearing impact and unacceptable loss of outlook to the first floor habitable window of No 27 Bacon Lane, to the detriment of the residential amenity of its occupiers . As such the proposal would be contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies D3.D (7) and D3.D (10), and D6.B of the London Plan (2021), Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Polices Local Plan (2013) and the Residential Design Guide Supplementary Planning Document (2010).",
    "Reason : 4 - The proposal, by reason of insufficient single bedroom widths within both flats, insufficient overall gross internal floor area and insufficient floor to ceiling height to the first floor and loft level flat, and the inappropriate stacking relationship between ground floor bedrooms and the upper floor kitchen and living space would fail to provide residential units of an appropriate design and quality, detrimental to the residential amenity of future occupants, and contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies D3.D (7 and 10), D6.B, D6.F (1) D6.F (3), and D6.F (8) of The London Plan (2021), Policies DM1 and DM26, of the Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013), The Technical Housing Standards Nationally Described Space Standards (2015), the Mayor of London Housing Supplementary Housing Document (2016), and the Harrow Adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010)."
