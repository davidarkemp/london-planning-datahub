    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development by reason of its cumulative poor design, excessive width and depth, bulk and roof form(s) in conjunction with its lack of set-backs and prominent siting fails to provide a proportionate, balanced, subordinate and harmonious addition to the host dwellinghouse and introduces an overly dominant, obtrusive, contrived and incongruous form of development that subsumes the rear elevation of the host property and fails to respect the character and appearance of the host dwellinghouse, neighbouring properties and the established and prevailing pattern of development in the locality contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies D3.D(1) and D3.D(11) of The London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1 (B) of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), policy DM 1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013), the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed two storey rear extension, by reason of its siting in relation to the northern site boundary and projection beyond the first floor rear protected window of no. 4 Kenmore Road, would result in a large physical presence and cause a significant loss of outlook and light, to the detriment of the residential amenities of the occupiers of the neighbouring property, contrary to Policy D3.D(7) of The London Plan (2021), Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013), and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document Residential Design Guide (2010)."
