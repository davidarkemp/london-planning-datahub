    "Reason : 1 - The proposal, by reason of the siting and form of the proposed first floor rear extension where it would attach to the existing first floor rear window, and its central position, would create an out of character and poor form of development within the locality which would be detrimental to the visual amenities of the subject dwelling and to the visual amenities of the surrounding area, and which fails to meet the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies D3.D (1) and D3.D (11) of the London Plan (2021), Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Polices Local Plan (2013) and the Residential Design Guide Supplementary Planning Document (2010).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed conversion of the dwellinghouse into two flats, by reason of the formation of multiple refuse and cycle areas and their siting, would result in an adverse impact on the character and appearance of the subject property and the area. The proposal would therefore fail to meet with the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies D3.D (1) and D3.D (11) of the London Plan (2021), Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Polices Local Plan (2013) and the Residential Design Guide Supplementary Planning Document (2010).",
    "Reason : 3 - \r\nThe proposed development, by reason of its undersized floorspace in conjunction with the inappropriate single bedroom sizes, poor layout and outlook and failure to provide private amenity space and the cramped front garden layout with lack of defensible space and the close proximity of the cycle storage to the bedroom windows of Flat 2 overlooking and loss of privacy. As such, the proposal would fail to provide an acceptable standard of accommodation for future occupiers in Flat 1 and 2. The proposal is therefore contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies D3.D (7 and 10), D6.B, and D6.E and D6.F (9) of The London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policies DM1, DM26, DM27 and DM45 of the Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the Mayor of London Housing Supplementary Housing Document (2016), and the Harrow Adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).\r\n",
    "Reason : 4 - The proposal, by reason of insufficient bicycle storage, would fail to contribute to sustainable transport objectives, contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy T5 of the London Plan (2021), and Policy DM 42 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013)."
