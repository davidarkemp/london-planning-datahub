    "Reason : 1 - The proposed extensions by reason of their excessive size, mass, footprint and inappropriate materials would represent an unsympathetic and disproportionate addition to the existing garages which would substantially harm the form, openness and proportion of the site, accentuated by its prominent siting and loss of soft landscaping within the front forecourt to the detriment of the character and appearance and visual amenity of the street scene and host dwelling. The proposal would thereby be contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies D3.D(1),D3.D(11) and G6 of The  London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 A, B. (a) and (d) and DM22 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 2 - By reason of the fact that the proposed development would be sited in close proximity to and result in a loss of, trees and hedges on the eastern boundary of the site as well as its close siting to a tree protected by Tree Preservation Order (TPO), the proposal fails to provide sufficient information to determine its impact on the Root Protection Area (RPA) and incursions on existing trees adjacent to the development site and provide appropriate tree protection measures for retained trees and hedges and therefore the proposal would fail to accord with National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policy G7 of The London Plan (2021) and policy DM22 of the Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) "
