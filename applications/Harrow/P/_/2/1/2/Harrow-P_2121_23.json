    "Reason : 1 - The proposal, by reason of its overall massing, siting, scale would be an unduly bulky, incongruous and poorly designed development which is incongruous in appearance, at odds with the character of the area and the prevailing pattern of development in the streetscene on the corner of Whitmore Road and Porlock Avenue, and would therefore be harmful to the character and appearance of the locality, contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023), Policies D3.D(1) and D3.D(11) of The London Plan (2021), policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), policies DM1 and DM23 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010)."
