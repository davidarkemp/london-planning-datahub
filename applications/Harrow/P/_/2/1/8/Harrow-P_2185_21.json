    "Reason : 1 - The proposal, by reason of the increases in scale, mass, bulk and volume of the replacement dwellinghouse constitutes inappropriate development in the Green Belt and has a harmful impact on the openness and visual amenities of the Green Belt. The applicant has failed to satisfactorily demonstrate that very special circumstances exist to justify inappropriate development and that the harm, by reason of inappropriateness and any other harm, is clearly outweighed by other considerations. The development is therefore  contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy G2 of the London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1(F) of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012) and Policy DM16 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013). ",
    "Reason : 2 - The first-floor side extension, by reason of its reduced ridge height and the variation to the roof profile, by reason of the reduced eaves to ridge height, results in an awkward, squat, incongruous and disjointed roof form that is of poor design and detracts from the character and appearance of the host dwelling and the locality, contrary to the high quality design aspirations of National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D3.D (1 and 11) of the London Plan (2021), Policy CS1B of The Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 of Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document Residential Design Guide (2010)."
