    "Reason : 1 - The first floor rear extension, by reason of its design would fail to reflect the character and appearance of the host dwelling and therefore is of an unsatisfactory form of design and appearance. The proposal therefore results in an incongruous form of development to the detriment of the character and appearance of the host building and wider area, contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D3 (D(1) and D(11)) of The London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1 (B) of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), policy DM 1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010)."
