    "Reason : 1 - The proposed boundary wall, by reason of its insufficient height and inadequate landscaping, would fail to safeguard or enhance the setting of the adjacent Grade II Listed building at No. 1 Halsbury Close or preserve or enhance the character and appearance of the Stanmore Hill Conservation area from the development at 65 Stanmore Hill, to the detriment of the setting and character and appearance of No. 1 Halsbury Close and the Stanmore Hill Conservation Area. In the absence of clear and convincing justification for this harm, nor public benefits to outweigh it, it would be contrary to Sections 66 and 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990, The National Planning Policy Framework (2021) paragraphs 194, 195, 197, 199, 200, 202, 206, policy D3, D.1, D.7, D.11 and policy HC1 C of The London Plan (2021), policy CS1.B and D of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), policies DM 1, DM 7, DM 22, and 23 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the Stanmore Hill Conservation Area Appraisal and Management Strategy.\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed boundary wall, by reason of its insufficient height and inadequate landscaping and siting adjacent to a car park area, would give rise to a loss of privacy and perceived overlooking for the adjacent neighbouring occupiers to the south west, No. 1 and No. 2 Halsbury Close and would fail to mitigate the scale and bulk of the development at No. 65 Stanmore Hill, resulting in a detrimental impact on the visual amenities of the neighbouring occupiers to the south west, contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D3. D,7 of The London Plan (2021), Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document Residential Design Guide (2010)."
