    "Reason : 1 - The proposal demolition of the existing rear garage constitutes development within the meaning of Section 55 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended) and therefore requires planning permission and would fall outside of the tolerances set out by Part 1, Schedule 2 Class A.1(g) of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development (England) Order 2015, as amended.",
    "Reason : 2 - The enlarged part of the dwellinghouse would be sited partially outside the curtilage of the host dwelling. The proposal would therefore not be within the tolerances of Schedule 2, Part 1 (Development within the curtilage of a dwellinghouse) of the of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended)."
