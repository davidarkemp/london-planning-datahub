    "Reason : 1 - The proposed single storey rear extension, by reason of its depth and bulk would result in excessive and overly dominant extension which would fail to respect the proportions and scale of the original building and the prevailing pattern of development in the area The proposal is contrary to the high quality design aspirations set out in the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policies D3.D(1) and D3.D(11) of The London Plan (2021), policy CS1.B on the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), policy DM1 of the Development Management Local Plans Policies (2013) and adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed two-storey side extension, by reason of the lack of set back from the adjacent first floor front wall, would fail to provide a subservient and harmonious addition to the host dwellinghouse. The proposal would therefore be to the detriment of the character and appearance of the existing dwellinghouse, the adjacent dwellings, and the prevailing pattern of development in the locality, contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies D3.D(1) and D3.D(11) of The London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and guidance contained in the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed development, by reason of the size and sitting of the first floor side windows, would result in perceived overlooking, to the detriment of the residential amenities of the occupiers of the neighbouring property at No.54 Blawith Road. As such, the proposed development would be contrary to Policy D3.D (7) of the London Plan (2021), Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and guidance contained in the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010)."
