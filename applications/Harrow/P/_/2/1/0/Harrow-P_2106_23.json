    "Reason : 1 - The proposed use of the dwellinghouse as a House of Multiple Occupancy for up to 6 persons (Use Class C4) would involve, and would in part be facilitated by external alterations through the removal of the existing timber conservatory and extension of the ground floor rear extension in its place. Given the combined 6 metre depth of the existing and proposed rear extension and in the absence of a Prior Approval fallback, the proposal external works would not be in keeping with the requirements of Schedule 2, Part 1 Class A, A.1 (f) of The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended). Given that the proposed conversion would be facilitated through an unauthorised extension, it would fail to be a lawful conversion in line with the tolerances of Class L of Part 3 of Schedule 2 of The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposal is therefore NOT a lawful development."
