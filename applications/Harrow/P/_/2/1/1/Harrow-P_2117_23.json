Furthermore, the proposed details must accord with details as approved in other conditions to permission P/4702/19 dated 18/05/2020, which has not been demonstrated. As such, the proposed details fail to demonstrate that the development makes appropriate provision for the protection, enhancement, and management of biodiversity within the site and surrounding area, in accordance with policy G6 of The London Plan (2021) and policies DM20, DM21 and DM22 of the Harrow Development Management Polices Local Plan (2013)."
