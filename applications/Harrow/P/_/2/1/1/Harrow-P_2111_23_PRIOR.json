    "Reason : 1 - The submitted proposed drawings, shows a front porch which is not part of the prior approval process under Class A. The proposal would therefore not be within the tolerances of Class A of Part 1, Schedule 2 of The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015, as amended.",
    "Reason : 2 - From the plans submitted, the proposed maximum height and eaves height of the extension shown on the submitted drawings differs to what has been stated on the application form, as such, the local planning authority is therefore unable to make a comprehensive and objective assessment of the proposed development.  The proposal is therefore contrary to A.4(2)(a) and A.4 3(b) to Class A of Part 1 (of Schedule 2) of The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015, as amended."
