    "Reason : 1 - The proposed two storey side to rear extension by reason of its excessive width, bulk, roof form and lack of set-backs with its prominent siting on a corner site, would introduce an incongruous, overly dominant and obtrusive form of development that would fail to respect the balance and proportions of the existing dwellinghouse and the neighbouring property, to the detriment of the character and appearance of the existing dwellinghouse, the neighbouring property and the locality, contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policy D1.D(1) and (11) of The London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1 B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document Residential Design Guide (2010)."
