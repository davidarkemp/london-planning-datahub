    "Reason : 1 - Within the context of planning application P/1273/19 dated 10/05/2019, the proposed amendments would be a material change primarily with regard to the character of the street scene, heritage and impact to highways safety. It would therefore require re-consultation, and the proposal would need to be re-assessed against the requirements of Policy D3 and HC1 and  of The London Plan (2021) and Policy DM1, DM7, DM49 of the Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013). The proposals are therefore not considered to be non-material minor amendments."
