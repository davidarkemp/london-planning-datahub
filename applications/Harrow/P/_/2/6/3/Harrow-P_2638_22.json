    "Reason : 1 - The proposed single storey rear extension in conjunction with the existing rear extension, by reason of its siting and excessive combined rearward projection, would appear as overbearing and visually intrusive with viewed from the rear gardens and ground floor rear facing habitable fenestration of No. 102 and 106 Lynton Road. Furthermore, by reason of the site's orientation and the proposed extension's rearward projection beyond No. 106 Lynton Road, it would result in harmful overshadowing of this neighbouring property's rear garden. The proposed development would thereby be contrary to Policy D3 (7) of the London Plan (2021), Policies DM1 C, DM1 D (d), (e) and (f) of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and guidance contained in the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed single storey rear extension, by reason of it, size, siting, bulk, makeshift appearance and its use of unsympathetic facing materials would form a poor quality addition that would fail to respect the character and appearance of the host building and area in a wider context. The proposal would therefore be contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies D3.D(1) and D3.D(11) of The London Plan (2021), Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policies DM1 A, DM1 B (a), (b) and (c) of the Development Management Plan Local Policies (2013) and the Adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010)."
