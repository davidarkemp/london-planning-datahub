    "Reason : 1 - Within the context of the planning permission P/1783/21 dated 26/07/2021, the proposed development would be significantly different in its design, and would introduce various new elements of development, and result in alterations to the overall massing of the dwellinghouse. The alterations as a whole would result in a material change to the character and appearance of the host dwelling, street scene and wider area, and would also result in a material change in impact on the residential amenities of adjacent neighbours. It would therefore require re-consultation of neighbouring properties, and the proposal would need to be re-assessed against the requirements of Policy D3 of The London Plan (2021) and Policy DM1 of the Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010). The proposal is therefore not considered to be non-material minor amendment."
