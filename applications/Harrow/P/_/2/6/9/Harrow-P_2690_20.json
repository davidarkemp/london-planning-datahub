    "Reason : 1 - The proposed front boundary treatment by reason of its unacceptable design and appearance, excessive height and unsympathetic materials is in stark contrast to the pre-existing boundary treatment and would give rise to an incongruous and obtrusive feature, which would fail to respond positively to the local context, to the detriment of the character and appearance of the area, the streetscene and the Stanmore Hill Conservation Area, contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2019) Policies 7.4 B, 7.6 B, 7.8 C and 7.8 D of The London Plan (2016), Core Policies CS1(B) and (D) of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policies DM 1 and DM 7 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013),the adopted Supplementary Planning Document - Residential Design Guide (2010) and The Stanmore Hill Conservation Area Appraisal and Management Strategy (2013)."
