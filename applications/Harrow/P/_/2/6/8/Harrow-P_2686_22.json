    "Reason : 1 - The proposed roof extension and resultant crown roof together with the proposed single storey front extension and double side dormers  by reason of their combined bulk, massing and unsatisfactory design would result in an incongruous, discordant and ungainly cumulative additions to the dwelling and the side dormers by reason of their excessive size and lack of visual containment would give rise to bulky and dominant additions within the side roofslopes. On this basis, the proposed development would cause detrimental harm to the character and appearance of the host dwelling and the local area, contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D3(D(1) and D(11)) of The London Plan (2021), policy CS1.B of the Core Strategy (2012), policy DM1 of the Development Management Policies (2013), and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).
