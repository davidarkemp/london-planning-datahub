    "Reason : 1 - The proposal, by reason of its prominent location and siting of the building, would fail to respond positively within its context, in relation to the adjoining buildings and would fail to maintain or enhance the character of the street scene and the visual interests of its immediate surroundings. Accordingly, the proposal would fail to meet the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), and would be contrary to Policy D3 (1)(11) of the London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1B of The Harrow Core Strategy 2012, Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies 2013, the adopted Supplementary Planning Document Residential Design Guide 2010 and would not be within the tolerances of Class AA, Part 20, Paragraph AA.2(e) of the General Permitted Development Order (2015) as amended."
