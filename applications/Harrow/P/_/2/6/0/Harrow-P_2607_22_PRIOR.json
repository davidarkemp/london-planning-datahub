    "Reason : 1 - In the absence of proposed section drawings, detailing the internal head height of the proposed unit, the Council cannot be satisfied that the unit would be provided with a sufficient internal head height in line with the minimum internal head height requirements set out within the Department for Communities and Local Government Technical Housing Standards - Nationally Described Space Standards (2015). The proposal would therefore be contrary to paragraph 3(9A)(b) of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) (Amendment) Order 2015 (as amended) and would give rise to substandard and poor quality accommodation to the detriment of the residential amenities of the future occupiers of the unit contrary to the high quality design aspirations of The National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policies D3 D (7) and D6 F (8)  of The London Plan (2021), policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), policies DM1 C and DM1 D (g) of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Residential Design Guide Supplementary Planning Document (2010)."
