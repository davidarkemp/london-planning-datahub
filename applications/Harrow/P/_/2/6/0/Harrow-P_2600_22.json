    "Reason : 1 - The proposed alterations to the roof and fenestration in conjunction with the first floor enlargements by reason of their cumulative poor design, excessive height, bulk and roof form(s) would result in a visually intrusive, unduly bulky, incongruous and contrived form of development, which would subsume and erode the architectural interest and built form of the original detached property and fails to respect the character and appearance of the host dwellinghouse, neighbouring properties and the established and prevailing pattern of development in the locality contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies D3 (D(1) and D3 D(11)) of The London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1 (B) of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), policy DM 1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013), the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed development is located within surface water flood zone 3a and in the absence of a satisfactory Flood Risk Assessment, it has not been demonstrated that the proposed development would not exacerbate the risk of flooding within the site or increase the risk and consequences of flooding elsewhere, contrary to National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy SI 12 of The London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1.U of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012) and Policies DM9 and DM10 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013)."
