    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development, by reason of its bulky, awkward, contrived and unduly complex form, together with its unsympathetic use of balustrades at roof level and prominent visibility from the front of the building, would result in an incongruous and unsympathetic form of development which harmfully clutters the roof of the building, detracts from the visual amenity afforded to the approach to Julian Court, and adversely impacts upon the wider character and setting of the Harrow Park Conservation Area and the Area of Special Character within which the application site is located. Furthermore, through its unacceptable design, the proposed development would result in substantial harm on the heritage value of the site as a locally listed building, Grade II listed building (through its attachment to Julian Hill) and upon the setting of the Bell House as locally listed building and Grade II listed building (also through its attachment to Julian Hill). The proposed development would thereby be contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies D3 D(1), D3 D(11) and Policy HC1 C of the London Plan (2021), Core Policies CS1.B and CS1.D of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policies DM1 A, DM1 B (a), (b) (c), DM6 A DM6 A (a), (b), (c), DM6 C, DM7 A, DM7 B (a), (b), (c), DM7 D, and DM7 E (a) of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013), the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010), the Harrow Park Conservation Area Appraisal and Management Strategy (2008), the Historic England Good Practice Advice in Planning Note 3: The setting of heritage assets (2017), and the Council�s Locally Listed buildings Supplementary Planning Document (2013)."
