    "Reason : 1 - The proposal, by reason of the excessive width, bulk and siting of the ground floor side to rear extension, and excessive width and depth of the proposed rear dormer window and poorly designed ground floor rear extension roof form, would dominate and subsume the proportions of the existing and adjoining dwelling, and would result in a poor form of development which would interrupt the prevailing character of the immediate street scene, contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021, Policy D3 (D(1) and D(11)) of the London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013), and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposal, by reason of the height and siting of the ground floor rear extension and rear dormer window, would appear overbearing and would create an unacceptable degree of overshadowing and loss of outlook for neighbours at No 2 Heather Way, to the detriment of their living conditions and contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies D3.D (7) and D3.D (10) of the London Plan (2021), Policy DM1 of the Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013), and the Adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010)."
