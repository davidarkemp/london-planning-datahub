    "Reason : 1 - The proposed first-floor side extension in conjunction with the existing gable end roof and rear dormer and incongruous first floor roof form, would give rise to an unsympathetic, incongruous, bulky, obtrusive and contrived form of development which would fail to respect the scale, character, massing, composition and design of the host and neighbouring properties, to the detriment of the character and appearance of the subject dwellinghouse and the visual amenities of the area, contrary to the high quality design aspirations of National Planning Policy Framework (2019), Policies D1 and D4 of the 'Intend to Publish' Draft London Plan (2019), Policies 7.4 B and 7.6 B of The London Plan (2016),  Policy CS1B of The Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 of Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document Residential Design Guide (2010)."
