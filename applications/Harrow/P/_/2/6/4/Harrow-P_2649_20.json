    "Reason : 1 - The removal of restrictions with respect to the number of customers within the smoking area (condition 3), would result in unacceptable noise impacts and general disturbance, to the detriment of the residential amenity of the neighbouring occupiers. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policy D14 of the London Plan (2021) and Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013)",
    "Reason : 2 - Inadequate information has been provided regarding the timescale for the implementation of the details submitted in relation to the disposal of sewage water. The proposal therefore fails to accord with Policies SI 5, SI 8, SI 12, SI 13 of the London Plan (2021), Policy CS1 U of the Harrow Core Strategy and Policies DM 9 and DM 10 of the Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013).",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposal fails to demonstrate the details submitted in relation to the disposal of surface water would provide adequate drainage facilities which would reduce and mitigate the effects of flood risk. The proposal would thereby not be in accordance with Policies SI 5, SI 8, SI 12, SI 13 of the London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1 U of the Harrow Core Strategy and Policies DM 9 and DM 10 of the Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013).",
    "Reason : 4 - The proposal fails to demonstrate adequate flood mitigation measures would be provided. The Local Planning Authority are therefore unable to assess whether the proposal would result in adverse flooding impacts. The proposal would thereby fail to accord with Policies SI 5, SI 8, SI 12, SI 13 of the London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1 U of the Harrow Core Strategy and Policies DM 9 and DM 10 of the Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013)."
