    "Reason : 1 - The bedroom and rear outdoor amenity area associated with the new dwelling would be provided with unsatisfactory levels of light and outlook, the study would also be provided with an unsatisfactory level of outlook. Due to the siting of its associated lightwell in relation to the first floor rear facing bedroom window of the HMO directly above, the proposed internal amenity area would be susceptible to harmful overlooking from the first floor rear facing bedroom window of the HMO above. The proposed development would therefore give rise to substandard and poor quality accommodation to the detriment of the residential amenities of the future occupiers of the proposed dwelling contrary to policies D3 D (7), D6 D of The London Plan (2021), Policy AAP4 B of the Harrow and Wealdstone Area Action Plan, Policies DM1 A, DM1 C, DM1 D (b), (f), (i) and DM27 A (e) of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013), the Mayor of London Housing Supplementary Planning Guidance (2016), Department for Communities and Local Government Technical Housing Standards - Nationally Described Space Standards (2015), and the adopted Residential Design Guide Supplementary Planning Document (2010).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed new dwelling, by reason of its height and siting in relation to the first floor rear facing bedroom window of the HMO sited directly above would unduly obscure outlook afforded to the first floor rear facing bedroom window of the HMO above. The proposed development would thereby be contrary to policy D3.D (7) of The London Plan (2021), Policy AAP4 B of the Harrow and Wealdstone Area Action Plan, Policies DM1 C, DM1 D (e) and (f) of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Residential Design Guide Supplementary Planning Document (2010).",
    "Reason : 3 - In the absence of satisfactory detail on proposed refuse and recycling storage arrangements and with no identified refuse and recycling storage being provided for occupants of the HMO to the upper floor levels of the building and the retail unit to the ground floor level of the building, the Council cannot be satisfied that the scheme would provide adequate refuse and recycling storage facilities. Furthermore, in the absence of satisfactory details relating to altered servicing arrangements for the ground floor retail unit of the building, the Council cannot be satisfied that prospective servicing and deliveries for the ground floor retail unit would have an acceptable impact on the safety and flow of traffic along the highway and would adequately protect the amenity of neighbouring occupants. The proposed development would therefore be contrary to Policies T7 G of the London Plan, Policies AAP4 A (j) of the Harrow and Wealdstone Area Action Plan (2013) and Policies DM44 A and DM45 A of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013)."
