    "Reason : 2 - The developer has failed to provide consistent information on the application form and submitted drawings in relation to the maximum eaves height of the proposed development and therefore has failed to provide consistent information required by condition A.4(2) (a) and 3(b) permitted by Class A of Part 1 (to Schedule 2) of The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015."
