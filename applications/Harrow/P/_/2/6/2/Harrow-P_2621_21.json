    "Condition : 3 - The materials to be used in the construction of the external surfaces of the extension hereby permitted shall match those used in the existing building.\nREASON: To safeguard the character and appearance of the area in accordance with Core Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012) and Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013).\n",
    "Condition : 4 - Notwithstanding the provisions of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (or any order revoking and re-enacting that order with or without modification), no window(s)/door(s) shall be installed in the flank elevation(s) of the development hereby permitted without the prior permission in writing of the local planning authority.\nREASON: To safeguard the amenity of neighbouring residents in accordance with Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013).\n",

    "Condition : 9 - Surface water run-off should be controlled as near to its source as possible through a sustainable drainage approach to surface water management (SUDS). SUDS are an approach to managing surface water run-off which seeks to mimic natural drainage systems and retain water on or near the site as opposed to traditional drainage approaches which involve piping water off site as quickly as possible.\r\nSUDS involve a range of techniques including soakaways, infiltration trenches, permeable pavements, grassed swales, ponds and wetlands. SUDS offer significant advantages over conventional piped drainage systems in reducing flood risk by attenuating the rate and quantity of surface water run-off from a site, promoting groundwater recharge, and improving water quality and amenity. Where the intention is to use soakaways they should be shown to work through an appropriate assessment carried out under Building Research Establishment (BRE) Digest 365.\r\nSupport for the SUDS approach to managing surface water run-off is set out in the\r\nNational Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) and its accompanying technical guidance, as well as the London Plan. Specifically, the NPPF (2012) gives priority to the use of sustainable drainage systems in the management of residual flood risk and the technical guidance confirms that the use of such systems is a policy aim in all flood zones. Policy 5.13 of the London Plan (2012) requires development to utilise sustainable drainage systems unless there are practical reasons for not doing so. Sustainable drainage systems cover the whole range of sustainable approaches to surface drainage management. They are designed to control surface water run-off close to where it falls and mimic natural drainage as closely as possible. Therefore, almost any development should be able to include a sustainable drainage scheme based on these principles.\r\nThe applicant can contact Harrow Drainage Section for further information.\r\nReason\r\nTo manage, reduce and mitigate the "
