    "Reason : 1 - The two storey side to rear extension when viewed in conjunction with the existing rear dormer and roof alterations and the existing ground floor rear extension, by reason of the overall excessive cumulative bulk, mass and scale and the resultant poor design, would give rise to a disproportionate addition to the existing dwellinghouse and would introduce a bulky, inappropriate, incongruous and obtrusive form of development that would subsume the character of the existing dwellinghouse and would fail to respect the prevailing pattern of development in the locality, to the detriment of the character and appearance of the host property and the area, contrary to the high quality design aspirations of The National Planning Policy Framework (2019), Policies 7.4B and 7.6B of The London Plan (2016), policies D1 and D2 of the Draft London Plan (2017), Core Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the guidance contained in the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010)."
