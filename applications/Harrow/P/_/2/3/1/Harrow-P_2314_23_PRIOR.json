    "Reason : 1 - The proposal would include operational development, specifically relating to the proposed pedestrian/cycle ramp, cycle stores and rooflights would therefore not be within the limitations  of Class MA, Part 3, Schedule 2 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development (England) Order 2015, as amended which only specifically relates to the change of use of a building and any land within its curtilage. In addition, the proposal relies on development including windows, cycle and bin storage and an access ramp that are not existing on site and do not have planning permission, in order to make the proposal acceptable in terms of amenity, daylight and sunlight to the proposed units and accessibility. Consequently, in the absence of the proposed alterations, the proposal would give rise to poor quality amenity and accessibility, contrary to  paragraphs 130 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023) and would therefore fall to deliver a sustainable form of development. \r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - In the absence of an adequate Flood Risk Assessment with accurate flood data and emergency planning details, the development has failed to demonstrate that it would be resilient and resistant to the risk of flooding within the site and elsewhere, to the detriment of the existing users of the site, adjacent neighbours and future occupiers. The proposal cannot therefore be determined to be in compliance with condition MA.2(c) of Class MA, Part 1, of Schedule 2 of The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development)(England) Order 2015 as amended. \r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed units, by reason of a significant shortfall of overall gross internal floor area of the majority of units, and insufficient information to demonstrate that any of the units meet the minimum require internal heights,  would fail to comply with the nationally described space standards issued by the Department for Communities and Local Government on 27th March 2015. The proposal would therefore be contrary to paragraph 3(9A)(b) of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) (Amendment) Order 2015 (as amended) and would provide an unacceptable standard of residential accommodation for future occupiers contrary to the high quality design aspirations of The National Planning Policy Framework (2023).\r\n",
    "Reason : 4 - The proposal, by reason of inadequate daylight and sunlight provided to some units, as demonstrated by the submitted Daylight/Sunlight Assessment, would give rise to poor quality amenity and standard of living for future occupiers, contrary to  paragraph 130 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023) and would therefore fall to deliver a sustainable form of development.\r\n",
    "Reason : 5 - Notwithstanding the office use of the building, the development relates to land that is designated Industrial and Business Area that is important for providing storage and distribution services and the proposed change of use would have an adverse impact on the sustainability of the services provided by the area, and therefore is considered to be contrary to paragraph 84 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023)\r\n",
    "Reason : 6 - The submitted noise report does not take into consideration the impact of the existing industrial uses on the on future occupiers of the proposed residential use.  Furthermore, no assessment has been made on the acceptability of residential use on adjoining buildings, in the absence of which could give rise to a form of development that could prejudice the viability of existing noise and nuisance generating uses located within this designated Industrial and Business Use Area. Furthermore, the submitted information demonstrates that the proposal would result in unacceptable levels of noise generated by adjacent road and railway uses, and which would require operational works not permitted under Class MA to be made acceptable. The proposal cannot therefore be determined to be in compliance with provision MA.2 (2) d) of Class MA of Part 3 of Schedule 2 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development (England) Order 2015, as amended and is considered to be contrary to paragraphs 174 and 187  of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023)."
