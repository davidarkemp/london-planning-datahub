    "Reason : 1 - The proposed first floor element of the two storey side extension, by reason of its prominent siting, scale and detailed design would be an unduly bulky, incongruous and poorly designed development which is incongruous in appearance, at odds with the established character of the area and the prevailing pattern of development in the street scene. The sites position at a wedge would further exacerbate theses issues and would therefore be harmful to the character and appearance of the locality and the visual amenity of neighbours, contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023), Policies D3.D(1) and D3.D(11) of The London Plan (2021), policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), policies DM1 and DM23 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010)."
