    "Reason : 1 - The proposed first floor rear extension in conjunction with the existing side dormer extension by reason of their cumulative bulk, mass and scale would fail to provide subordinate and harmonious additions to the host dwellinghouse which would result in overly dominant, obtrusive, and incongruous form of development that serves to erode and subsume the character of the original and existing dwellinghouse, contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D3.D(1) and (11) of the London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010)."
