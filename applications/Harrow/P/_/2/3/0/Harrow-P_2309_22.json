    "Reason : 1 - The proposed first floor side to rear extension by reason of its cumulative poor design and the excessive depth of the first floor rear element of the extension, in conjunction with its prominent corner siting would result in an unneighbourly, dominant and incongruous form of development and an uncharacteristic loss of openness to the spatial setting of the locality, as well as resulting in an overbearing impact and perceived over looking of the front garden of no.10 Tintagel Drive,  to the detriment of the character and appearance of the existing dwellinghouse and the area, and the residential amenity of the occupiers of the adjacent dwelling, no. 10 Tintagel Drive  contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D3.D(1), (7) and (11) of The London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1 B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document Residential Design Guide (2010)."
