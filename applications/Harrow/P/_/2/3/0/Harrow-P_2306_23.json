    "Reason : 1 - The proposal by reason of the rear dormer not being fully contained within the rear roof slope, and the failure to demonstrate the materials used in the facing side elevations of the rear dormer to be similar in appearance to those used in the main roof of the subject dwellinghouse when viewed from ground level, would therefore not be within the tolerances of Schedule 2, Part 1, Class B, B.2 (a) of The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 as amended.",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposal fails to demonstrate that the proposed rooflights would not protrude more than 0.15 metres beyond the plane of the of the slope of the original roof when measured from the perpendicular with the external surface of the original roof, and is therefore not within the tolerances of Schedule 2, Part 1, Class C, C.1(B) of The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 as amended.",
