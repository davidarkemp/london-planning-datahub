    "Reason : 1 - Part of the dwellinghouse would, as a result of the works, extend beyond the plane of an existing roof slope which forms the principal elevation of the dwellinghouse and fronts a highway. The proposal would therefore not be within the tolerances of Schedule 2, Part 1, Class B, B.1(c) of The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development)(England) Order 2015 as amended.",
    "Reason : 2 - The cubic content of the resulting roof space would exceed the cubic content of the original roof space by more than 50 cubic metres. The proposal would therefore not be within the tolerances of Schedule 2, Part 1, Class B, B.1(d)(ii) of The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development)(England) Order 2015 as amended.",
