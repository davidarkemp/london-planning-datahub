    "Reason : 1 - By virtue of the fact that the proposed energy strategy involves development on the former Civic Centre site which falls outside of the red line boundary of the application site as indicated within application P/4477/21, the proposed temporary and permanent heat connection works cannot be permitted as part of this discharge of conditions application and require separate planning permission. Nevertheless, there is also insufficient information provided for this revised energy strategy with a lack of clarity on exactly when a permanent connection to the former Civic Centre site will come into effect, how this will be enforced, insufficient contingency details in the event that the development of the former Civic Centre site is delayed or not developed at all, and finally no detail has been provided with respect to the difference in carbon savings achieved through the revised strategy and that previously agreed. The details submitted pursuant to the discharge of Condition 39 (Energy Strategy) are therefore unsatisfactory, and the Council cannot be satisfied that the proposal would be appropriately sustainable, contrary to the requirements of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023), Policy S2 of the London Plan, and Policies DM12, DM13 and DM14 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013)."
