    "Reason : 1 - The proposed first floor side extension together with the existing hip to gable roof extension, by reason of their excessive combined width, bulk massing would form an incongruous, discordant, contrived, unduly bulky and dominant addition to the host dwelling and street scene. The proposal would thereby be contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023), Policies D3.D(1) and D3.D(11) of The London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 A., DM1 B. (a), (b) and (c) of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed single storey rear extension, by reason of its rearward projection and siting, would be overbearing and visually obtrusive and would be detrimental to the amenities of the neighbouring occupiers at No 26 Edward Road, due to a loss of light and outlook, contrary to Policy DM1 of the Development Management Policies Local Plan document (2013) and the relevant provisions of the adopted Harrow Supplementary Planning Document Residential Design Guide (2010). \r\n"
