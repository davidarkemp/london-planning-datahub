    "Reason : 1 - The proposed terrace balcony to the rear at first floor level is not a characteristic within this locality, and by reason of its siting, it would create an unacceptable level of actual and perceived overlooking and a loss of privacy to the detriment of the residential amenities of the neighbouring occupiers at Nos.4 and 6 Ashcroft contrary to Policy D3 (D(7)) of The London Plan (2021), Core Strategy Policy CS1.B (2012), policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Harrow Supplementary Planning Document Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed ground floor rear extension by reason of their cumulative height would fail to provide subordinate and harmonious addition to the host dwellinghouse which would result in overly dominant, obtrusive and incongruous form of development that serves to erode and subsume the character of the dwellinghouse, contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D3 (D(1) and (11)) of The London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010)."
