    "Reason : 1 - The details submitted in relation to the dormer covering and windows demonstrate a low quality material finish, poor design and unacceptable visual appearance and are therefore not considered to adequately safeguard the appearance of the approved development or locality and would result in an unsatisfactory form of development. Additionally, information regarding the painted render system, timber framed rear structures and outbuilding cladding and roofing materials has not been provided to enable the Local Planning Authority to assess whether the proposed development would provide satisfactory details to discharge all parts of Condition 9 (materials) of the approved development. As such, the proposal is contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023) and policy D3.D1 and D3.D11 of The London Plan (2021), policy CS1 of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012) and policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013)."
