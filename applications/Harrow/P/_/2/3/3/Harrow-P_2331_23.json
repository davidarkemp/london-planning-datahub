    "Reason : 1 - The development, by reason of proximity of the proposed tennis court to neighbouring properties, the introduction of unacceptable engineering works in the form of retaining wall and proliferation of chain-link fencing of varying heights would cause harm to the character and appearance of the wider area, would detract from the setting and quality of the open space, introduce excess visual clutter, and have an adverse impact on neighbouring amenity by way of outlook, real or perceived overlooking and loss of privacy of neighbouring properties and potential for intermittent noise nuisance. Additionally, the proposal has failed to demonstrate that there would be adequate biodiversity net gain as a result of the development. As such, the proposal is contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2023) and Policies D3, G4 and G6(D) of The London Plan (2021), Policies CS1.B, CS1.E and CS1.F of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012) and Policies DM1, DM18, DM20 and DM22 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013)."
