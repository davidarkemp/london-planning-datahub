    "Reason : 1 - The proposed rear dormer due to its excessive size and scale and insufficient set back from the roof eaves, would not relate well or harmonise with the design and appearance of the host dwelling. The proposal would result in an unsympathetic form of development which is bulky and unduly obtrusive to the detriment of the character and appearance of the host dwelling and the Tookes Green Conservation Area contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policies D3 (D(1) and D(11)) and HC1 of The London Plan (2021), policies CS1.B and CS1.D of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), policies DM1 and DM7 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013), the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010) and the Tookes Green Management Strategy (2009). \r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed alterations to the garage and two front rooflights due to their poor design and cluttering would not relate well or harmonise with the appearance of the host dwelling. The proposal would result in an unsympathetic form of development which is unduly obtrusive to the detriment of the character and appearance of the host dwelling and the Tookes Green Conservation Area contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policies D3 (D(1) and D(11)) and HC1 of The London Plan (2021), policies CS1.B and CS1.D of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), policies DM1 and DM7 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013), the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010) and the Tookes Green Management Strategy (2009). ",
    "Reason : 3 -  The proposed single storey rear extension, by reason of its excessive depth, inclusion of glazing facing the boundary and siting would be overbearing and would permit direct/ perceived overlooking of No.74 Marsh Road, resulting in a unneighbourly form of development that would be detrimental to the visual and residential amenities of the occupiers of No. 74 Marsh Road. The proposed development would therefore be contrary to Policy D3 (D(7)) of the London Plan (2021), policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).
