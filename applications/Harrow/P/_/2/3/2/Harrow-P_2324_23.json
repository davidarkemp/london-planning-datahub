    "Reason : 1 - The proposal by reason of its site coverage would result in the new building being sited on garden land. As such, the principle of the development is contrary to the Harrow Core Strategy of directing new residential and other development to the Harrow and Wealdstone Opportunity Area, town centres and, in suburban areas, to strategic previously developed sites and would therefore harm its implementation, contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2023), Policies CS1.A and CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Garden Land Development (2013).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed new building, by reason of its excessive scale, bulk, massing, footprint, site coverage, visual prominence, poor and convoluted design,  its failure to retain sufficient soft landscaping on site for setting, and its incorporation of unsympathetic design features including balconies, ground floor terraces, and expansive street facing patio doors, would form an incongruous, unsympathetic and contrived form of development, which results in an overdevelopment of the site, appears unduly prominent when viewed along the street scene, and would fail to be in keeping with the prevailing pattern of buildings within the area. The proposal would thereby be contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023), Policies D3 D(1) and D3 D(11) of the London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policies DM1 A, DM1 B (a), (b), (c), (d) and (e), DM22 B, and DM23 C of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013), and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed new building, by reason of its excessive height, bulk, scale, massing, and proximate siting in relation to the narrow rear garden of No. 42 Somervell Road, would appear as unduly overbearing, uneighbourly and prominent when viewed from the rear garden of this neighbouring property, unduly restricting the overall level of outlook and visual amenity currently afforded. The proposed development would thereby be contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023), Policy D3 D(7) of The London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policies DM1 C and DM1 D (d) and (e) of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 4 - The new building's proposed balconies and terraces, and the proposed communal amenity area, by reason of their extensive prominence and visibility along the street scene and local highways, would fail to provide prospective users with adequate levels of privacy. Furthermore, by reason of insufficient screening, the use of the proposed communal amenity area would enable harmful overlooking of ground floor habitable room windows and terraces within the building. The proposed development would therefore contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023), Policy D3 D(7) of The London Plan (2021), Policies DM1 C, DM1 D (a) and DM1 D (b) of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010)."
