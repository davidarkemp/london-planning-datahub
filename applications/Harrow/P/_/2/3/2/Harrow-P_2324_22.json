    "Reason : 1 - The two storey side extension, in conjunction with the existing hip to gable extension, by reason of inappropriate design, excessive bulk and massing would result in a contrived and incongruous extension that would unacceptably harm the character of the original dwellinghouse and the visual amenities of the area, contrary to policies D3 (D(1) and D(11)) of The London Plan (2021), Policy CS1.B on the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 of the Development Management Local Plans Policies (2013) and  Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The rear dormer, by reason of its excessive size and its lack of visual containment within the rear roofslope, fails to respect the scale and proportions of the existing property and gives rise to a bulky and dominant addition, to the detriment of the character and appearance of the existing dwellinghouse and the surrounding area, contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policy D3 (D(1) and D(11)) of The London Plan (2021) Core policy CS1.B of The Harrow Core Strategy (2012), policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document Residential Design Guide (2010).\r\n\r\n"
