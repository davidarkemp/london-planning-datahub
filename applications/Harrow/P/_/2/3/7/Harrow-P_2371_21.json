    "Reason : 1 - The proposed electronic rising bollards, by reason of their design, siting and materials, would introduce an incongruous and unsympathetic urban feature that would be out of character with the soft and informal character of the locality and street scene, resulting in harm to the setting of the dwellinghouse and the character and appearance of the Canons Park Conservation Area and there is no clear and convincing justification for this harm, nor public benefits to outweigh it, contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy HC1 of the London Plan (2021), Core Strategy Policies CS1.B and CS1.D of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policies DM1 and DM7 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013), the adopted Supplementary Planning Document Residential Design Guide (2010) and Canons Park Conservation Area Appraisal and Management Strategy (2013)."
