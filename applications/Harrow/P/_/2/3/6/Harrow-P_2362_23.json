    "Reason : 1 - The proposed first floor side extension together with the hip to gable roof extensions, by reason of their excessive combined width, bulk, massing and incompatible roof form, would form an incongruous, discordant, contrived, unduly bulky and dominant addition to the host dwelling and street scene. The proposal would thereby be contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023), Policies D3.D(1) and D3.D(11) of The London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 A., DM1 B. (a), (b) and (c) of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010)."
