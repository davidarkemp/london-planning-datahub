    "Reason : 1 - The proposed operation hours would give rise to additional activity, noise, disturbance, loitering and antisocial behaviour at unsocial hours, which would detract from the residential amenity of the occupiers of surrounding residential properties within close proximity of the site and result in worsened impacts of crime and disorder within the locality, contrary to Policies D3 D (9), D11 C, D13 C, D and E and D14 A of the London Plan (2021) and Policies DM1 D (h), DM2 A (d) and DM38 A (b) of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) in addition to Section 17 of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998.",
    "Reason : 2 - In the absence of details on the number and extent of additional delivery drivers, vehicles and general staff required as a result of the proposed extension in operation hours, the Council cannot be satisfied that the development would have an acceptable impact in regards to local on-street vehicular parking strain. The proposal would thereby be contrary to Policies T4, T6, T6.3 and T7 of the London Plan (2021) and Policies DM42 F, and DM44 C of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013)."
