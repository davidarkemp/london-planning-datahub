    "Reason : 1 - The proposed single storey front infill extension, roof extension to raise ridge height with creation of a crown roof and the associated roof over the two storey rear extension, when considered in combination with the existing extensions are cumulatively considered to give rise to bulky, obtrusive and incongruous additions to the property and would result in a dominant design fronting the streetscene and would fail to respect the pattern of development in the area and would not be proportionate or sympathetic to the existing dwelling. It would therefore be contrary to the high-quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023), Policy D3 (D(1) and D(11)) of The London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1(B) of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).\r\n"
