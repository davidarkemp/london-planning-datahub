    "Reason : 1 - The proposal, by reason of the overall footprint and siting on a private residential garden, would result in an inappropriate form of development at odds with the spatial strategy for the Borough of directing new residential and other development to the Harrow and Wealdstone Opportunity Area, town centres and, in suburban areas, to strategic previously developed sites and would therefore harm its implementation and the contribution that gardens make to the character of the area contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021),  Policies CS1.A and CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document Garden Land Development (2013).\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed new dwellinghouse, by reason of its design bulk, scale comprising a three-storey building and roof form, would be unduly bulky, imposing, and overbearing. resulting in a development which would be incongruous and at odds with the character of the area and the prevailing pattern of development in the streetscene, to the detriment of the character and appearance of the area, contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policy D3 (D(1) and D(11)) of The London Plan (2021), policy CS1.B of The Harrow Core Strategy (2012) and policy DM1 of the Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013).\r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - The large windows and third floor terrace by reason of the siting in relation to neighbouring properties at Nos. 62 and 66 Grange Gardens would give rise to actual and perceived overlooking to the detriment of the residential amenities of these neighbouring occupiers. As such, the proposed is contrary to policy D3 (D(7)) of The London Plan (2021), policy CS1.B of The Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document Residential Design Guide (2010.",
    "Reason : 4 - The proposal by reason of excessive height, depth and overall scale facing No.62 Grange Gardens and overall height and scale facing No.66 Grange Garden, would result in an overbearing development which would give rise to impacts on the visual amenities of the occupiers of Nos. 62 and 66 Grange Gardens.  As such, the proposed is contrary to policy D3 (D(7)) of The London Plan (2021), policy CS1.B of The Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document Residential Design Guide (2010)."
