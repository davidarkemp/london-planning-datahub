    "Reason : 1 - The maximum height as stated on the submitted application form is inconsistent with the submitted drawings as it does not include the proposed roof lantern within the maximum height. The developer has therefore provided insufficient information to comply with condition A.4(2)(a)(ii) of development permitted by Class A.1(g) to Part 1 (of Schedule 2) of The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015, as amended.",
    "Reason : 2 - The application form states that the proposed development would have an eaves height of 2.6 metres, however the eaves height has not been measured correctly to the top of the surface of the roof. The developer has therefore provided insufficient information for the local planning authority to make a determination with respect to limitation A.1(i) and condition A.4(2)(a)(iii) to Class A of Part 1 (of Schedule 2) of The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015, as amended"
