    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development of the site would result in a building being sited on garden land and is therefore at odds with the Councils spatial strategy for growth, which directs new residential and other development to the Harrow and Wealdstone Opportunity Area, town centres and, in suburban areas, to strategic previously developed sites, and would therefore harm its implementation contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), policy 3.5.A of The London Plan 2016, policies CS1.A and CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy 2012 and adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Garden Land Development (2013).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed building, by reason of its siting, height, poor design, proximity to site boundaries and lack of adequate setting space would result in a cramped, dominant, incongruous and obtrusive form of development that would fail to respect the prevailing pattern of development in the area, to the detriment of the character and appearance of the streetscene and the local area, contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), and contrary to policies 7.4 B and 7.6 B of The London Plan (2016), Policy D4 of the Draft London Plan Intend to Publish (2019), Core Strategy Policy CS1.B (2012), policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Residential Design Guide SPD (2010).",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed building, by reason of its siting and proximity to the boundaries, and by reason of the of the inadequate gross internal floor space, double bedroom size and provision of built-in storage for the Ground Floor Flat and inadequate provision of private amenity space for the occupiers of the First Floor Flat, would result in a substandard quality of living accommodation to the detriment of the residential amenities of future occupiers of the residential unit, contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2019),  policies 3.5.B, 3.5.C, 3.8 and 7.6B of The London Plan (2016), Policies D1 and D3 of the Draft London Plan Intend to Publish (2019), policies DM1, DM26 and DM27 of the Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013), the Mayor of London Housing Supplementary Planning Guidance (2016) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 4 - The proposed building, by reason of its siting, height and proximity to the side and rear boundaries, would result in a loss of privacy for occupiers at no.59 Graham Road, by way of overlooking and perceived overlooking from proposed ground and first floor side windows, and would result in an obtrusive, overbearing impact, by way of loss of outlook and light, visual intrusion and overshadowing, when viewed from the rear windows and rear garden of no.59 Graham Road and the rear garden no.57 Graham Road, thereby leading to a loss of residential amenity for the neighbouring occupiers contrary to Policy 7.6B of The London Plan (2016), Policy DM1 of the Development Management Plan Local Policies (2013) and the Adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 5 - Insufficient information has been submitted to the Local Planning Authority to demonstrate that the proposal would provide adequate on site cycle storage, refuse storage, amenity space and landscaping. The proposal therefore fails to accord with the London Plan (2016) and policy DM1, DM42 and DM 26 of the Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013)."
