    "Reason : 1 - The proposal, by reason of its scale, bulk, and design, would constitute an unsympathetic and incongruous form of development in a visually prominent location that would fail to integrate successfully with the host property. Furthermore, the proposed extension would relate poorly to, and cause harm to, the local spatial character of the location. The development therefore fails to comply with the National Planning Policy Framework (2019),  policies 7.4B and 7.6B of the London Plan (2016), policy D3 of the Draft London Plan - Intend to Publish (2019), Core Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), policy DM1 of the Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposal would constitute an unneighbourly form of development that would harm the amenity of neighbouring properties in the form of poor vertical stacking arrangements, increased overlooking, loss of outlook, being overbearing and creating an increased sense of enclosure. The proposals have also failed to demonstrate that there would not be unacceptable harm to neighbouring windows in respect to reductions in daylight and sunlight. As such, the proposal would introduce an unneighbourly form of development which would be detrimental to the amenities of the adjoining occupiers, contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), policy 7.6B the London Plan (2016), policy 4.2A.6 of the Draft London Plan - Intend to Publish (2019), policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010)."
