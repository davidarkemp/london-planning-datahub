    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development, by reason of poor detailed design, with large irregular rear facing window and excessive scale above the existing main roof and rear outrigger, together with the proposed pitched roof over the existing two storey rear extension, would give rise to  cumulatively disproportionate additions which would appear unduly bulky, out of scale, incongruous and dominant. It would therefore fail to respect the proportions, character, window hierarchy and general design of the original building and would be at odds with the established pattern of development in the wider area, having a detrimental impact on the visual amenities when seen in long views of the streetscene.  The proposed development would therefore be contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies D3.D(1) and D3.D(11) of The London Plan (2021), Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 of the Development Management Plan Local Policies (2013) and the Adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed development, by reason of the pitched roof above the existing two-storey rear extension (at the rear of the existing outrigger) would result in harm to the outlook and sense of enclosure of the rear facing window in No.29 Love Lane, to the detriment of the residential amenities of that property. The development is therefore contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D3.D(7) of The London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1 (B) of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), policy DM 1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010)."
