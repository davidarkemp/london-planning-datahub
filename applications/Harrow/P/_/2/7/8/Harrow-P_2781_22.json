    "Reason : 1 - Within the context of the planning permission P/3484/21 allowed at appeal on 01/04/2022 (APP/M5450/D/21/3285848), the alterations in the massing of the dormer and infilling of the dwellinghouseï¿½s arched side entrance way would result in the scheme being different in its massing, scale and overall footprint, furthermore the application of a render finish to the main dwellinghouse at ground floor level and installation of a new side entrance canopy and new side entrance door would form new elements of development that were not included as part of the development proposed under application P/3484/21. The proposed alterations would thereby result in in a material change to the character and appearance of the host dwelling, street scene and wider area, and would also result in a material change in impact on the residential amenities of adjacent neighbours. It would therefore require re-consultation of neighbouring properties, and the proposal would need to be re-assessed against the requirements of Policy D3 of The London Plan (2021) and Policy DM1 of the Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010). The proposal is therefore not considered to form a non-material minor amendment."
