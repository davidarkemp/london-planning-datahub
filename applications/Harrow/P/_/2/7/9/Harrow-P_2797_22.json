    "Reason : 1 - The site has an extant prior approval granted under ref: P/0466/21/PRIOR for conversion of the existing offices located on the first and second floors to residential. Therefore, the proposal fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph Class AA.1(za) of Class AA, Part 20, of Schedule 2 of The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 as amended, which states that development is not permitted under Class AA if the permission to use the buildings as a dwellinghouse has been granted only by virtue of Class MA of Part 3 of Schedule 2. \r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - Notwithstanding the submitted drawings, the proposed additional two storeys, by reason of its design and appearance failing to sympathetically relate to, and assimilate with the existing appearance of the host building, would result in a contrived and incongruous form of development which would adversely impact upon the overall design, character and appearance of the existing building in the streetscene. The development would, therefore, not represent an appropriate high quality of design, as required by National Planning Policy Framework (2021) (Paragraphs 126,127 and 134), Policy D3 (D(1) and D(11)) of The London Plan (2021), Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies (2013) and would not be within the tolerances of Condition AA.2(1)(e) Class AA, Part 20 of Schedule 2 of the General Permitted Development Order (2015) as amended.\r\n"
