    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development, by reason of its location within a designated Industrial and Business Use Area in active use, and the resulting loss of industrial land from the boroughs stocks for which there is an identified need and the failure to satisfactorily demonstrate, evidence and justify the release of Industrial and Business Use Land for a residential development, would fail to accord with the spatial objectives of the Harrow Development Plan. The Proposal would therefore be contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), Policy 4.4 of The London Plan (2016), Policy E4 of the draft London Plan (2019), Policy CS1O of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM31 of the Harrow Development Management Policies (2013) and Policy AAP15 of the Harrow and Wealdstone Area Action Plan (2013)",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed development, by reason of its layout, siting, scale, massing, and appearance would give rise to a cramped, crude, obtrusive, contrived and abhorrent addition that would be visually intrusive, grossly dominant and discordant and would amount to overdevelopment of the site and fail to represent a high quality of design, harmfully detracting from the  the regularity of the surrounding pattern of development and the character and appearance of the locality, contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), policies 7.1D, 7.4B and 7.6B of The London Plan (2016), Core Policy CS1B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013), Policies AAP3 and AAP4 of the Harrow and Wealdstone Area Action Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document Residential Design Guide (2010)",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed development, by reason of its use, siting, layout, massing, height, form, appearance and window openings in the flank elevations would have a materially harmful impact on the residential and privacy amenities of the adjoining occupiers, contrary to Policy 7.6D of the London Plan (2016), Policies DM1 and DM30 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013), Policy AAP4 of the Harrow and Wealdstone Area Action Plan (2013)  and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 4 - The proposed development, by reason of configuration of the bedrooms with the pitched roof profile, the lack of amenity space and the contrived window openings, would result in a substandard layout and poor light and outlook from the proposed bedrooms and would fail to provide an acceptable quantum of amenity space. The proposal would thereby fail to provide residential accommodation of a high standard of design and quality to the detriment of the future occupiers of the development, contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), Policies 3.5C, 3.8B, and 7.6B of The London Plan (2016), Policies DM1, DM28 and DM30 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and Policies AAP4 and AAP13 of the Harrow and Wealdstone Area Action Plan (2013)",
    "Reason : 5 - The proposal, by reason of its siting within Environment Agency (EA) Flood Zones 2 and 3 and Surface Water Flood Zones 3a and 3b and the failure to provide a Sequential Test and an acceptable Flood Risk Assessment with appropriate flood resistant and resilience measures, would result in a development that is not directed to a site of lower flood risk in line with the Development Plan for the borough and would fail to demonstrate that the proposed development would not exacerbate the risk of flooding within the site or increase the risk and consequences of flooding elsewhere, contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), Policy 5.12 of The London Plan (2016), Core Policy CS1U/V of Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM9 of the Harrow Development Management Polices Local Plan (2013) and Policy AAP9 of the Harrow and Wealdstone Area Action Plan (2013).",
    "Reason : 6 - The proposal has failed to demonstrate that the development would not adversely affect the infrastructure of a main river, contrary to Policy DM11 of the Harrow Development Management Policies (2013)",
    "Reason : 7 - The proposal, by reason of the unacceptable provision of cycle storage within the bedrooms,  would fail to provide secure, integrated, convenient and accessible cycle parking facilities, contrary to Policy 6.9 of the London Plan (2016)."
