    "Reason : 1 - The proposal, by reason of the excessive width and depth of the first floor side to rear extension, and by reason of the raised roof ridge and the accumulation of various poorly designed flat roof forms, would dominate the character of the existing and adjoining dwelling, and would result in a poor form of development which would harm the prevailing character of the immediate street scene, contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021, Policy D3 (D(1) and D(11)) of the London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013), and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposal, by reason of the depth and siting of the ground and first floor rear extensions along the side shared boundary with No 1 Bromefield, and subsequent loss of outlook, would result in an overbearing form of development for neighbours on this side of the boundary, to the detriment of their living conditions, and contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies D3.D (7) and D3.D (10), and D6.B of the London Plan (2021), Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Polices Local Plan (2013) and the Residential Design Guide Supplementary Planning Document (2010)."
