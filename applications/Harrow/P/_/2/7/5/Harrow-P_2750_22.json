    "Reason : 1 - The proposed ground floor front porch and ground floor side extension, by reason of its depth, width, and its siting along the side shared boundary with Brick Lane, would dominate the proportions of the subject and adjoining dwellings and would result in a bulky and incongruous addition to the street scene, contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D3 (D(1) and D(11)) of the London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1 (B) of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), policy DM 1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed two storey side to rear extension, by reason of its excessive width and depth along the side shared boundary with Brick Lane, combined with the accumulation of various poorly designed flat roof forms, along with the excessive width and massing of the proposed dormer window,  would represent a massing and bulk which would dominate the character of the existing and adjoining dwellings, and would result in a poor form of development which would harm the prevailing character and appearance of the immediate street scene, contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021, Policy D3 (D(1) and D(11)) of the London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013), and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposal, by reason of the depth and siting of the ground and first floor rear extensions along the side shared boundary with No 3 Bromefield, and subsequent loss of outlook, would result in an overbearing form of development for neighbours on this side of the boundary, to the detriment of their living conditions, and contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies D3.D (7 and 10) of the London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 of the Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013), and the Adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 4 - The proposal, by reason of the site being located within Flood Zones, and an area of land liable to flooding, and the lack of Flood Risk Assessment, including appropriate flood resistant and resilience measures, the applicant has failed to demonstrate that the proposed development would not exacerbate the risk of flooding within the site or increase the risk and consequences of flooding elsewhere, contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies SI12 and SI3 of The London Plan (2021), Policy CS1.U Of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), and contrary to Policies DM9 and DM10 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Plan (2013)."
