    "Reason : 1 - The proposal would result in the additional dwellinghouse being sited on garden land. As such, the principle of the development is contrary to the Harrow Core Strategy of directing new residential and other development to the Harrow and Wealdstone Opportunity Area, town centres and, in suburban areas, to strategic previously developed sites and would therefore harm its implementation, contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies D1.A (3), D3.D (1), and D3.D (11) of the London Plan (2021), Policies CS1.A and CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012) and the Adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Garden Land Development (2013).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed dwellinghouse, by reason of its incongruous shape, form and siting where it would be cramped in its plot, and by reason of the siting of space for refuse and cycle storage, would interrupt the pattern and grain of development within the existing streetscene and would result in unnecessary street clutter. The development therefore fails to meet the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies D3.D (1) and D3.D (11) of the London Plan (2021), Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Polices Local Plan (2013) and the Residential Design Guide Supplementary Planning Document (2010).",
    "Reason : 3 - The development, by reason of the cramped and in-practical layout of the front garden area, and insufficient information on how the proposal would accommodate cycle parking, refuse storage, and car parking for both the existing and proposed dwellings, would result in a form of development which would fail to have regard to a functional and practical layout, to the detriment of existing and future occupiers, and contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies D3.D (7 and 10) and Policy D6.E of the London Plan (2021), Policies DM1 and DM45 of the Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013), and the Adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 4 - The proposed dwelling, by reason of its height and siting and proximity to the rear wall of No 21 Dobbin Close, would result in an unacceptable loss of daylight and sunlight to ground floor rear windows at No 21 Dobbin Close, to the detriment of their residential amenity and contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D6.B of the London Plan (2021), Policy DM1 of the Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013), and the Adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 5 - By reason of the site being located within Flood Zones, and an area of land liable to flooding, and the lack of Flood Risk Assessment, including appropriate flood resistant and resilience measures, the applicant has failed to demonstrate that the proposed development would not exacerbate the risk of flooding within the site or increase the risk and consequences of flooding elsewhere, contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies SI12 and SI3 of The London Plan (2021), Policy CS1.U Of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), and to Policies DM9 and DM10 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Plan (2013)."
