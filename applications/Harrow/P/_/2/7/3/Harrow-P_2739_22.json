    "Reason : 1 - The proposed front extension, by reason of its inappropriate and poor-quality design, would result in an unsympathetic and jarring addition to the existing dwellinghouse; while conflicting plans of the design of the two-storey frontage of the proposed extension have been submitted. The proposal would thereby result in harm to the character and appearance of the site and the local streetscene, contrary to policy DM3 (D(1) and D(11)) of The London Plan (2021), policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013), and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document Residential Design Guide (2010). \r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - Insufficient information has been provided to demonstrate that the proposed new dwelling would comply with the minimum internal heights for new dwellinghouses. The proposal has therefore not demonstrated compliance with policy D6 of the London Plan (2021), policy CS1.K of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), and policies DM1 and DM26 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013). \r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed development, by reason of its siting in local surface water flood zones 3a, in the absence of an adequate Flood Risk Assessment to assess the future impacts and provide adequate mitigation measures, and in the absence of information demonstrating the proposal would not damage the adjacent piped watercourse, would be likely to result in the displacement of water onto adjacent land and fail to provide resilience to flooding, and would be likely to result in harm to the adjacent watercourse, to the detriment of the safety of future occupiers of the application site and adjacent sites, contrary to policies SI 12 and SI 13 of The London Plan (2021),  policy CS1.U of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), and policies DM9, DM10 and DM11.D of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013).\r\n"
