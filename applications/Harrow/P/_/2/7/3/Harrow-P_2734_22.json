    "Reason : 1 - The proposed variation of condition 2 in respect of amendments to allow mechanical plant, associated enclosure and rear dormer style window fall outside the scope of the approved description of development under planning permission P/0665/21 Dated 03/09/2021.  Therefore the proposal cannot be considered as a material minor amendment to the original planning permission and as such proposed amendments are therefore contrary to Section 73 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990.\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - Notwithstanding reason 1 above, in the absence of any information demonstrating that potential noise impacts from the mechanical plant on neighbouring occupiers would be within acceptable levels, and/or that sufficient mitigation measures would be implemented, it is considered that insufficient information has been submitted for the Local Planning Authority to make a determination with respect to noise impacts on neighbouring occupiers. The proposal is therefore contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policy D14 of The London Plan (2021), and Policy DM1 of Harrow's Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013). \r\n"
