    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development, by reason of its poor architectural design, particularly the height of the proposed building; would fail to respect the external appearance and design of the existing dwelling, would result in a harmful unbalancing effect between No. 33 and 31 Northwick Park Road and would fail to respect the prevailing character in the streetscene. The development would therefore fail to meet the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D3 (D(1) and D(11)) of The London Plan (2021), policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document Residential Design Guide (2010). The proposal would therefore not be within the tolerances of Condition AA.2(3)(a)(ii) of Class AA of Part 1, Schedule 2 of The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - In the absence of section drawings detailing the internal head height of the existing dwelling and new additional storey, the Council cannot be satisfied that the floor to ceiling height of the new storey would not exceed the lower of 3 metres, or the floor to ceiling height of any storey of the principle part of the existing dwellinghouse. The proposed development would thereby be contrary to requirement AA.1 (h) of Part 1 of Schedule 2 of The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).\r\n"
