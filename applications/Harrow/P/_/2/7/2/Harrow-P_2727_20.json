    "Reason : 1 - The proposed enlargements of the side dormers, together with the extension of the eastern dormer over the existing two storey side extension, by reason of their scale, bulk, unsympathetic roof design and prominent siting would be an overbearing incongruous addition that represents poor quality design resulting in disproportionate additions to the original building which would be out of character with the established pattern of development in the locality. The proposals would be harmful to the character and appearance of the original property and the visual amenities of the area, contrary to policies 7.4 and 7.6 of The London Plan (2016), policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012) and policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013).\r\n"
