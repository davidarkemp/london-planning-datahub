    "Reason : 1 - Insufficient information has been provided to demonstrate that the applicant is the identified owner of the land or that in the absence of an identified owner of the land to which the development related, that the appropriate notice has been given by or on behalf of the developer through a local advertisement prior to the submission of the subject application. The proposal would therefore fail to comply with the conditions and limitations of Schedule 2, Part 16, Class A.3(1) and A.3(2) of the The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 as amended.",
    "Reason : 2 - Notwithstanding the above, the proposed telecommunications pole, by reason of its excessive height, prominent location within the streetscene and proximity to residential properties would be incongruent and visually intrusive, to the detriment of the character and appearance of the area and the visual amenities of neighbouring residential occupiers, contrary to policies DM1 and DM49 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013)."
