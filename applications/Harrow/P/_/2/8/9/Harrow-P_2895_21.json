    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development by reason of its size, scale, siting, bulk and poor design would appear unduly bulky, obtrusive and incongruous and close the gap at first floor level it would also give rise to a disproportionate addition which would subsume the host dwelling failing to preserve the character and appearance of the conservation area and the special interest of the locally listed building. The proposal would be contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policies D3.D(1), D3D(11), HC1 of The London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1 of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policies DM1 and DM7 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document - Residential Design Guide (2010) and Roxeth Hill Conservation Area Appraisal and Management Strategy (2007)."
