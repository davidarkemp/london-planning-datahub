    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development, by reason of the excessive number of occupiers that it accommodates together with the flank elevation windows serving bedrooms 2 and 6, represent an overly intensive use of the site which would be likely to give rise to undue levels of disturbance to adjoining occupiers and result in the loss of privacy to No. 217 The Ridgeway. Furthermore, in the absence of satisfactory outlook to bedrooms 2 and 6, loss of privacy to bedroom 2 and unsatisfactory internal room heights for some parts of bedroom 9, the proposed development would result in a cramped and poor standard of living accommodation, to the detriment of the living conditions of the future occupiers of this development. The development is therefore contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), policies 3.5 and 7.6B of The London Plan (2016), policy D6 of The 'Intended to publish' Draft London Plan (2019), policies DM1 and DM30 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the Council's adopted Supplementary Planning Document Residential Design Guide (2010).\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposal, by reason of it siting in an area of poor accessibility would give rise to an unsustainable development which would fail to contribute towards the effectiveness of sustainable transport, and which would be likely to result in significant increases in on-street parking, contrary to National Planning Policy Framework (2019), Policies, 6.3, 6.9 and 6.13 of The London Plan (2016), Policies T5 and T6.1 of the 'Intended to publish' Draft London Plan (2019) - Intend to Publish Version and Policies DM42 and DM30 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013).\r\n"
