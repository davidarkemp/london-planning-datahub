    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development, by reason of the substantial loss of retail floorspace of the ground floor commercial unit, would undermine the core retail and other principal functions of the non-designated shopping frontage within the Harrow Weald town centre and would not form an appropriate use of the ground floor premises. As such, the proposal would be contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policy E9 of The London Plan (2021) and policy DM38 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013).",
    "Reason : 2 - The development, by reason of the internal layout of the ground floor flat   providing single aspect unit, fronting on to the service yard and being accessed from the service road, in conjunction with the inadequate stacking between the bedroom and living room of the upper floor flats and failing to meet the minimum floor to ceiling height of 2.3m for at least 75% of the Gross Internal Area for the second floor flat, would result in a cramped and poor standard of living accommodation for future occupiers to the detriment of their residential amenities,  contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies D3.D.7 and D6 of The London Plan (2021), Policies DM 1 and DM 26 of the Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013), the National Housing Standards-Nationally Described Space Standards (2015), The  Mayor of London Housing Supplementary Planning Guidance (2016), and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed rear dormer extension to the main roof and two storey rear outrigger, by reason of its overall poor design, scale and bulk would form an insubordinate and dominant addition to the host  as a result the proposed development would be detrimental to the character and appearance of the existing dwellinghouse and the established and prevailing pattern of development in the locality contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D3 (D(1) and (11)) of The  London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 4 - The proposal, by reason of a rear entrance to the proposed flat 2, would result in an unsafe and unsatisfactory living environment, leading to a risk or a fear of crime, contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D11 of The  London Plan (2021), Policies DM1 and DM2 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010)."
