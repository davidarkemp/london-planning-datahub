    "Reason : 1 - The proposed rear pergola attached to the single storey rear extension and the proposed rear outbuilding and its associated pergola, by reason of their excessive combined bulk, massing, footprint, and site coverage together with other additions to the rear of the property including the single storey rear extension, and outbuilding to the rear of the garden, result in an unsympathetic and contrived form of development that constitutes an overdevelopment of the application site, unduly detracting from its original form and the established pattern of development within the surrounding area. The proposed development would thereby be contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies D3.D(1) and D3.D(11) of The London Plan (2021), Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 A, DM1 B (a), (b), (c) and (d) of the Development Management Plan Local Policies (2013) and the Adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed pergola attached to the single storey rear extension by reason of its height, siting and excessive rearward projection beyond No.15 Hillside Crescent, gives rise to an unduly dominant and overbearing form of development, which results in an unacceptable loss of outlook to the rear garden and ground floor rear facing habitable room windows of No.15 Hillside Crescent. The proposed development would thereby be contrary to policy D3.D(7) of The London Plan (2021), policy DM1 C, DM1 D (e) and (f) of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010)."
