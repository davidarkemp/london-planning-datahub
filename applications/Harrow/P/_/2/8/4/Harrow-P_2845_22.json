    "Reason : 1 - The proposed two storey rear extension and single storey rear extension by reason of its excessive width, depth and bulk would result in an overly dominant form of development, that would fail to respect the proportions of the existing dwellinghouse and the character and appearance of the neighbouring properties, to the detriment of the character and appearance of the existing dwellinghouse and the surrounding area, contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policy D1.D(1) and (11) of The London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1 B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document Residential Design Guide (2010).\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - 2. The proposed single storey rear extension by reason of its overall design, depth and scale would result in a dominant and obtrusive form of development, that would have a harmful impact on the adjoining neighbouring property at no. 127 in terms of loss of light, outlook and an increased sense of enclosure. As such the proposal would be contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D3 of The London Plan (2021), Policy DM1 of the Development Management Policies Local Plan document (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010)."
