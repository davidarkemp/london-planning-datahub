    "Reason : 1 - The proposed single storey side extension and side dormer extension by reason of their prominent siting, excessive size and scale would give rise to a bulky, disproportionate addition which would be unduly obtrusive to the character and appearance of the original dwellinghouse and the visual amenities of the area, contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), policy D3 of the London Plan (2021), policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 2 - Insufficient information has been provided to fully assess the impact of the proposed development on the adjacent trees, which are subject to a Tree Preservation Order. In the absence of this information, it has not been demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority that the proposed development would not result in a detrimental impact to the health and longevity of the adjacent trees. The proposed development is therefore contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), policy G7 of the London Plan (2021) and policies DM1 and DM22 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013)."
