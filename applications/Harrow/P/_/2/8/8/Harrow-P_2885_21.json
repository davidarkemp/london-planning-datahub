    "Reason : 1 - The proposed first floor side extension, by reason of its overall scale, siting and its close proximity to the shared boundary would fail to positively respond to the original architecture of the host building, adversely affecting its overall detached appearance and contribution to the wider street scene and would detract from the established pattern of development within the immediate area. As such, the proposal is therefore considered contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), D3.D (1) and (11) of the London Plan (2021), policy CS1.B of The Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document Residential Design Guide (2010)."
