  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed part single and part two storey rear extensions, by reason of their excessive depth and by reason of the height and roof form of the proposed two storey rear extension, would result in a scale, bulk and massing which would dominate and subsume the proportions of the subject dwelling, and would fail to preserve or enhance the character or appearance of Canons Park Conservation Area. There is not clear and convincing justification for the harm, nor public benefits to outweigh this harm. The proposed development is therefore contrary to the requirements of paragraphs 197, 199, 200 and 202 of National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies D3.D (1), D3.D (11) and HC1 of The London Plan (2021), Policies CS1.B and CS1.D of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policies DM1 and DM7 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013), the Adopted Supplementary Planning Document Residential Design Guide (2010) and the Canons Park Conservation Area Appraisal and Management Strategy (2013).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposal, due to the none submission of an Arboricultural Report, there is insufficient information available to allow the Council to comprehensively assess the impact of the proposals on existing trees, the landscape character of the Canons Park Conservation Area, and on the Grade II Registered Park and Garden and protected TPO NO.45 trees to the front of the property. The application has not therefore demonstrated that it would not risk compromising the amenity value or survival of these trees. The proposal is therefore contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies HC1 and G7 of the London Plan (2021), and Policies DM7, DM22, and DM23 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013).\r\n"
