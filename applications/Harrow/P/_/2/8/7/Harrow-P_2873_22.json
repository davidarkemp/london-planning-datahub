    "Reason : 1 - The proposed raised roof height, alterations to the crown roof and front and side dormers by reason of their combined bulk, massing, and unsatisfactory design result in an unsympathetic, incongruous, bulky and contrived form of development that fails to respect the character, composition and design of the host dwelling and prevailing pattern of development in within the area. The proposal would thereby be contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D3 (D(1) and (11)) of The  London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 A, DM1 B (a), (b) and (c) of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).\r\n"
