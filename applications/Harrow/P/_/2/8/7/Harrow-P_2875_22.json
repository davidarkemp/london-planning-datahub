  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed redevelopment of the site, by reason of the excessive footprint of the building and its encroachment on a private rear garden area, would represent overdevelopment of the site, and would result in an over-intensive and an inappropriate form of development, at odds with the Councils spatial strategy for growth, which directs new residential and other development to the Harrow and Wealdstone Opportunity Area, town centres and, in suburban areas, to strategic previously developed sites, and would therefore harm its implementation contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policies CS1.A and CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy 2012 and adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Garden Land Development (2013).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposal, by reason of its prominent siting, excessive width, height, overall scale and bulk, inappropriate design and external materials, proximity to site boundaries and lack of adequate setting space would result in a cramped, dominant, incongruous and obtrusive form of development which would fail to respect the character and appearance of the site, the nearby buildings and the prevailing pattern of development in the area, to the detriment of the character and appearance of the streetscene and the local area, contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies D3.D (1)  and D3.D (11) of the London Plan (2021); Core Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed building, by reason of its excessive size, bulk and scale, close proximity to site boundaries and provision of rearward windows would result in overshadowing of and a loss of outlook and loss of privacy to properties situated at Nos 65-73 Camrose Avenue, to the detriment of the amenity of these neighbouring occupiers, contrary to Policy D3.D (7) of The London Plan (2021), Policy DM1 of the Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document - Residential Design Guide (2010)",
    "Reason : 4 - The proposal, by reason of the large scale windows and close proximity to the streetscene and inadequate provision of private amenity space for the occupiers of the dwelling, would result in a substandard quality of living accommodation to the detriment of the residential amenities of the potential future occupiers, contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies D3 and D6 of the London Plan (2021), Policies DM1 and DM27 of the Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013), the Mayor of London Housing Supplementary Planning Guidance (2016) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 5 - The applicant has failed to demonstrate the proposed development would not result in unacceptable impacts on the trees within the site and the street tree adjacent to the site boundary. The proposal is therefore contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy G6 of the London Plan (2021), and Policies DM20, and DM22 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013)."
