    "Condition : 1 - i.  Wrapping of ground floor columns\r\nii.  Amend extent of green material on ground floor facade\r\niii. Addition of a balustrade behind the opening to the 8th floor plant room\r\n",
    "Reason : 1 - Within the context of planning application P/1656/20 granted on 27/04/2021, the proposed alterations to the columns within the ground floor car parking/servicing area could result in a material change to the access to and accessibility of the ground floor accessible car parking and servicing area. It would therefore require re-consultation of the Local Highways Authority and the proposal would need to be re-assessed to ensure suitable accessible car parking, access to service areas including waste servicing, and cycle parking which would be provided within the curtilage of the site, in accordance with the requirements of policies T5 and T6 of The London Plan (2021) and policies DM1, DM42, DM44 and DM45 of the Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013). The proposal is therefore not considered to be non-material minor amendment.\r\n"
