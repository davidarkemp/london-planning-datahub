    "Reason : 1 - The proposed single storey side to rear extension by reason of its siting in relation to neighbouring properties and the ground floor, habitable room rear window of the host building, would result in an un-neighbourly development which would be out of character with the prevailing pattern of development in the area, and lead to overshadowing, unacceptable loss of outlook and sunlight, to the detriment of the residential and visual amenities of the existing and future occupiers, contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D3. D(7) and D(11) of The London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy 2012, Policy DM1 of the Development Management Policies Local Plan document (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).\r\n"
