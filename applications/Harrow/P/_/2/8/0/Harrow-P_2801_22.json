    "Reason : 1 - Within the context of the planning permission P/0379/18 dated 09/10/2018, the proposed development would alter the description of development, which is considered to be material. The amendment would require an assessment as to whether a lower level of parking provision would be acceptable and compliant with Policy, and consultation with the Highways Authority and the adjoining occupiers. \r\nIn addition, the proposal would need to be re-assessed against the requirements of Policy T6 of The London Plan (2021), Policy CS.1 R of the Core Strategy (2012) and Policy DM42 of the Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013). \r\nThe proposal is therefore not considered to be non-material amendment."
