    "Reason : 1 -   From the plans submitted, the proposed maximum height of the extension shown on the submitted drawings differs to what has been stated on the application form, as such, the local planning authority is therefore unable to make a comprehensive and objective assessment of the proposed development.  The proposed development is therefore contrary to A.4(2)(a) and 3(b) to Class A of Part 1 (of Schedule 2) of The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015, as amended.\r\n"
