    "Reason : 1 - The developer has failed to provide a plan indicating the site and showing the proposed development. Therefore, the developer has provided insufficient information to enable the Local Planning Authority to determine whether the proposed development complies with the conditions, limitations and restrictions applicable to development permitted by Class A which exceeds the limits in paragraph A.1(f) but is allowed by paragraph A.1(g). As such, the proposal does not comply with limitations A.4(2)(b) and A.4(3)(b) to Class A of Part 1 (of Schedule 2) of The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015, as amended.",
