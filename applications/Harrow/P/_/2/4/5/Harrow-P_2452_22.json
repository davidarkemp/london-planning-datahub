    "Reason : 1 - The proposed single storey rear extension would be within 2 metres of the boundary of the curtilage of the dwellinghouse, and the height of the eaves of the enlarged part would exceed 3 metres  and is therefore not within the tolerances of Schedule 2, Part 1 Class A.1 (i) of The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 as amended.",
    "Reason : 2 - The enlarged part of the dwellinghouse comprising the single storey rear extension with an attached canopy, would extend beyond a wall forming a side elevation of the original dwellinghouse, and would have a width greater than half the width of the original dwellinghouse and is therefore not within the tolerances of Schedule 2, Part 1 Class A.1 (j (iii)) of The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 as amended.",
