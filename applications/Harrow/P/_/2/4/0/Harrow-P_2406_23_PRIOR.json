    "Reason : 1 - The proposal, by reason of its rearward projection and siting, would be detrimental to the amenities of the neighbouring occupiers at No. 39 and 35 Sussex Road, contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2023), Policy DM1 of the Development Management Policies Local Plan document (2013) and the relevant provisions of the adopted Harrow Supplementary Planning Document Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed single storey rear extension by virtue of its attachment to an original two storey side rear projection, would extend beyond a wall forming a side elevation of the original dwellinghouse and would have a width greater than half of the width of the original dwellinghouse. As such, the proposal would not comply with limitation A.1(J)(iii)) to Class A of Part 1 (of Schedule 2) of The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended)."
