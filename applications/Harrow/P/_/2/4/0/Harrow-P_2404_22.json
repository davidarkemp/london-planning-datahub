    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development's associated bin and cycle storage, by reason of their prominent siting to the front forecourt of the site, the excessive quantity of bins together  with the bulk and massing of the proposed cycle store would result in a harmful visual cluttering of the street scene and would unduly detract from the overall visual amenity afforded along the road. The proposal would thereby be contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies D3.D(1) and D3.D(11) of The London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 A., DM1 B (a) and (c) of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 2 - The kitchen and living/dining areas of the proposed new unit would be provided with unsatisfactory levels of light and outlook, and in the absence of proposed section drawings detailing the internal head height of the unit, the Council cannot be satisfied that the unit would be provided with sufficient internal head heights. The proposed development would therefore give rise to substandard and poor quality accommodation to the detriment of the residential amenities of the future occupiers of the unit contrary to policies D3 D (7), D6 D, D6 F (8) of The London Plan (2021), policies DM1 C, DM1 D (f) and (g) of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013), the Mayor of London Housing Supplementary Planning Guidance (2016), Department for Communities and Local Government Technical Housing Standards - Nationally Described Space Standards (2015), and the adopted Supplementary Planning Documents Residential Design Guide (2010)."
