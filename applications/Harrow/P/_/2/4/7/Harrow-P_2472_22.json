    "Reason : 1 - It has not been demonstrated that the removal of condition 10 (Secure by Design) of planning application P/0249/21, requiring evidence to be submitted to certify Secured by Design Certification, would be appropriate and no justification has been provided to demonstrate that the requirements of the accreditation cannot be met. The removal of the Secure by Design condition would fail to ensure that the risk and fear of crime in respect of the development is minimised contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D11 B of the  London Plan 2021, policy CS 1 E of the Harrow Core Strategy, and policy DM2 A(d) of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013).
