    "Reason : 1 - Insufficient soft landscaping is proposed to the front forecourt to safeguard and improve the appearance and character of the area and to enhance the appearance of the development and to provide defensible planting to secure the privacy of the ground floor windows on the front elevation serving habitable rooms. Furthermore, the proposed soft and hard landscaping plan does not accommodate sufficient bin storage as per the approved proposed ground floor plan (P/0204/21).The proposal is therefore contrary to policy D3.D(14) of The London Plan (2021), policy CS1.B of the Core Strategy (2012), policies DM1.B(d) and (f), DM22.B, DM23.A and DM45.A of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan 2013.",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed siting of the cycle store within the front forecourt would dominate the forecourt area making it appear cluttered and further reducing the opportunity for soft landscaping, resulting in a detrimental impact to the character and appearance of the host building and the surrounding area. The proposal is therefore contrary to policy D3.D (11) and (14) of The London Plan (2021), policy CS1.B of the Core Strategy (2012), policies DM1.B(d) and (f) of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan 2013.\r\n"
