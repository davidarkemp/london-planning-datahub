    "Reason : 1 - The proposed two storey side extension, by reason of its incorporation of an access door to the front elevation at ground floor level and its consistency in appearance with the main front entrance door, results in the building uncharacteristically appearing to have two front entrance doors, appearing contrived, incongruous, unsympathetic and unduly at odds with the established pattern of buildings along the street scene. Furthermore, the development�s proposed bin and cycle store, by reason of its combined width, height, depth, bulk, massing and most notably its prominent siting to the front forecourt and insufficient screening, would appear incongruous and excessively prominent when viewed along the street scene, at odds with established means of bin and cycle storage along the road. The provision of cycle parking to the front forecourt would also be contrary to principles of Secure by Design. The proposal would thereby be contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies D3.D(1), D3.D(11) and D11 of The London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 A, DM1 B (a), (b), (c) and (f), DM2 A (d), DM26 A (g), DM26 C, and DM26 E of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010). ",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed ground floor flat, by reason of its poor layout, internal configuration and circulation, with the kitchen being excessively small and not being served by any windows, thereby being afforded with inadequate natural light, outlook and ventilation, and the rear garden of this unit only appearing to be accessible via this unit�s bedrooms, would provide prospective occupants with a substandard form of accommodation. In addition, notwithstanding the specified bedroom sizes within the submitted Design and Access Statement, Bedroom 2 of the ground floor flat would be sized far closer towards a double bedroom than a single bedroom with the configuration easily enabling the unit to be occupied by 4.no occupants, following which the overall gross internal floor area of the unit would fail to comply with the prescribed space standards set out within the London Plan and Nationally Described Space Standards issued by the Department for Communities and Local Government on 27th March 2015. Furthermore, in the absence of section drawings detailing the internal head heights of units, the Council cannot be satisfied that the units would be provided with sufficient internal head heights. The proposed development would therefore give rise to substandard and poor quality accommodation to the detriment of the residential amenities of the future occupiers of the units contrary to policies D3 D (7), D6 D, D6 F (1) and (8) of The London Plan (2021), policies DM1 B (f), DM1 C, DM1 D (f) and (g), DM26 A (a), (c), and (d), and DM26 E of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013), the Mayor of London Housing Supplementary Planning Guidance (2016), Department for Communities and Local Government Technical Housing Standards � Nationally Described Space Standards (2015), and the adopted Supplementary Planning Documents Residential Design Guide (2010)."
