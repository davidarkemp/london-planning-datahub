    "Reason : 1 - The proposal by reason of the shortfall in the minimum gross internal floor area of ground floor flat 1, inappropriate stacking between the bedrooms and kitchens of flats 2 and 3, and the roof level flat failing to provide a minimum floor to ceiling height of 2.3m for at least 75% of the Gross Internal Area, would result in an overall cramped and substandard quality of living accommodation for the future occupiers of the flats, to the detriment of their residential amenities, and would fail to provide a fit for purpose residential units of an appropriate design, quality and layout, contrary to Policies D3.D(7) and D6 of The London Plan (2021), policies DM1 and DM26 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013), the Technical Housing Standards Nationally Described Space Standards (2015), Housing Design Standards London Plan Guidance (2023) and the adopted Residential Design Guide Supplementary Planning Document (2010).",
    "Reason : 2 - The development, by reason of the relationship between flat 1 and flat 2, the side habitable windows to flat 1, and the access to the amenity spaces of flat 1 and flat 2, would result in mutual loss of privacy and overlooking to the potential future occupiers of both flats, to the detriment of their residential amenity, contrary to National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies D3.D.7 and  D6 of the London Plan (2021), Policies DM 1 and DM 26 of the Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013), The  Mayor of London Housing Supplementary Planning Guidance (2016), the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010) and Housing Design Standards LPG (2023).

    "Reason : 3 - The proposal, by reason of the lack of private amenity space for flat 3, would result in a poor standard of living accommodation for future occupiers of the flat, to the detriment of their residential amenities,  contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021), Policies DM 1, DM 26 and DM 27 of the Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013), The  Mayor of London Housing Supplementary Planning Guidance (2016), the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010) and Housing Design Standards LPG (2023).

    "Reason : 4 - The proposal, by reason of the lack of side access to the rear garden, would result in the refuse and waste recycling bins and bicycle stores, being located in the front garden area, resulting in a cluttered and poor quality environment, to the detriment of the character and appearance of the subject property and the streetscene, contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Core Policy CS.1B, Policies D3.D11 and T5 of the London Plan (2021), Policies DM 1, DM 26, DM42 and DM45 of the Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010)."
