    "Reason : 1 - The proposed single and two storey rear extensions by reason of its siting, excessive rearward bulk and scale would harm the neighbouring amenity of No.45 Parkside Way by way of harmful visual intrusion and overbearing impacts when viewed from the rear of this neighbour, to the detriment of the residential amenities of the occupiers of this neighbouring dwelling. This would be contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023) policy D3.D(7) of The London Plan (2021), policy DM1 of the Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010)."
