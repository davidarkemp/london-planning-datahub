    "Reason : 1 - Insufficient details have been submitted in relation to Flood Risk Assessment. The applicant has therefore failed to demonstrate that the future occupiers of the proposed development would not be exposed to unacceptable levels of flood risk within the site and adjacent to the site, contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2023), Policy SI12 of the London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1U of Harrow Core strategy (2012) and Policy DM9 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed internal layout, by reason of the siting of the windows and the depth of the living/dining  room, would fail to provide future occupiers with adequate levels of natural light. The proposal would therefore be contrary to paragraph W(2A) to Part 3 (of Schedule 2) of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) (Amendment) Order 2015 (as amended) and would give rise to substandard and poor quality accommodation to the detriment of the residential amenities of the future occupiers of the unit contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2023), policies D3 D (7) of The London Plan (2021), and policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013).",
    "Reason : 3 - Insufficient information has been provided to enable the Local Planning Authority to determine whether the proposed development complies with Part Class O, paragraph O.1 (b) (i) and (ii) of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015. That is that the building was used for a use falling within Class B1(a) (offices) of the Schedule to the Use Class Order on 29th May 2013 (or in the case of a building which was in use before that date but was not in use on that date, when it was last in use) or that the existing lawful use of the building would allow the development to benefit from Class O."
