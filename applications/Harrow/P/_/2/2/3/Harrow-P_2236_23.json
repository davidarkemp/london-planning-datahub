    "Reason : 1 - The proposed single storey side to rear extension, by reason its rearward projection and siting, would give rise to a visually overbearing form of development upon the neighbouring occupiers of No.12 Trevone Gardens leading to loss of outlook to the detriment of the amenities of the neighbouring occupiers at No.12. The proposed development is therefore contrary to Policy D3(D(7)) of The London Plan (2021), policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010)."
