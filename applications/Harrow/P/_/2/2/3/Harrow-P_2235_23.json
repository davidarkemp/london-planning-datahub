    "Reason : 1 - The proposed replacement windows and the replacement of the door on the front elevation, by reason of the lack of detailed design to demonstrate that the windows would match the existing windows and the lack of survey to demonstrate that the existing windows are beyond repair would result in unacceptable harm to the significance of the locally listed heritage asset and to the character and appearance of The Stanmore Hill Conservation Area, for which there has been no clear and convincing justification nor public benefits demonstrated which would outweigh this harm. The proposal is therefore contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework Paragraphs 192 and 194 (2023), Policy HC1 of The London Plan (2021), Policy CS1.D of the Harrow Core Strategy (2013) and Policy DM7 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Plan (2013)."
