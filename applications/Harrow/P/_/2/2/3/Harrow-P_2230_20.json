    "Reason : 1 - The proposal by reason of the rear dormer not being entirely within the rear roofslope, has not demonstrated that the materials used in the exterior would appear to be of similar appearance to those used in the construction of the exterior of the main roof of the subject dwellinghouse. The proposed development would not therefore be within the tolerances of Schedule 2, Part 1, Class B, B.2 (a) of The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 as amended.",
    "Reason : 2 - The edge of the proposed enlargement closest to the eaves of the original roof would be less than 0.2 metres from the eaves, when measured along the roof slope from the outside edge of the eaves and would therefore not be within the tolerances of Schedule 2, Part 1, Class B, B.2 (b)(i)(bb) of The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 as amended.",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposal is NOT therefore a lawful development."
