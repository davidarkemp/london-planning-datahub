    "Reason : 1 - The proposed first floor front infill extension and associated roof alterations creating an expansive crown roof would result in unduly obtrusive, disproportionate, insubordinate and incongruous additions to the original dwellinghouse which would unduly subsume the dwellinghouseï¿½s distinct original cat slide roof, would excessively alter the host dwelling from its original form, would unbalance the pair of semi-detached properties that the site forms part of, and would appear unduly at odds with the established pattern of development within the locality. Given their extensive massing, unsympathetic design and prominent visibility along the street scene, the proposed front infill extension and associated roof alterations would unduly detract from the overall level of visual amenity afforded along the street scene. The proposal would thereby be contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023), Policy D3 (1) and (11) of The  London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 A, DM1 B (a), (b) and (c) of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010)."
