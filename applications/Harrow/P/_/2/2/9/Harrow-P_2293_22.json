    "Reason : 1 - The proposed window(s) serving the kitchens in flats 1 and 2 by reason of their orientation and siting in relation to the south-eastern site boundary, would fail to provide an adequate means of light and outlook to the detriment of the residential amenities of the potential future occupiers of the flats. The proposal is therefore contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies D3 and D6 of The London Plan (2021), Policies DM1 and DM26 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed window serving the kitchen in flat 2, by reason of its orientation and siting in relation to the south-eastern site boundary, would form an unneighbourly development resulting in perceived and actual overlooking and a loss of privacy to no.103 Harrow View, contrary to the Policies D3 and D6 of The London Plan (2021), Policies DM1 and DM26 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed development by reason of its failure to provide an appropriate unobstructed window to bedroom 2 in flat 3, would result in a poor means of outlook and an overall substandard quality of living accommodation, for the future occupiers of the unit, failing to provide a fit for purpose residential units of an appropriate design, quality and layout, contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies D3.D(7) and D6 of The London Plan (2021), policies DM1 and DM 26 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013), the Technical Housing Standards Nationally Described Space Standards (2015), the Mayor of London Supplementary Planning Guidance (2016), and the adopted Residential Design Guide Supplementary Planning Document (2010).",
    "Reason : 4 - The proposed external alterations, due to the proliferation of front doors within the front elevation of the enlarged property, would give rise to an incongruous and inappropriate form of development interrupting the character of the main house and neighbouring properties, to the detriment of the character and appearance of the dwellinghouses and the established pattern of development in the area. The development therefore fails to meet the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2032), and is contrary to Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1.B of Harrow Core Strategy  (2012), Policies DM1 and DM26 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Harrow Supplementary Planning Document Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 5 - The proposal has failed to demonstrate that 75% of the internal floor to ceiling height of each unit would exceed 2.3m and as such the proposal would create a cramped and poor standard of living accommodation for future occupiers, contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D6 of The London Plan (2021), policies DM 1 and DM 26 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013), the Technical Housing Standards Nationally Described Space Standards (2015), the Mayor of London Supplementary Planning Guidance (2016), and the adopted Residential Design Guide Supplementary Planning Document (2010).",
    "Reason : 6 - The proposed development by failure to provide adequate private amenity spaces for flats 1 and 3, in conjunction with poor and inappropriate sub-division of the garden, would result in a substandard quality of living accommodation to the detriment of the residential amenities of future occupiers of the residential units and would be out of keeping with the character and pattern of development in the area contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021),  policies D3 and D6 of The London Plan (2021), policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), policies DM1 and DM26 of the Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013), the Mayor of London Housing Supplementary Planning Guidance (2016) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010)."
