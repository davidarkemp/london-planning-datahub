    "Reason : 1 - Notwithstanding the proposed occupancy of the new flat as indicated within the Planning Design & Access Statement, by reason of the fact that the proposed bedroom would be appropriately sized to form a double bedroom, officers have considered the unit to form an 1-bedroom 2-person 1-storey flat, with the overall gross internal floor area of the unit failing to comply with the nationally prescribed space standards issued by the Department for Communities and Local Government on 27th March 2015. The proposal would therefore be contrary to paragraph 3(9A)(b) of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) (Amendment) Order 2015 (as amended) and would provide an unacceptable standard of residential accommodation for future occupiers contrary to the high quality design aspirations of The National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policy D6 of The London Plan (2021), policy CS1 of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), policies DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Residential Design Guide Supplementary Planning Document (2010)."
