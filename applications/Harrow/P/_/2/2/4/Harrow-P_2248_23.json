    "Reason : 1 - The proposed first floor side and rear extensions together with the proposed raised hipped roof and crown roof, by reason of their excessive combined width, bulk and massing, would form incongruous, discordant, contrived, unduly bulky and dominant additions to the host dwelling, which would fail to positively respond to the original architecture of the host building and would subsume the original dwellinghouse. The proposal would thereby be contrary to the high-quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023), Policy D3.D (1) and D3.D(11) of The London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).
