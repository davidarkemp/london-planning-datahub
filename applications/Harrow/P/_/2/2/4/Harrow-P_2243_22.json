    "Reason : 1 - The proposed extension of the roof above the existing side to rear extension to form an end gable together with the rear dormer, by reason of their combined excessive scale, bulk and poor roof design would give rise to an contrived and incongruous form of development and result in excessive and overly dominant extensions which would fail to respect the proportions and scale of the original dwellinghouse and would subsume the original dwellinghouse. The proposal is therefore contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), policies D1 and D3 of The London Plan (2021), policy CS1.B on the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), policy DM1 of the Development Management Local Plans Policies (2013) and adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010)."
