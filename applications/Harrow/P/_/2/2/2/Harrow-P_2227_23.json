The proposed use of premise would be to a supported living accommodation for six persons (6 bed) (Use Class C3(b)). Both uses fall within the same Use Class as defined in the Town and Country Planning (Use Classes) Order 1987 (as amended). The proposed use of the property as a residential care home would therefore not constitute a material change of use, and would not constitute development as defined by section 55 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended) and as defined by Article 3 sub-paragraph (1A) of the Town and Country Planning (Use Classes Order) 1987 (as amended).",
