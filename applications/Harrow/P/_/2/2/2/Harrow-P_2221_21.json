    "Reason : 1 - The applicant's submitted drawings fail to reflect the dwellinghouse's existing form and appearance. In the absence of accurate existing elevation and floor plan drawings, the applicant has failed to sufficiently demonstrate that the proposed hip to gable roof extension, rear dormer roof extension, front roof lights and new flank loft floor window would comply with the requirements of Classes B and C of Schedule 2, Part 1, of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "Reason : 2 - The original eaves of the rear roof slope would be removed and subsumed by the ground floor rear extension detailed on both the existing and proposed plans and elevations, the eaves of the rear roof slope are not indicated to be reinstated. The proposed rear dormer roof extension would fail to be set back 0.2 metres from the eaves of the rear roof slope. The proposed development would therefore fail to comply with Condition B.2 (b) (i) (aa) and (bb) of Schedule 2, Part 1, Class B of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposal is therefore not a lawful development."
