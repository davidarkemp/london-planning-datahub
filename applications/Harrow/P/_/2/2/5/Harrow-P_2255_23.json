    "Reason : 1 - The proposal, by reason of its height and width in conjunction with its siting would result in the loss of important open verge adjacent to Alexandra Avenue and would be an unduly bulky, conspicuous, obtrusive and poorly designed development which is incongruous in appearance, at odds with the character of the area and the prevailing pattern of development in the streetscene on the southern side of Eastcote Lane. Furthermore, the development would break the visual alignment and verdant character of prominent grass verges running the length of Alexandra Avenue and would therefore be harmful to the character and appearance of the locality and the visual amenity of neighbours, contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023), Policies D3.D(1), D3.D(7) and D3.D(11) of The London Plan (2021), policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), policies DM1 and DM23 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).\r\n"
