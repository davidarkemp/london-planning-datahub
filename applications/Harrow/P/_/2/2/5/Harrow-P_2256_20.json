    "Reason : 1 - The proposal would rely on land which is outside of the area of the site location plan outlined in red, to provide the extension to the building and the rear balconies and terrace.  It therefore does not fall within the tolerances of article 7(1)(c)(i) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure (England) (Order) 2015 as amended.",
    "Reason : 2 - Notwithstanding the above reason, the proposal, by reason of unsatisfactory stacking arrangement would create a poor standard of living accommodation for future occupiers.  The proposal is therefore contrary  to the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), Policies 3.5C and 7.6B  of The London Plan 2016, Policies DM1  and DM26 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013), the Mayor of London Housing SPG (2016), the Technical Housing Standards Nationally Described Space Standards (2015) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposal, by reason of its increase in width and height and its close proximity to the site to the east, would result in an unacceptable loss of amenity in terms of loss of light, outlook and privacy to potential future occupiers of a neighbouring scheme with extant permission at No. 19a High Street Wealdstone to the east. contrary to policy 7.6 B of The London Plan (2016), Policy D3 of the Intend to Publish London Plan (2019) and Policy DM 1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Development Plan Document (2013)."
