    "Reason : 1 - The proposed extensions and alterations to the building, including the basement and outbuilding, by reason of their excessive volume, internal floor space, and footprint, would result in disproportionate additions over and above the size of the original building and would therefore constitute an inappropriate development within the Green Belt, to the detriment of the character and openness of the Green Belt contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy G2 of The London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1.F of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM16 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013), and no very special circumstances have been demonstrated by the applicant whereby the harm by reason of inappropriateness is outweighed by other considerations.",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed two storey side extensions, first floor rear extension, rear balcony, roof alterations and front dormer by reason of the enlarged roof form, cumulative bulk, mass and scale would fail to provide subordinate and harmonious additions to the host dwellinghouse which would result in overly dominant, obtrusive, and incongruous form of development that serves to erode and subsume the character of the original and existing dwellinghouse, and forms a significantly stark contrast to the low character of the adjacent bungalows, contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D3.D(1) and (11) of the London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed second floor rear balcony by reason of its siting and formation would result in overlooking of the rear gardens of the adjoining properties and result in a perceived or actual loss of privacy to to these adjoining occupiers, to the detriment of the residential amenities, contrary to Policy D3.D(7) of the London Plan (2021), Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013), and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010)."
