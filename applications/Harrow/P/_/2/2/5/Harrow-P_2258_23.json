    "Reason : 1 - The proposed extension to the rear detached outbuilding and its use as a self-contained annexe incidental to the main dwelling, by reason of its location in the rear garden, would be out of character and at odds with the layout of the dwellings and pattern of development in the area, and would result in unneighbourly development, and actual and perceived overlooking to the adjoining neighbouring occupiers from associated comings and goings, to the detriment of the character and appearance of the area, and the residential amenities of the neighbouring occupiers, contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023), policy D3.D (1), (7) and (11) of The London Plan (2021), policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010)."
