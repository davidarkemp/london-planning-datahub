    "Reason : 1 - Within the context of the planning permission P/0471/23 dated 13/07/2023, the proposed changes to the internal layout of the HMO, and external changes to introduce boundary treatment in the rear garden, would result in a material change to the nature of the HMO and its provision of appropriate internal and external amenity space for future occupants and neighbouring properties. It would therefore require re-consultation with neighbours, and the proposal would need to be re-assessed against the requirements of The National Planning Policy Framework (2021); Policy D3 and H9 of The London Plan (2021), Policy CS1 of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), and Policies DM1, DM27 and DM30 of the Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013)."
