  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed detached car port by reason of its unacceptable height, solid appearance and inappropriate design and excessive scale and footprint, would appear as an incongruous and visually obtrusive addition to the area that would fail to preserve or enhance the character and appearance of the Pinner Hill Estate Conservation Area, the Special Character Area and result in an inappropriate form of development within a Green Belt. As such, the development would have a detrimental impact upon the open character of this part of the Green Belt by being a inappropriate addition, and adversely affecting the character and appearance of the Conservation Area and Special Character Area, contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policies D3 (D(1) and  D(11)), G2 and HC1 of The London Plan (2021), policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), policies DM1, DM6, DM7 and DM16 of the Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013), the adopted Supplementary Planning Document Residential Design Guide (2010) and the Pinner Hill Conservation Area Management Strategy (2009).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed detached car port by reason of its proximity and siting in relation to the existing mature trees which are considered to be of high amenity value, would lead to the likely encroachment into the root protection areas of these trees and would potentially lead to the risk of survival of these trees and consequently affecting the amenity value of these trees, contrary to policy G7 of The London Plan (2021) and policy DM22 (A and C) of the Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013)."
