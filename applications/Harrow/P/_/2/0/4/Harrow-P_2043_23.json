    "Reason : 1 - The proposed first floor side extension by reason of its lack of set back from the site boundary in conjunction with its prominent corner siting would result in a dominant and incongruous form of development and an uncharacteristic loss of openness to the spatial setting of the locality to the detriment of the character and appearance of the existing dwellinghouse, the streetscene and the established and prevailing pattern of development in the area, contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023), policy D3.D(1) and D (11) of The London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1 B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document Residential Design Guide (2010).",
