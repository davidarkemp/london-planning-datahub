    "Reason : 1 - The proposed rear dormer extension by reason of its significant width and bulk would create an obtrusive and incongruous form of development that would not be subordinate or respect the scale and proportions of the external appearance of the roof and elevation in which the dormer window would be constructed. The development therefore fails to meet the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), and is contrary to Policy D3. D (11)  of the London Plan (2021), Core Strategy Policy CS1.B (2012), Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Harrow Supplementary Planning Document Residential Design Guide (2010)."
