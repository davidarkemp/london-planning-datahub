    "Reason : 1 - The proposal, by reason of its inappropriate, unsympathetic and bulky roof design, including poor fenestration, projecting rooflights, the removal of the original chimney and the uncharacteristic rear Juliet balcony, would introduce a visually obtrusive, and incongruous form of development that would fail to respect the character and appearance of the subject dwellinghouse and the locality, and consequently would fail to preserve or enhance the character or appearance of the Canons Park Conservation Area.  The proposal is therefore contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D3 D (1) (11) and HC1 of the London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1 (B) and (D) of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), policies DM 1 and DM 7 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013), the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010) and the Canons Park Conservation Area Appraisal and Management Strategy.\r\n"
