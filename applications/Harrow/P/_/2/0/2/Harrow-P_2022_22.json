  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The development, by reason of the internal layout of the units, inappropriate stacking between the bedroom and kitchens of the proposed three units and the roof level flat failing to provide a minimum floor to ceiling height of 2.3m for at least 75% of the Gross Internal Area in conjunction with the lack of private amenity space for the upper floor units would result in a cramped and poor standard of living accommodation for future occupiers to the detriment of their residential amenities,  contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021), Policies DM 1 and DM 26 of the Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013), The National Housing Standards-Nationally Described Space Standards (2015), The  Mayor of London Housing Supplementary Planning Guidance (2016), and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed two storey side and part first floor rear extension by reason of their poor roof design and overall bulk and scale would fail to respect the hipped profile of the main roof and would form a dominant, unduly obtrusive and insubordinate addition to the host building resulting in a harmful impact on the character and appearance of the host building and surrounding area and the visual amenities of the surrounding neighbouring occupiers, contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D3 D (1), (7), (11) and (12)  of the London Plan (2021), Core policy CS 1 B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), policies DM 1 and DM 26 of the Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013), and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed rear dormer extension, by reason of its overall excessive width, scale and design and siting including the encroachment onto the roof of the proposed part first floor rear extension would result in a dominant and obtrusive form of development which would have a harmful impact on the character and appearance of the host building and surrounding area and the visual amenities of the surrounding neighbouring occupiers, contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D3 D (1), (7), (11) and (12)  of the London Plan (2021), Core policy CS 1 B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), policies DM 1 and DM 26 of the Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013), and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 4 - The proposed development fails to provide adequate car parking provision for the new 1 bed and 2 bed flats as the proposal would require the mounting of the kerb adjacent to parking permit bays, to the detriment of highway safety in this locality and would also give rise to overspill parking in the surrounding residential roads, which would contribute to congestion and parking stress in the locality, contrary to London Plan (2021) Policies, T4 T6 and T6.1 policy DM1 and DM42 Harrow Development Management Policy (2013).",
    "Reason : 5 - The proposal, by reason of the lack of appropriate siting for refuse and cycle storage facilities,  would  give rise to additional clutter in the street and would fail to provide secure cycle parking which would encourage sustainable travel, to the detriment of the character and appearance of the area, the street scene and sustainable transport objectives, contrary to  the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policy D3 D (2), (4), (5), (7) and policy T5 A (2) of the London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policies DM1, DM45 and DM 42 F of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document Residential Design Guide (2010)."
