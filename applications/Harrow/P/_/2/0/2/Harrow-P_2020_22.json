    "Reason : 1 - The single storey rear extension, by reason of its siting, excessive rearward projection and height, appears highly intrusive and overbearing, and significantly increases the loss of outlook and enclosure to the detriment of the residential and visual amenities of the occupiers of the neighbouring properties at No. 49 and 53 Howberry Road. As such, the proposed development would be contrary to Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021), Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and guidance contained in the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 2 - The raised patio area, by reason of its siting, depth and excessive height, has caused harm to the living conditions of the neighbouring occupiers at No. 49 Howberry Road and their associated private amenity space, in terms of loss of privacy and overlooking. As such, the proposed development is contrary to Policy D3 of The London Plan (2021), Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010)."
