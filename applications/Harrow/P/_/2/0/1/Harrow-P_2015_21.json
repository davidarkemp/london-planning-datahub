    "Reason : 1 - It has not been demonstrated that the use of the existing outbuilding, sited in the rear garden of 58 Chandos Crescent is a use which is ancillary to the residential use of the subject dwelling.  Therefore the form of development in this residential area is out of character with the pattern of development in the locality and incongruous and at odds with the residential character of the area and the prevailing pattern of development in the locality, resulting in harm to the character and appearance of the locality and unacceptable levels of disturbance to the adjoining neighbouring occupiers from associated comings and goings, to the detriment of the character and appearance of the area and the residential amenities of the surrounding neighbouring occupiers, contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), policies SD7 and D3 of The London Plan (2021), policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), policies DM1 and DM35C of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010)."
