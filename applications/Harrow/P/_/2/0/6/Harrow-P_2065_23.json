    "Reason : 1 - The proposed two storey rear extension including the excavation works by reason of the cumulative bulk, mass and scale would fail to provide subordinate and harmonious additions to the host dwellinghouse which would result in overly dominant, obtrusive, and incongruous form of development that serves to erode and subsume the character of the original and existing dwellinghouse, and forms a significantly stark contrast to the low character of the adjacent dwellinghouses, contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023), Policy D3(D(1) and (11)) of The London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed two storey rear extension by reason of its siting, rearward projection and overall massing would result in a bulky and intrusive form of development, which would result in overshadowing, a loss of outlook and visual amenity to the neighbouring occupiers at Nos. 168 and 172 Whittington Way, to the detriment of the residential amenities of these neighbouring occupiers, contrary to Policy D3.D(7) of The London Plan (2021), Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013), and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010)."
