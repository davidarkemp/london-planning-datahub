    "Reason : 1 - The cumulative impact of the proposed first floor rear and side extensions and associated roof alterations including raising the roof ridge, infill hip extension, dormer and crown roofs, together with the ground floor rear extension and conversion of the garage to habitable space, by reason of excessive bulk, scale, massing, poor design and disproportionate and incongruous fenestration would result in an unsympathetic, incongruous, top-heavy and visually intrusive form of development that subsumes and fails to respect the scale, proportions and design of the host building, would not be visually contained, would be out of character with the wider pattern of development and streetscene and would harm the neighbouring amenity of No.19 Blythwood Road by way of harmful visual intrusion. This would be to the detriment of the character and appearance of the subject building, the wider pattern of development and the visual amenities of the wider area and those of No.19 Blythwood Road, contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023) policy D3.D(1), D3.D(7) and D3.D(11) of The London Plan (2021), policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012) and policy DM1 of the Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010)."
