    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development by the reason of its poor design, excessive scale and bulk, would result in an overly dominant, discordant, disproportionate and bulky extension which would fail to respect the proportions and scale of the original dwellinghouse and would result in a loss of visual amenity for the area due to its prominence when viewed from both Orley Farm Road and Wood End Road. The proposed development would therefore fail to preserve or enhance the character and appearance of the South Hill Avenue Conservation Area, contrary to the high quality design aspirations of The National Planning Policy Framework (2019), policies 7.4B, 7.6B and 7.8 C/D of The London Plan (2016), policies D1, D3 and HC1 of The Draft London Plan (2019), policies CS1.B and CS1.D of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), policies DM1, DM6 and DM7 of the Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013), the adopted South Hill Avenue Conservation Area Appraisal and Management Strategy (2008) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 2 - Insufficient information has been provided to fully assess the impact of the proposed development on the adjacent trees. In the absence of this information, the proposed development, by reason of its excessive size and scale would potentially harm the long-term health and longevity of trees and would therefore fail to preserve or enhance the character or appearance of this part of the South Hill Avenue Conservation Area, contrary to policies 7.4B, 7.6B, 7.8 B/C/D and 7.21C of The London Plan (2016), policies CS1.B, CS1.D, G7 and HC1 of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), policies DM1, DM7 and DM22 of the Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013), the adopted South Hill Avenue Conservation Area Appraisal and Management Strategy (2008) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).\r\n"
