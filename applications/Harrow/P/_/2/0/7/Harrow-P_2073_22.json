    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development by reason of its loss of employment land and its siting within a designated Business Use Area, in the absence of satisfactory supporting evidence to justify that the site is no longer suitable and viable for an existing or an alternative industrial or business use, robust and comprehensive supporting continuous marketing evidence without success and a sequential assessment for the release of Business Use Land, would be contrary to the  management of employment land in the Borough and the spatial objectives of the Harrow Development Plan, contrary to policies E4 and E7 of The London Plan (2021), policy CS1(O) of Harrow Core Strategy (2012) and policy DM 31 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed development, by reason of its poor design and massing would give rise to an unsympathetic and bulky form of development which would be out of character with the surrounding area to the detriment of the appearance of the streetscene contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D3 of The London Plan (2021), Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 of the Development Management Plan Local Policies (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed development, by reason of inadequate information regarding servicing arrangements in conjunction with unsatisfactory details of refuse storage capacity, and the siting of refuse and cycle facilities has failed to adequately demonstrate that the development will provide acceptable servicing, refuse and cycle arrangements contrary to National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policies, D3,D6 and T5 of The London Plan (2021), policy CS1 (B) and (X) of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), policies DM1, DM42, DM44 and DM45 of the Development Management Plan Local Policies (2013).",
    "Reason : 4 - The proposed development, by reason of its proximity to the neighbouring dwellings to the north of the subject site and the large windows in the rear elevation in conjunction with its excessive bulk and massing would have an adverse impact on the outlook, sense of enclosure, privacy and visual amenities of these neighbouring dwellings to the significant detriment of their residential amenities, contrary to National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D3.D(7) of the London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1 (B) of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 5 - The proposal, by reason of the lack of provision of private amenity space, inadequate gross internal area and insufficient internal floor to ceiling heights would result in a substandard quality of living accommodation to the detriment of the residential amenities of potential future occupiers, contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policies D3 and D6 of The London Plan (2021), policies DM1 and DM27 of the Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013), the Mayor of London Housing Supplementary Planning Guidance (2016) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 6 - Insufficient information has been provided to demonstrate that the proposed development would be mitigated against any noise or other nuisance to not result in an adverse impact to residential amenities of the potential future occupiers through unacceptable levels of general disturbance. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies D3.D(9), D13 and D14 of the London Plan (2021), and policy DM 1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013).",
    "Reason : 7 - The proposed development by reason of the over-provision of off street parking in conjunction with its high PTAL '6a' location would fail to contribute to the delivery of a modal shift from the private car to more sustainable modes of transport contrary to policies T6 and T6.1 of the London Plan (2021), core policy CS1 (R) of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), and policy DM42 of the Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013).\r\n"
