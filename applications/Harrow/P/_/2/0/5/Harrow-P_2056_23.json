    "Reason : 1 - The proposed single storey front extension incorporating front porch, by reason of its excessive forward projection and width would give rise to an unduly bulky and dominant form of development which would fail to respect the prevailing pattern of development in the locality, to the detriment of the character and appearance of the subject property and the street scene, contrary to the high quality design aspirations of National Planning Policy Framework (2023), Policy D3 D.1 and D.11 of The London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1.B of The Harrow Core Strategy (2012), policy DM 1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed single storey side and rear extension, in conjunction with the extended roof, by reason of excessive rearward projection and siting along the shared side boundary would be unduly obtrusive, result in overshadowing and loss of outlook to the adjoining dwellinghouse, 81 Brancker Road, HA3, to the detriment of the visual and residential amenities of the occupiers of this adjacent property, contrary to Policy D3.D.7 of the London Plan (2021),  Policy DM1 of the Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010)."
