    "Reason : 1 - The proposed two storey rear extension, in conjunction with the existing gable end and large rear dormer roof extensions, would introduce an incongruous, overly dominant and obtrusive form of development that would fail to respect the form and proportions of the existing dwellinghouse, and the character and appearance of the neighbouring properties, to the detriment of the character and appearance of the existing dwellinghouse and the surrounding area, contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023), Policy D3.D (1) and (11) of The London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document Residential Design Guide (2010)."
