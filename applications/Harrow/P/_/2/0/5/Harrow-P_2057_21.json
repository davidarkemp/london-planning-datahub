    "Reason : 1 - The proposed first floor rear extension, in conjunction with the existing roof dormer extension, by reason of inappropriate design, excessive bulk and massing would result in a contrived and incongruous extension that would unacceptably harm the character of the original dwellinghouse and the visual amenities of the area, contrary to policies D3 (D(1) and D(11)) of The London Plan (2021), Policy CS1.B on the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 of the Development Management Local Plans Policies (2013) and  Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed first floor rear extension, by reason of its siting at the boundary with No. 2 Eastern Avenue, would be unduly obtrusive and would result in a loss of light, overshadowing and outlook, to the  detriment  of the visual and residential amenities of the occupiers of the adjacent property no. 2 Eastern Avenue, contrary to Policy D3 (7) of The London Plan (2021), Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and guidance contained in the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010)."
