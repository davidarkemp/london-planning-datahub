    "Reason : 1 - The proposed side dormers, due to their size, would be considered bulky and obtrusive; while the proposed increased height to the garage roof and the height of the rear extensions, due to their height and overlapping with the eaves of the existing roof form, would result in a bulky, awkward and unsympathetic additions to the existing dwelling, which would be detrimental to the character and appearance of the property and the conservation area. There is not clear and convincing justification for the harm, nor public benefits to outweigh them contrary to the requirements of the NPPF paragraphs 199, 200 and 202. The proposed development is therefore contrary to The National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policies D3.D(1) and (11) and HC1. C of The London Plan (2021), Policy CS1.B/D of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), policies DM1 and DM7 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013), the adopted Residential Design Guide Supplementary Planning Document (2010), and the South Hill Avenue Conservation Area Appraisal and Management Strategy (2009).\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposal, due to the siting and excessive height of the single storey rear extension to the garage, would result in undue impacts on the neighbouring property Dunsmore in terms of overshadowing, enclosure and visual impacts, to the detriment of the residential amenities of that neighbouring property. The proposed development is therefore contrary to policy DM1.C and DM1.D of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Residential Design Guide Supplementary Planning Document (2010)."
