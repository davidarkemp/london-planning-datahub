    "Reason : 1 - The established prior approval, ref.no. P/1308/22/PRIOR, is for a single storey rear extension, which is 6m deep, with a 3m maximum height and a 2.9m eaves height. The proposed single rear extension is larger with different dimensions. The proposed single storey rear extension would have an approximately 6 metre depth, an approximately 3.2 metre maximum height, and an eaves height of approximately 3 metres. On the basis that the proposed single storey rear extension has different proportions to the extension proposed under application ref.no. P/1308/22/PRIOR, there is no fall-back position under prior approval for the proposed extension. Taking this into account alongside the fact that the proposed extension would have a single storey and would extend beyond the rear wall of the original dwellinghouse at a depth of over 3 metres it would not be within the tolerances of Schedule 2, Part 1, Class A, A.1 (f)(i) of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposal is therefore NOT a lawful development."
