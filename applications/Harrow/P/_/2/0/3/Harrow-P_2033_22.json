    "Reason : 1 - The proposed single storey front extension by reason of its unacceptable and inappropriate design, its positioning and excessive scale, would appear as an incongruous and visually obtrusive addition to the street scene that would fail to preserve or enhance the character and appearance of the host dwelling, the Pinner Hill Estate Conservation Area and the Special Character Area. As such, the development would have a detrimental impact upon the character and appearance of the Conservation Area and Special Character Area, contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policies D3 (D(1) and D(11)) and HC1 of The London Plan (2021), policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), policies DM1 and DM7 of the Development Management Policies Local Plan 2013, the adopted Supplementary Planning Document Residential Design Guide (2010) and the Pinner Hill Conservation Area Management Strategy (2009)."
