    "Reason : 1 - Within the context of planning application P/2881/21 dated 15/10/2021, the proposed amendments would be a material change with regard to the character and appearance of the property and its impact to neighbouring residential amenities. It would therefore require re-consultation of the neighbouring properties, and the proposal would need to be re-assessed against the requirements of Policy D3 of The London Plan (2021) and Policy DM1 of the Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013). The proposals are therefore not considered to be non-material minor amendments."
