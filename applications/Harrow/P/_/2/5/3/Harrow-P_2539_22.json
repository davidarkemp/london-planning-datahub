    "Reason : 1 - The proposed new dwellinghouse, by reason of its design bulk, scale comprising a three-storey building and flat roof form, would be unduly bulky, imposing, and overbearing. resulting in a development which would be incongruous and at odds with the character of the area and the prevailing pattern of development in the streetscene, to the detriment of the character and appearance of the area, contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policy D3 (D(1) and D(11)) of The London Plan (2021), policy CS1.B of The Harrow Core Strategy (2012) and policy DM1 of the Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013).\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The large windows and third floor terrace by reason of the siting in relation to neighbouring properties at Nos. 9 and 11 High View would give rise to actual and perceived overlooking to the detriment of the residential amenities of these neighbouring occupiers. As such, the proposed is contrary to policy D3 (D(7)) of The London Plan (2021), policy CS1.B of The Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document Residential Design Guide (2010).\r\n\r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed new dwellinghouse by reason of its siting within close proximity to the boundary with No.15 High View would result in loss of light and outlook to the facing habitable room on the ground floor of this neighbouring property As such, the proposed is contrary to policy D3 (D(7)) of The London Plan (2021), policy CS1.B of The Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document Residential Design Guide (2010).\r\n"
