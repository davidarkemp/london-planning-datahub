    "Reason : 1 - The proposed extensions, by reason of their excessive width, depth, height and proximity to the rear and side boundaries, would result in a bulk and massing, which would be out of character with its surroundings, and would not respect the proportions and form of the existing and adjoining buildings. The proposal would therefore be contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), Policies 7.4B and 7.6B of The London Plan (2016), Policy D3 of The Draft London Plan Intend to Publish (2019), Core Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposal, by reason of the depth, bulk and siting along the common boundary with No 241 Kenton Lane, would result in an unacceptable loss of sunlight, daylight, overshadowing and outlook to the adjacent neighbours. As such, the proposal would introduce an unneighbourly form of development which would be detrimental to the amenities of the adjoining occupiers, contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), Policy 7.6B of The London Plan (2016), Policy DM 1 of the Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013), and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposal, by reason of the poor outlook to the proposed first floor rear window serving bedroom No 5, would result in a poor standard of living accommodation for future occupants. As such, the proposal would be detrimental to the amenities of future occupants of the extended flat, contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), Policy 7.6B of The London Plan (2016), Policy DM1 of the Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013), and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 4 - The proposal has failed to demonstrate that refuse and recycling storage facilities can be provided within the site for the proposed extended residential unit. As such, the proposal would result in poor living conditions for the future occupiers of the extended unit, contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), Policy 7.6B of The London Plan (2016), Policy DM1 and DM45 of the Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013), and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 5 - The proposal, by reason of the increase in the size of the existing unit to a large five bedroom 10 person family sized unit, and by reason of the poor quality and inadequately sized private external amenity space, would introduce an over intensive form of development which would not  be appropriate in this area, would result in poor living conditions for the future occupants and would  be detrimental to the residential amenities of the neighbouring occupiers by reason of noise and disturbance.  As such, the proposal would be contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), Policies 3.5A and 7.6B of The London Plan (2016), Policies DM 1 and DM27 of the Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013), the London Housing SPG (2016), and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010)."
