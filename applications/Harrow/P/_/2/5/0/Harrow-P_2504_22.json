    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development, when considered with the existing extensions to the host dwelling, by reason of the cumulative size, scale and massing, would result in disproportionate additions to the original dwellinghouse, thereby representing an inappropriate form of development within the Green Belt, contrary to paragraph 149 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021). As such, the proposal fails to comply with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policy G2 of The London Plan (2021), policy CS1.B and CS1.F of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), and policies DM1 and DM16 of Harrow Development Management Policies (2013).\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed front porch canopy by reason of inappropriate design would fail to respect the character and appearance of the host property and would fail to preserve the character and appearance of the Pinner Hill Conservation Area, contrary to the high quality design aspirations of National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D3(D(1),  D(11)) and HC1 of The London Plan (2021), Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policies DM1 and DM7 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013), the guidance contained in the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010) and the Pinner Hill Conservation Area Appraisal and Management Strategy (2008).\r\n"
