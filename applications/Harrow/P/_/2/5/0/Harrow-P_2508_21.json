    "Reason : 1 - The proposed two storey side extension, by reason of its prominent sitting, unacceptable design in particular with regard to its roof form and eaves height, would result in a development that fails to appropriately relate to the form and composition of the original dwellinghouse and would result in an incongruous form of development that would result in the loss of the original roof feature which is considered to be unique feature of the host dwellinghouse and would imbalance the appearance of this dwellinghouse, to the detriment of the character and appearance of the host dwellinghouse. The proposal is therefore considered to be contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D3 (D (1)) and (D(11) of The London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1 (B) of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), policy DM 1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010)."
