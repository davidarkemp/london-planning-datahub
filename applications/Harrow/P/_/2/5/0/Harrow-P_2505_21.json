    "Reason : 1 - The proposal, by reason of the sitting of the balcony on the second floor rear elevation, would result in an unreasonable degree of impacts in terms of perceived and actual overlooking of the adjoining dwellings rear gardens, to the detriment of their residential amenities, contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021),  Policy D3 D (7) of the London Plan (2021), Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposal, by reason of the height, depth and width of the dormer extension and extending over the existing two storey rear extension, would be unduly obtrusive, would lack subservience and would be harmful to the character and appearance of the original dwellinghouse and the adjacent dwellings, and the visual amenity. The proposal would therefore be contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021),  Policy D3 D (1) and (11) of the London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010)."
