    "Reason : 1 - The proposed new subdivision of the external amenity space would result in the boundary treatment sited within close proximity of the proposed ground floor primary rear windows, which would consequently block the outlook and light to the rear habitable window, resulting in unacceptable impact to the approved ground floor flats outlook and daylight. The proposal would result in the provision of sub-standard accommodation to the ground floor flat, contrary to the high quality design aspirations set out in the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policy  D6 (d)  of The London Plan (2021), policy CS1.B on the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), policy DM1 (f) of the Development Management Local Plans Policies (2013) and adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010)."
