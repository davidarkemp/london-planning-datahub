Having been converted into two separate dwellings, comprising two separate self-contained sets of premises for the purpose of a dwelling, would not be considered a \"dwellinghouse\" as defined by the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended). Therefore, the permission granted by Schedule 2, Part 1 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended), \"Development within the curtilage of a dwellinghouse\" would not be applicable for the application site.\r\n",
