    "Reason : 1 - The proposal, by reason of its insufficient gross internal area, including failure to meet the minimum room width and dedicated storage space, in conjunction with the inadequate outlook and access to natural light to the living room, the lack of defensible space to the kitchen window, the lack of private amenity space and bin and cycle storage, and its harmful impact to the host property in terms of loss of privacy to the rear garden, would give rise to poor and substandard living conditions for the potential future occupiers of the proposed residential unit, and for the occupiers of the host dwelling. The proposal is therefore contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D3(7) and D6 of The London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1, DM27, DM26, and DM45, of the Development Management Policies Plan Local (2013), the Mayor of London Housing Supplementary Planning Guidance (2016) and the Adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposal, by reason of its siting and narrow form, would introduce an inappropriate form of development which would fail to respect the  prevailing pattern of development within the surrounding area, contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D3(1)(11) of The London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Plan (2013), and the Adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010)."
