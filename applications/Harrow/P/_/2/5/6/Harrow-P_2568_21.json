    "Reason : 1 - By reason of inaccurate plans, the Council has not been able to comprehensively assess the impact of the existing development on the character and appearance of the Little Common Conservation Area and the locally listed building.  The  applicant has therefore not demonstrated that the existing development would conserve, and would not harm the character and  appearance of the Little Common Conservation Area and the locally listed building. The proposal is thereby contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D3 D (1), D3.D (11) and D3.D (12) and HC1 of the London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1 (B) and (D) of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), policies DM 1 and DM 7 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013), the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010) and the Little Common Conservation Area Appraisal and Management Strategy (2013)"
