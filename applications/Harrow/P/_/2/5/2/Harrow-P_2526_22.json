    "Reason : 1 - The proposal by reason of the rear dormer not being fully contained within the rear roofslope, has not demonstrated that the materials used in the facing side elevations of the rear dormer, when viewed from ground level, would appear to be of similar colour and design to the materials used in the main roof of the subject dwellinghouse. The proposed development would not therefore be within the tolerances of Schedule 2, Part 1, Class B, B.2 (a) of The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 as amended.\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposal would result in roof space which would exceed the cubic content of the original roof space by more than 50 cubic metres. The proposal is therefore not within the tolerances of Schedule 2, Part 1 Class B, B.1(d) (ii) of The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 as amended.\r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposal fails to demonstrate that the proposed window inserted in the gable end wall of the dwellinghouse would be obscure-glazed, and non-opening more than 1.7 metres above the floor of the room in which the window is installed, contrary to Schedule 2, part 1, Class B, B.2(c)(i) and (ii)  of The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development)(England) Order 2015 as amended."
