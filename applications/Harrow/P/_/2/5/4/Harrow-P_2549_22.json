The submitted details therefore fail to satisfy the requirements of Condition 2 of planning application P/0802/20/PRIOR, in the absence of which the proposal fails to ensure that adequate precautions are taken to avoid noise nuisance for the future occupiers of this site and to safeguard the amenity of neighbouring residents. The proposals have therefore failed to demonstrate compliance with Condition 2, contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D14 of The London Plan (2021), policy CS1 of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012) and policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013)."
