    "Reason : 1 - The proposal would result in two dwellinghouses being sited on garden land. As such, the principle of the development is contrary to the Harrow Core Strategy of directing new residential and other development to the Harrow and Wealdstone Opportunity Area, town centres and, in suburban areas, to strategic previously developed sites and would therefore harm its implementation, contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), Policy 3.5.A of The London Plan (2016), Policies CS1.A and CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012) and the Adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Garden Land Development (2013).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed semi-detached dwellinghouses, by reason of their siting, height, their poor design and cramped form, would interrupt the pattern and grain of development within the existing streetscene. The development therefore fails to meet the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), and is contrary to policies 7.4 B and 7.6 B of The London Plan (2016), Policy D4 of the Draft London Plan Intend to Publish (2019), Core Strategy Policy CS1.B (2012), policy DM 1 of the Harrow Development Management Pont - Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed dwellinghouses, by reason of their siting and their height, and their proximity to the side and rear boundaries, would result in a loss of privacy for occupiers at No 24 St Pauls Avenue and No 2 Ruskin Gardens, by way of overlooking and perceived overlooking from proposed ground and first floor rear and side windows, and would result in an overbearing impact for the neighbours at No 22 and No 24 St Pauls Avenue, by way of loss of outlook and light, visual intrusion and overshadowing, contrary to Policy 7.6B of The London Plan (2016), Policy DM1 of the Development Management Plan Local Policies (2013) and the Adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "Reason : 4 - The proposed dwellinghouses, by reason of their siting and proximity to the rear boundary, and by reason of the inadequate gross internal floor area and inadequate light to the rear bedroom within House B, would result in cramped and poor living conditions, to the detriment of the residential amenities of potential future occupiers, contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), Policies 3.5C and 3.8B of The London Plan (2016), Policy DM1 of the Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013), the Technical Housing Standards Nationally Described Space Standards (2015), the Housing Supplementary Planning Guidance: The Mayor of London (2016), and the Adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010)."
