    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development, by reason of its poor architectural design, particularly the height of the proposed building would fail to respect the external appearance and design of the existing dwelling and would fail to respect the prevailing character in the streetscene. The development would therefore fail to meet the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D3 (D(1) and D(11)) of The London Plan (2021), policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document Residential Design Guide (2010), and would therefore not be within the tolerances of Condition A.A.2(3)(a)(ii) of Class AA of Part 1, Schedule 2 of the General Permitted Development Order (2015) as amended."
