    "&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;&gt;The proposed first floor rear extension by reason of its excessive width and depth would result in a cramped, disproportionate and incongruous addition to the dwellinghouse which would fail to respect the proportions of the host property. The proposed development would result in a detrimental impact to the character and appearance of the host property and would break the established building line of the group of dwellings the site forms part of&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;(No.63, 65 and 67), thereby resulting in a detrimental impact to the visual amenities of the area. The proposal is therefore contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023), D3.D(1) and D3.D(11) of The London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).&lt;/p&gt;",
