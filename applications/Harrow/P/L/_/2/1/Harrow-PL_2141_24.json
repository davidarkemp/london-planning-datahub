    "&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;The existing outbuilding, by reason of its inclusion of\r\nprimary living facilities and by reason of its general design, cramped backland\r\nsiting and uncharacteristic positioning, would form an incongruous,\r\nunsympathetic and contrived development with the appearance of the separate\r\nstandalone dwelling, directly accessible from Malvern&amp;nbsp; Avenue, which would appear unduly at odds\r\nwith the established pattern of residential dwelling development in the area\r\nand would have the appearance of Garden Land Development, of the type which is\r\ngenerally resisted within the borough. It would be of a design and appearance\r\nwhich is out of character, at odds with the appearance of the wider area and\r\nadversely impacts upon the overall visual amenity of the wider area. The\r\nproposal would therefore give rise to an inappropriate form of development on\r\nGarden Land and be contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the\r\nNational Planning Policy Framework (2023), Policies D3.D(1) and D3.D(11) of The\r\nLondon Plan (2021), Core Policies CS1.A and CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy\r\n(2012), Policy DM1 A., DM1 B. (a), (c) and (d), of the Harrow Development\r\nManagement Policies Local Plan (2013), the adopted Supplementary Planning\r\nDocument: Residential Design Guide (2010) and the adopted Supplementary\r\nPlanning Document: Garden Land Development (2013).&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;"
