    "&lt;p&gt;From the plans submitted, the drawings demonstrate a rear dormer much smaller in scale than the rear dormer currently in-situ on site. As&amp;nbsp;such, the local planning authority is therefore unable to make a comprehensive and objective assessment of the proposed development. The proposal would therefore be contrary to policies DM1 of the Development Management Policies Local Plan document (2013),&amp;nbsp;Policies D1, D3, D4&amp;nbsp;of The London Plan (2021), Policies DM1 A, B (a), (b) and (c) of the Development Management Policies Local Plan document (2013) and the relevant provisions of the adopted Harrow Supplementary Planning Document Residential Design Guide (2010).&lt;/p&gt;",
    "&lt;p&gt;The proposed first floor rear extension&amp;nbsp;would result in an inappropriate roof form that would intersect the existing rear dormer creating a development considered to be an&amp;nbsp;unduly obtrusive and incongruous addition to the original dwellinghouse resulting in&amp;nbsp;cumulative overdevelopment of the site, failing&amp;nbsp;to respect the character and proportions of the dwellinghouse and the visual amenities of the locality. The proposal would therefore be contrary to the high quality design aspiration of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023), Policy D3 (D.1 and D.11) of The London Plan (2021), Policies DM1 A, B (a), (b) and (c) of the Development Management Policies Local Plan document (2013) and the relevant provisions of the adopted Harrow Supplementary Planning Document Residential Design Guide (2010).&lt;/p&gt;"
