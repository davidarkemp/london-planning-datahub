    "&lt;p&gt;The proposed first floor side to rear extension, with particular reference to its roof form, awkward relationship with the existing rear dormer; positioning outside of the original dwelling&#x27;s limits adjacent to the shared boundary and contribution to the cumulative overdevelopment of the host property, is considered non-subservient and not to effectively integrate with the host property overall; thus creating an incongruous, poor quality design to the rear of the property. It is therefore considered contrary to the high-quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023), Policy D3 of The London Plan (2021), Policy CS.1B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 of the Development Management Plan Local Policies (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).&lt;/p&gt;"
