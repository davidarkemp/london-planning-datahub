    "&lt;p class=&quot;Default&quot;&gt;The\r\nproposal, by reason of its inclusion of primary living facilities, lack of evidence\r\nto demonstrate that the use would be ancillary and by reason of its independent\r\naccess from the front curtilage and its capacity to operate as a self contained\r\nunit, would result in an inappropriate use on site which would be detrimental to\r\nthe character and appearance of the dwelling and the locality. The proposal\r\nwould also give rise to inappropriate form of development on garden land. The\r\nproposal would therefore be contrary to the high quality design aspirations of\r\nthe National Planning Policy Framework (2023), Policies D3.D(1) and D3.D(11) of\r\nThe London Plan (2021), Core Policies CS1.A and CS1.B of the Harrow Core\r\nStrategy (2012), Policy DM1 A., DM1 B. (a), (c) and (d), of the Harrow\r\nDevelopment Management Policies Local Plan (2013), the adopted Supplementary\r\nPlanning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010) and the adopted\r\nSupplementary Planning Document: Garden Land Development (2013).&lt;/p&gt;"
