    "&lt;p&gt;The excessive depth, height and siting on the shared side boundary of the proposed rear extension, in combination with existing two storey rear extension, would create an overly large, non-subservient cumulative rear development that fails effectively integrate with the host property. It is therefore considered contrary to the high-quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2024), Policy D3 of The London Plan (2021), Policy CS.1B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 of the Development Management Plan Local Policies (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).&lt;/p&gt;",
    "&lt;p&gt;The&amp;nbsp; proposed full width rear extension, with particular reference to its substantial depth, height above the sloping natural ground level and siting on the shared boundary, would create an unacceptable sense of enclosure, unduly restricts daylight/sunlight and impacts the outlook of neighbouring ground floor windows and garden area to both sides, contrary to the Policy DM1 of Harrow’s Development Management Policies Local Plan document (2013); Policy GR1 of Harrow’s Emerging Local Plan (2024); and Harrow’s Residential Design Guide SPD (2010).&lt;/p&gt;"
