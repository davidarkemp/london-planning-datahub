Thus, the scheme has failed to demonstrate that the proposed development would not exacerbate the risk of flooding within the site or increase the risk and consequences of flooding elsewhere, contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2023), policies SI12 and SI13 of The London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1 U of Harrow Core Strategy (2012) and policies DM9 and DM10 of the Harrow Development Management Polices Local Plan (2013).&lt;/p&gt;",

The proposal is therefore\r\ncontrary to the high-quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy\r\nFramework (2023), Policies D3 of the London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1.B of\r\nthe Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development\r\nManagement Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning\r\nDocument: Residential Design Guide (2010).&lt;/p&gt;",
