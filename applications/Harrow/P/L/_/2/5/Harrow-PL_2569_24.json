    "&lt;p&gt;The proposal, by reason of its inclusion of primary living facilities, lack of evidence to demonstrate that the use would be\r\nancillary and by reason of its independent access from the front curtilage and its capacity to operate as a self contained unit,\r\nwould result in an inappropriate use on site which would be detrimental to the character and appearance of the dwelling and\r\nthe locality. The proposal would also give rise to inappropriate form of development on garden land. The proposal would\r\ntherefore be contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2024), Policies\r\nD3.D(1) and D3.D(11) of The London Plan (2021), Core Policies CS1.A and CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012),\r\nPolicy DM1 A., DM1 B.
