    "The proposed two-storey side extension to the northeastern elevation of the host dwellinghouse, would create an unacceptable sense of dominance and enclosure on the neighbouring property at No. 5 Hazelcroft, also obstructing sunlight access and creating additional shading on their outdoor side patio and bedroom window at their existing single storey side extension. The proposal is therefore contrary to Core Policy CS1 of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies (2013) and the Supplementary Planning Document - Residential Design Guide (2010).&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;",
    "The proposed extensions completely overwhelm the existing appearance of the dwellinghouse and harm the streetscape amenity through the loss of openness maintained between neighbouring properties. The proposal is therefore harmful to the streetscape amenity of Hazelcroft and to the general residential amenity of the surrounding context, contrary to Paragraph 131 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023), Core Policy CS1 of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies (2013) and the Supplementary Planning Document - Residential Design Guide (2010).&nbsp;"
