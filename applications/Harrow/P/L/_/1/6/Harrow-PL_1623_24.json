    "&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;&gt;The proposed two storey side to rear extension, by reason of its siting adjacent to the site boundary and lack of set back of the first floor side element and lack of roof set down, would result in a cramped and obtrusive form of development. This would lead to loss of openness in this prominent corner site and fail to respect the character and appearance of the site and the prevailing pattern of development in the local area. As such, the works would be contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023), Policy D3 D.1 and D.11 of The London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;"
