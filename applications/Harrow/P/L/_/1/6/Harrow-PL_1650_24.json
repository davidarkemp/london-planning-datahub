    "The proposed side lean-to and rear canopy structures, by reason of their insensitive design, excessive occupation along the common boundary and a retained gap between proposed roof eaves and the existing fence line along the common boundary, would be harmful to the amenity of the neighbouring occupiers at No. 26 Meredith Close, due to the creation of a false sense of overlooking and intrusiveness towards the neighbouring property and poor-quality design adjoining a residential premise. The proposal is therefore contrary to Core Policy CS1 of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies (2013) and the London Borough of Harrow’s Supplementary Planning Document - Residential Design Guide (2010).&amp;nbsp;",
    "The proposed side lean-to and rear canopy structures, by reason of the finished white fascia board roof form for the side lean-to canopy, excessive and disproportionate siting of the canopies at the side and rear of the property, and the insensitive design treatment along the common boundary with No. 26 Meredith Close, would result in poor-quality, and incongruous design elements harming the surrounding residential context and architectural integrity of the host dwellinghouse. The proposal is therefore contrary to Paragraph 131 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023), Core Policy CS1 of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies (2013) and the London Borough of Harrow’s Supplementary Planning Document - Residential Design Guide (2010).&amp;nbsp;"
