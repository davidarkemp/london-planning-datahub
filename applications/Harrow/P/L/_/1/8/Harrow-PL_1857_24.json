    "&lt;p&gt;The proposed two storey side to rear extension together with the proposed end gable and rear dormer, by reason of their excessive combined width, bulk and massing would cumulatively form incongruous, discordant, contrived, unduly bulky and dominant additions to the host building, which would appear unduly at odds with the established pattern of development along the street scene and within the wider area, thereby detracting from the overall level of visual amenity afforded. The proposal would therefore be contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023) policy D3.D(1), and D3.D(11) of The London Plan (2021), policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012) and policy DM1 of the Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;"
