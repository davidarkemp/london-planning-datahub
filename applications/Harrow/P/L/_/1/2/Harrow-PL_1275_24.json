This is considered contrary to the high-quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D3 Policy of the London Plan (2021); CS.1 of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 of the Development Management Plan Local Policies (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",
    "&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;The\r\nproposed rear extension, with particular reference to its substantial depth,\r\norientation towards the neighbouring property and immediate proximity to their\r\nshared boundary, creates an unacceptable sense of enclosure, unduly restricts\r\ndaylight/sunlight and impacts the outlook of neighbouring ground floor windows\r\nand garden area of 120 Rowlands Avenue, contrary to the Policy DM1 of Harrow’s\r\nDevelopment Management Policies Local Plan document (2013) and Harrow’s\r\nResidential Design Guide SPD (2010).&lt;font face=&quot;Arial, sans-serif&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;"
