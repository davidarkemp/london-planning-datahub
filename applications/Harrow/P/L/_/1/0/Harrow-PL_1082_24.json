    "&lt;p&gt;The&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style=&quot;line-height: 107%;&quot;&gt;proposed\r\nrear dormer extension by reason of its excessive combined size, scale and bulk,\r\nwould appear incongruous on the rear elevation and&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;line-height: 107%; background-image: initial; background-position: initial; background-size: initial; background-repeat: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial;&quot;&gt; would &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;line-height: 107%;&quot;&gt;give\r\nrise to a disproportionate addition which would fail to respect the proportions\r\nand character of the original building.
