    "&lt;p&gt;The proposed external staircase would create an unacceptable loss of privacy to neighbouring properties, especially in relation to 55 Hindes Road, by virtue of its actual and perceived overlooking into neighbouring gardens; lack of screening and unacceptable feature into the rear garden area. This is considered contrary to the high-quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), CS.1 of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 of the Development Management Plan Local Policies (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).&lt;/p&gt;",
    "&lt;p&gt;The proposed roof dormers, due to their lack of setback from the eaves and projection beyond the proposed roofslope, and the presence of a new and substantial external staircase in a domestic context, are considered incongruous, alien and poor quality features that fail to integrate with the property, the semi-detached pairing and the wider area. This is considered contrary to the high-quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D3 Policy of the London Plan (2021); CS.1 of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 of the Development Management Plan Local Policies (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;"
