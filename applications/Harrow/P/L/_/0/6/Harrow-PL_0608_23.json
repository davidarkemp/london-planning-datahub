    "The proposed development, by reason of its excessive scale,\r\nfootprint, detailed design and siting would result in a development which is\r\nunduly bulky, poorly designed, visually obtrusive and at odds with the\r\nsimplistic semi-rural character and appearance of the Pinner Hill Estate\r\nConservation Area and in addition would result in an inappropriate form of\r\ndevelopment within the Green Belt, to the detriment of the character,\r\nappearance and openness of the Green Belt and the Harrow Weald Ridge Area of\r\nSpecial Character. The proposal would therefore fail to preserve or\r\nenhance the character and appearance of the host building and the Pinner Hill Estate\r\nConservation Area. It would therefore be inappropriate development within the\r\ngreen belt, contrary to the policies contained in the National Planning Policy\r\nFramework (2023), Policies D3, G2, and HC1 of The London Plan (2021), Core\r\nPolicy CS 1 and CS6 of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), policies DM1, DM6, DM7\r\nand DM16 of the Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the\r\nadopted Supplementary Planning Document: Pinner Conservation Areas â€“ Appendix\r\n9: Pinner Hill Estate Conservation Area Character Appraisal and Management\r\nStrategy (2009).",
    "The applicant has failed to provide a site wide and\r\nsite-specific tree impact assessment, protection plan and detailed method\r\nstatement. In the absence of which, the Local Planning Authority is unable to assess\r\nthe potential impact of the proposed outbuilding would have on the survival of\r\nthe trees on or close to the site. The proposal could therefore prejudice the\r\nsurvival of protected trees on or close to the site of amenity value to the\r\ndetriment of the visual amenity of the area contrary to policy D3 and G7 of The\r\nLondon Plan (2023) and policy DM22 of the Development Management Policies Local\r\nPlan (2013)."
