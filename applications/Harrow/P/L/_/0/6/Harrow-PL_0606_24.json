    "&lt;p&gt;The proposed development has the potential to create up to two self-contained flats, by infilling the kitchen wall, to which the flats will be able to function independently of each other. The proposal is therefore contrary to the proposed description of development, application type and supporting information. Furthermore, the applicant has failed to provide any justification to address the potential harmful effects on neighbouring residential amenity, the loss of a family-sized unit, and the amenities of future occupiers. The development is therefore considered to be contrary the National Planning Policy Framework (2023), Policies D3, D6, D12, T5 and T6 of The London Plan (2021), Policy CS.1B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policies DM1, DM26, DM42 and DM45 of the Development Management Plan Local Policies (2013), and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",
    "&lt;p&gt;The proposed two storey side to rear extension, with particular reference to its excessive width, massing, bulk, extended ridge feature and poor roof design, is considered to be non-subservient and fails to effectively integrate with the host dwellinghouse; unbalances the semi-detached pair and creates an incongruous, poor quality design that would impact the wider streetscene. It is therefore considered contrary to the high-quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023), Policy D3 of The London Plan (2021), Policy CS.1B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 of the Development Management Plan Local Policies (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;"
