It would be of a design and appearance which is out of character, at odds with the appearance of the wider area and adversely impacts upon the overall visual amenity of the wider area. The proposal would therefore give rise to an inappropriate form of development&amp;nbsp;and be contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023), Policies D3.D(1) and D3.D(11) of The London Plan (2021), Core Policies CS1.A and CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 A., DM1 B.
