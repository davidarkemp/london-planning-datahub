    "&lt;p&gt;The proposed side extension, with particular\r\nreference to its retained front section of flat roof and the lack of set in\r\nfrom the propertyâ€™s side boundary at first floor level, would feature an incongruous,\r\npoor quality design feature and would enclose the spatial gap between the host dwelling and No.79 Anglesmede Crescent and\r\ntherefore fails to effectively integrate with the property overall, and the\r\nwider streetscene. This is considered contrary to the high-quality design\r\naspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023), Policies D3.D(1)\r\nand D3.D(11) of The London Plan (2021), Policy CS.1B of the Harrow Core\r\nStrategy (2012), Policy DM1 of the Development Management Plan Local Policies\r\n(2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design\r\nGuide (2010).&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;"
