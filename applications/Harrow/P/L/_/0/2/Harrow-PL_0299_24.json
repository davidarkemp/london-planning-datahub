The proposal is therefore contrary to the high quality design\r\naspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023), Policies D1 and\r\nD3 of the London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy\r\n(2012), Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan\r\n(2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design\r\nGuide (2010).&lt;font face=&quot;Arial, sans-serif&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",
