    "&lt;p&gt;The proposed increased ridge height and greater massing at first floor / roof level, with particular reference to the change in roof form on the eastern side of the application property, would create an unacceptable sense of enclosure to the detriment of the outlook at 244 Headstone Lane and their immediate garden areas. This would be contrary to Policy DM1 of Harrowâ€™s Development Management Policies Local Plan document (2013) and the relevant provisions of the adopted Harrow Supplementary Planning Document Residential Design Guide (2010).&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",
    "&lt;p&gt;The new roof form, with particular reference to the\r\ndesign, massing and proportions of its proposed front dormers, would be an overly\r\nbulky and top heavy design that fails to integrate with the property overall and\r\nthe wider streetscene, contrary to the high-quality design aspirations of the\r\nNational Planning Policy Framework (2023), Policy D3&amp;nbsp;of The\r\nLondon Plan (2021), Policy CS.1B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1\r\nof the Development Management Plan Local Policies (2013) and the adopted\r\nSupplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).&lt;/p&gt;"
