    "&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: normal;&quot;&gt;The\r\nproposed first floor side extension, by reason of its overall scale, siting and position\r\nwould result in the enclosure of the gap between the host dwelling and the\r\nboundary shared with No. 79 Belmont Lane. This would adversely affect the overall\r\ndetached character and appearance of the host dwelling and its contribution to\r\nthe wider street scene and would detract from the established pattern of\r\ndevelopment within the immediate area. As such, the proposal is therefore\r\nconsidered contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023), policy D3 (D(1) and D(11)) of The London Plan\r\n(2021), policy CS1.B of The Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 of the\r\nHarrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted\r\nSupplementary Planning Document Residential Design Guide (2010).&lt;/p&gt;",
    "&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: normal;&quot;&gt;The proposed roof alterations would result\r\nin an enlarged roof space and revised roof profile that would dwarf the\r\nexisting gable fronted roof. This would not respect the host dwelling and would\r\nfail to be a subservient addition to the original dwelling and would adversely impact\r\nupon the character and appearance of the host dwelling. As such, the proposal is therefore considered contrary to the high\r\nquality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023),\r\npolicy D3 (D(1) and D(11)) of The London Plan (2021), policy CS1.B of The\r\nHarrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management\r\nPolicies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document\r\nResidential Design Guide (2010).&lt;font face=&quot;Arial, sans-serif&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;"
