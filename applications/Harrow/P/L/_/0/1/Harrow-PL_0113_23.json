    "&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;The\r\nproposed extensions, by virtue the harm to the special character and appearance of the conservation area and locally listed Pinnerwood Cottage, and setting of the locally listed Pinnerwood Farmhouse and grade II Pinnerwood House, due to the prominent bulky, scale, mass of the large additions to the cottage undermining the characteristic low to medium densities of development and domestic cottage character of the house, loss of architectural coherence in the conservation area, introducing a bulky roof form, and loss of other architectural quality e.g. gable end with neat timber bargeboard. There is not clear and convincing justification for this harm, nor public benefits to outweigh it. As such, it would not preserve the rural character and appearance of the Conservation\r\nArea, interest of the locally listed buildings &amp;amp; special interest of the setting of the Pinnerwood\r\nHouse Listed Building, contrary to the high-quality design aspirations of the\r\nNational Planning Policy Framework (2023), Policies D3 and HC1 of The London\r\nPlan (2021), Policies DM1 and DM7 of Harrow’s Development Management Policies\r\nLocal Plan document (2013); the relevant provisions of the adopted Harrow\r\nSupplementary Planning Document Residential Design Guide (2010); and Pinnerwood\r\nFarm Conservation Area Appraisal and Management Strategy.&lt;font face=&quot;Arial, sans-serif&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",
