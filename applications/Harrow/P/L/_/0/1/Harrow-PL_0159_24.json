    "The proposed outbuilding, by reason of its inclusion of primary living facilities and by reason of its scale, general design, cramped backland siting and uncharacteristic positioning, would form an incongruous, unsympathetic and contrived development with the appearance of the separate standalone dwelling, which would appear unduly at odds with the established pattern of residential dwelling development in the area and would have the appearance of Garden Land Development, of the type which is generally resisted within the borough. &amp;nbsp;The proposal would therefore give rise to an inappropriate form of development on Garden Land and be contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023), Policies D3.D(1) and D3.D(11) of The London Plan (2021), Core Policies CS1.A and CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 A., DM1 B. (a), (c) and (d), of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013), the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Garden Land Development (2013)."
