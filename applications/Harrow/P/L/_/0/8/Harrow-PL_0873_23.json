    "&lt;p&gt;The proposed two storey side to rear extension; single storey rear extension by reason of its siting, projected depth and built form would result in an inappropriate form of development that would negatively impact the residential amenity of no. 14 West Drive contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023), Policy D3 (D(1) and (11)) of The&amp;nbsp; London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 A, DM1 B (a), (b) and (c) of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",
    "&lt;p&gt;The proposed part single and part two storey side to rear extensions, two storey front infill extension and raised ridge height, by reason of their excessive depth and by reason of the height and roof form of the proposed two storey front and rear extensions, would result in a scale, bulk and massing which would dominate and subsume the proportions of the subject dwelling, and would fail to preserve or enhance the character or appearance of West Drive and Bellfield Conservation Area. There is not clear and convincing justification for the harm, nor public benefits to outweigh this harm. The proposed development is therefore contrary to the requirements of paragraphs 200, 201, 203, 205, 206, 208 and 212 of National Planning Policy Framework (2023), Policies D3.D (1), D3.D (11) and HC1 of The London Plan (2021), Policies CS1.B and CS1.D of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policies DM1 and DM7 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013), the Adopted Supplementary Planning Document Residential Design Guide (2010).&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",
    "&lt;p&gt;The proposed rearward extensions and rear patio would be sited within close proximity to various protected trees within the rear garden,&amp;nbsp;in the absence of an Arboricultural Impact Assessment and Tree Protection Plan, the Council cannot be satisfied that the health of surrounding trees would not be compromised as a result of the development and its construction. The proposed development is thereby considered to be contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the&amp;nbsp;National Planning Policy Framework (2023), Policy G7 of the&amp;nbsp;London Plan (2021), and Policy DM22 of&amp;nbsp;the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013).&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;"
