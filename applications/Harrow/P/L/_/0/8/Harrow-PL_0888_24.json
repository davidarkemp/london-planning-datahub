    "The Flood Risk Assessment provided in support of the application fails to address potential flood mitigation measures necessary to ensure that the proposal would not displace flood waters, worsening flood risk downstream of the property. Owing to the absence of such assessment, Officers are unable to determine that the proposal would not increase the risk or consequences of local flooding and the application is therefore contrary to Paragraph 165 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023), Core Policy CS1 of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012) and Harrow Development Management Policy DM9 (2013).&nbsp;",
    "The proposed single storey rear extension, by reason of its excessive depth and height along the common boundary with neighbours and owing to the existing approximately 6m deep single storey rear extension at No. 52 Clifton Road, would have unacceptable dominance and enclosure effects to the rear of the neighbouring dwellinghouse at No. 50 Clifton Road. Therefore, the proposal is contrary to Harrow Core Strategy Core Policy CS1 (2012), Harrow Development Management Policy DM1 (2013) and the Harrow Supplementary Planning Document - Residential Design Guide (2010)."
