    "&lt;p class=&quot;MsoListParagraph&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: normal;&quot;&gt;The\r\nproposed first floor side to rear extension, in conjunction with the proposed\r\nroof extensions to the property, would result in discordant and ungainly\r\ncumulative additions to the dwelling. In addition, the\r\nproposed rear dormer extension by reason of its significant width, bulk\r\nand mass would dominate the rear roof slope. The dormer extension would fail to\r\nintegrate with vernacular of the existing property, would create an obtrusive\r\nand incongruous form of development which would be at odds, would appear\r\nstrident and would not be subordinate or respect the scale and proportions of\r\nthe external appearance of the roof and elevation in which the dormer window\r\nwould be constructed. The development therefore fails\r\nto meet the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy\r\nFramework (2023), and is contrary to Policy D3.D (1) and (11) of the London\r\nPlan (2021), Core Strategy Policy CS1.B (2012), Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development\r\nManagement Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Harrow Supplementary\r\nPlanning Document Residential Design Guide (2010).&lt;font face=&quot;Arial, sans-serif&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",
