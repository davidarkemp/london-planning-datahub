    "&lt;p&gt;The proposed two storey/ first floor side extension together with the proposed extension of the main roof by reason of their overall scale, width, siting and enclosure of the gap between the host dwelling and the boundary shared with No.28 Chester Drive, would adversely affect the overall semi-detached character and appearance of the host dwelling and its contribution to the wider street scene, and would detract from the established pattern of development within the immediate area.  As such, the proposal is therefore considered contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023), policy D3 (D(1) and D(11)) of The London Plan (2021), policy CS1.B of The Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document Residential Design Guide (2010).&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;"
