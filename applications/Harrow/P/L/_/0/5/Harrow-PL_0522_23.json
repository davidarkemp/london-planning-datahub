    "The proposed single storey rear extension, by reason of its rearward projection and siting, would be overbearing and visually obtrusive and would be detrimental to the amenities of the neighbouring occupiers at No 26 Edward Road, due to a loss of light and outlook, contrary to Policy DM1 of the Development Management Policies Local Plan document (2013) and the relevant provisions of the adopted Harrow Supplementary Planning Document Residential Design Guide (2010).",
    "The proposed first-floor side extension,\r\nby reason of its siting (close proximity to the party boundary with no step-in),\r\nwould create a terracing effect and erode the openness and characteristic\r\nfeatures found throughout the streetscene. Its proposed hipped-roof design and\r\ncombined width would fail to harmonise well with the existing, and would form an incongruous, discordant, contrived, unduly bulky and\r\ndominant addition to the host dwelling and street scene. The proposal would\r\nthereby be contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National\r\nPlanning Policy Framework (2023), Policies D3.D(1) and D3.D(11) of The London\r\nPlan (2021), Core Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policy DM1\r\nA., DM1 B. (a), (b) and (c) of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local\r\nPlan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design\r\nGuide (2010)."
