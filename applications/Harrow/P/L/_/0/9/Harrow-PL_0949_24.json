    "&lt;p&gt;The scheme appears to create up to four self-contained flats, which can function independantly of each other. The proposal is therefore&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;contrary to the proposed description of development, application type and supporting information. Furthermore, the applicant has failed to provide any justification to address the potential harmful effects on neighbouring residential amenity, the loss of a family-sized unit, and the amenities of future occupiers. The development is therefore considered to be contrary the National Planning Policy Framework (2023), Policies D3, D6, D12, T5 and T6 of The London Plan (2021), Policy CS.1B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012), Policies DM1, DM42 and DM45 of the Development Management Plan Local Policies (2013), and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010)&lt;/p&gt;",
