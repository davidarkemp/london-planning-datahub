    "&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNoSpacing&quot;&gt;The&amp;nbsp;proposed side and roof extensions, by reason of their excessive cumulative\r\nscale, massing and lack of a subordinate design would result in an overly dominant on the site with a top heavy and bulky roof form, visually at odds with the prevailing character, and\r\nappearance on the streetscene and the host dwelling. As such, the development is contrary to the high quality design aspirations\r\nof the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D3.D1 and D11 of The\r\nLondon Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1.B of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012),\r\nPolicy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and\r\nthe adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).&lt;/p&gt;"
