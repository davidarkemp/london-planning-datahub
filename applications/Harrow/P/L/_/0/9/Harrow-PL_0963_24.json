    "&lt;p&gt;&lt;span arial=&quot;&quot;&gt;The proposed development is located within surface water flood zone 3a and 3b. In the absence of a satisfactory Flood Risk Assessment, it has not been demonstrated that the proposed development would not exacerbate the risk of flooding within the site or increase the risk and consequences of flooding elsewhere. The proposal would therefore be contrary to National Planning Policy Framework (2023), Policy SI 12 of The London Plan (2021), Core Policy CS1.U of the Harrow Core Strategy (2012) and Policies DM9 and DM10 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",
    "&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li style=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;span arial=&quot;&quot;&gt;The proposed single storey rear extension, by reason of its excessive rearward projection, would result in an obtrusive form of development which would have an unacceptable impact on the neighbouring amenities of No.25 Spencer Road, in terms of overshadowing, loss of outlook and overbearing presence. The proposal would therefore be contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2023), Policy D3 D(7) of The&amp;nbsp; London Plan (2021), Policy DM1 of the Harrow Development Management Policies Local Plan (2013) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide (2010).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br data-cke-eol=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;"
