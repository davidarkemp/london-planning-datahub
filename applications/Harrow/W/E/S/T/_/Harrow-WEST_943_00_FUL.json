    "Reason : 1 - The separate use of this incidental building would be an over-intensive form of occupatiion and an inappropriate form of development, out of character in this area which comprises detached or semi-detached properties.",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposal would represent overdevelopment of the site, by reason of inadequate rear garden depth and amenity space, contrary to the provisions of the Harrow Unitary Development Plan and detrimental to the character of the locality.",
    "Reason : 3 - Car parking cannot be satisfactorily provided within the curtilage of the site to meet the Council's minimum requirements in respect of the development, and the likely increase in parking on the neighbouring highway(s) would be detrimental to the free flow and safety of traffic on the neighbouring highway(s)."
