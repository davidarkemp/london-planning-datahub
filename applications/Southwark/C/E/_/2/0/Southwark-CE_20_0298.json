  "description": "We have a new coffee business on Rye Lane. The property is ground floor, recently renovated and we are looking to serve drinks in the premises on the evenings of Thursday-Saturday to spread awareness of the new business. The public facing message of the coffee bar is 'For Everyone'. We wanted to create a space that is known for having an open door to all its neighbours and guests, with the message filtering down to the diversity of our staff alike. We want to embrace the culture of the area, and never disregard it.",
