  "description": "The premises is a fishmonger, restaurant and we are licensed to operate for takeaway on the street in front of our Building. The premises consists of four floors; the basement, the restaurant floor / kitchen / bar, a preparation area and a storage area. In front of the restaurant, we operate both our takeaway food area and tables and chairs outside (this has been agreed with Lisa York and Ian Law). The ground floor layout (restaurant floor) consists of a wet fish counter at the front, a bar behind where customers can eat or have a drink before they are seated for their meal, the kitchen behind and the rest is situated with tables and chairs. We also have a wheelchair accessible toilet towards the back of the restaurant on this floor. We lease the building from Borough Market and are situated on the outskirts of said market. The application does intend to include both on and off-supplies and this would be for people whom are buying our food and are walking around the market as well as those in our outdoor dining area. This application is for a lapsed premises license due to an admin error on behalf when we changed our company structure. I have kept everything the same or more restricted than our previous license except asking for the addition to be granted off-sales for our alcohol also.",
