  "description": "This is an application to remove conditions 353 and 354. We have had discussions with Andrew Heron in March about this. This is a second licence granted to the then licence holder, which was transferred to Fullers who have purchased the premises, and transferred both licences. Fullers only wishes to operate one licence, and would propose when and if this\rapplication is granted to surrender Premises Licence number 869707 (the other licence). The effect of this application means that both licences will effectively be the same in terms of operating hours, licensable activities and conditions.\rThese conditions were added following the grant of the second licence, and 353 has in fact been complied with, but the surrender of the licence, as mentioned above, will render it obsolete. Similarly, the surrender of the licence will render obsolete also condition 354. The premises are currently closed for a refurbishment. The application promotes the licensing objectives and provides clarity in that it will effectively make this licence the same as the other, and the surrender of the other will leave the one identical licence in place, which is a much simpler position for the Responsible Authorities and the general public.",
