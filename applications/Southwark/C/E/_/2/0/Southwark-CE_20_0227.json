  "description": "Minor Variation to 1) to amend floor plans to show all the premises' doors and all fire fighting and fire detection equipment at the premises. 2) Allow for the provision of off sales at the premises for delivery only, on Sunday to Thursday between 10:00 \u0016 23:30 hours and on Friday and Saturday between 10:00 \u0016 00:30 hours. (These are the same as the existing on sales hours). The following conditions should therefore be added to the license: \rThat all online sales of alcohol will be subject to a real time age verification check before the sale is completed. \rThat all on-line age verification checks must be made by a company which is a member of the Age Verification Providers Association. \rThat all delivery drivers (whether employed directly, as self employed or via third parties) will undertake training regarding age verification to ensure that the required checks are conducted at the point of delivery when a customer appears to be under 25 years old.\rThat in regards to alcohol deliveries, the name used to make the purchase must match the name on the ID provided by the person who the delivery is handed to (and this will be explained at the on-line checkout)\rThat all refusals, relating to age verification, off the sale of alcohol at the premises, orders made online or deliveries will be recorded in a refusals log and the refusal log shall be made immediately available to police and / or council officers on request.\r",
