  "description": "A new installation with new fittings and lighting control system has been installed which provides them with the ability to change the colour of the internal light fittings for each floor (ground to eighth floors).  As a consequence they would like to be able to use this opportunity to highlight some good causes and occasions each year by changing the colour of the internal row of light fittings to the perimeter of the floors on specific days - for exampe changing the perimeter row of light fittings to red for Rememberance Day or to Pink for Breast Cancer awareness day etc.  The intention is to change the colour of the lighting on approximately 20 ad-hoc days of the year (and we are writing on behalf of our client to seek confirmation that neither Advertisement nor Planning Consent would be required in this instance).",
