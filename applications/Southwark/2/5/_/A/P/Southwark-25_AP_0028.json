Works to accord with BS3998\r\rThe reasons for the notification are as follows:\ra.\tThe property has been the subject of movement which engineers consider to be attributable to the role of vegetation on an underlying clay soil.\rb.\tSite investigations confirm the clay soil and levels of desiccation which support the view trees are of influence.\rc.\tThe onset timing of damage is wholly consistent with the potential that it is caused by tree(s).\rd.\tLevel monitoring is supportive of the view vegetation is causal.\re.\tThe tree (T1) identified for removal is the largest/ closest vegetation to the affected part of the building. It is hoped that removal will mitigate the influence and facilitate the retention of other surveyed trees. \rf.\tPruning to T2 seeks to establish a managed canopy framework allow future pruning works which will seek to retain the tree in a managed form. \rg.\tIn the event of a refusal the property will be underpinned at an additional cost of not less than 15-25,000 (ex VAT). This additional expense (and additional legal costs in seeking the claim) will be sought by way of compensation under Reg 24.",
