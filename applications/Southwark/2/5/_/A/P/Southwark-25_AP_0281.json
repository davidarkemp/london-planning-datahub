The amendments include the following:\r - single storey rear extension roof to be replaced with a flat roof. To match the neighbour's existing extension to ensure the junction and detail along the boundary is coherant.  \r - the ridge of the side extension is proposed to follow the line of the existing host dwelling.  This is to ensure there are two side walls that a single ridge beam can be located on top off.  \r - window to the rear first floor bedroom will be replaced with a french doors and juliet balcony in order to match the neighbouring building. \r",
