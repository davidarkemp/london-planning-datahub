In pleached form to provide a boundary screen. To prune back to previous \rpruning points to control size and shape. \rTree ID 5790 A Pittosporum tree approximately 9m in height, situated on the eastern boundary of the rear garden. Reduce height by up to 4m, re-shaping the top for a natural result. Hopefully this will stimulate stronger growth lower down for screening.\rTree ID 5791 A Corsican Pine tree approximately 9m in height, situated on the north-eastern corner of the rear garden. Dead wood to be removed inside the crown and overcrowded areas to be lightly thinned by up to 10% \rTree ID 5792 A Nepalese Pine tree approximately 9m in height, situated on the eastern corner of the rear garden. Minimal trimming of longer lateral growths by up to 0.5m only.\r",
