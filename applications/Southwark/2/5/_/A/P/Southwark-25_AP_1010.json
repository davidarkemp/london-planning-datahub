  "description": "Installation of new air source heat pumps on the second floor flat roof on the southwest (rear) elevation to provide heating and cooling to the building. \rAn acoustic screen will be installed to reduce noise breakout from the heat pumps. The acoustic panels will be finished in a RAL colour to match the existing brickwork as closely as possibly. \rThe new refrigerant pipework will run on the external wall of the building on the southwest (rear) elevation. The pipework will be concealed in \rmetal trunking finished in a RAL colour to match the existing brickwork as closely as possibly.\rThe existing radiators and fan convectors will be replaced with new air conditioning units. The floor mounted units will be concealed in bespoke metal casings.\rSecondary glazing will be fitted to the existing timber frame windows to reduce heat losses and improve the airtightness of the building.\rThe existing non-original lantern roof will be replaced with a new double glazed lantern roof.\rInternal decoration works will be carried out including painting and replacing floor coverings.\rThe original wall mounted shelves with metal legs in the study room will be removed to allow for reconfiguration of the desks. The shelves will only be removed if listed building consent is granted for this item of work.\rWorks will be carried out in the entrance lobby to install a new staff desk and glass doors. A new built-in shelving unit and stair feature will be installed in the Children's library area.\rThe existing kitchenettes in the staff room and community hall will be refurbished. A new toilet will be created on the first floor and the existing toilet areas will be refurbished.\rRemedial works will be carried out internally and externally on the building fabric including window frames, brickwork, roof slates, and roof coverings.",
