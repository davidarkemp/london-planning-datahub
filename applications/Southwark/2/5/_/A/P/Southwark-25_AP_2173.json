  "description": "Works to trees in a Conservation Area: T1 (Silver Birch) - Crown Reduction by 4m.\r\rJustification for Works:\rThe proposed crown reduction of the Silver Birch by up to 4 metres is intended to:\r\rImprove natural light levels into the property and surrounding garden, which are currently significantly affected by the tree?s dense canopy and spread.\rReduce overhang and encroachment towards the property and neighbouring boundaries, helping to maintain a reasonable relationship between the tree and built environment.\r\rPreserve the long-term health and structural balance of the tree through proportional and sympathetic pruning, in line with BS3998:2010 guidelines.\rPrevent future excessive shading and reduce the need for more severe pruning at a later stage by managing the crown size pre-emptively and responsibly.",
