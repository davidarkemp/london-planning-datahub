  "description": "Works to a tree in a conservation area: T1 is a medium sized mature Plane tree growing within a woodland area that grows at the rear of 12 Ropemakers Road. The tree is in full health with no signs of defects when viewing from the ground. All east-facing laterals reach out over into the rear garden of 12 ropemaker road with an extension of 8 metres at the lower laterals.\r\rReasons for the works proposed\rThe client has expressed a desire for a significant cut back of the lower laterals to create more light and give clearance from their property\r- To increase light\r- To lessen leaf litter\r- To lessen the length and sail of overhanging laterals to remove any\rfuture risk of tree failure\r- To lessen its imposing effect on the garden\rDescription of Proposed Works\r- Reduce lower east-facing laterals to suitable growth points at the boundary from 8 metres to 5 metres",
