This specimen was classified as a low-quality tree (Category C) in the Arboricultural Survey conducted in July 2023, indicating limited ecological or biodiversity value and little potential for long-term retention.The oversized shrub poses several practical issues - it partially blocks the main access to the driveway and restricts entry for taller vehicles. It also significantly reduces natural light to both the garden and the interior of the home. Furthermore, having been planted directly into a tarmac surface, the specimen's condition has been compromised over time.\r- Cherry Laurel (G01) approx. 4.0m high.\r\rRear Garden:\rCrown Reduction and Lifting Proposal (existing trees to be reduced to previous pruning points, approximately 20% crown reduction and canopy lifting to adequately clear street passage):\r- Common Elder (T16) Crown reduction - height reduced to approx.: 3.6-4.0m.\r- Common Hawthorn (T17) Crown reduction - height reduced to approx.: 5.2-6.0m.\r- Common Ash (T18) Crown reduction - height reduced to approx.: 11.2-13.5m.\r- Common Yew (T19) Crown reduction and lift- height reduced to approx.: 6.8-8.0m, crown lift by approx. 0.5m.\r\rBranch removal:\r- Robinia (T12) One lateral stem to be removed.\r- Common Ash (T18) Secondary branch to be removed.\r\rTrees to be removed\r- Common Holly (T13) approx. height: 3.5m.\r",
