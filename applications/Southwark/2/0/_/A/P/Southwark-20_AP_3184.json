To lift the lower branches to clear obstruction to the footpath however the basal sucker growth is to be retained and not removed. To remove the deadwood near the fungal growth.\rT2 - Holly Tree - to cut back low branches over the footpath to give a ground clearance of 2m, to clear obstruction. To cut back in the form of a fan, from ground level up to a height of 2m, to allow the flowerbed to be reinstated. To reduce in height down to approximately 6m ie:  Approximately 50%  ie: the tree has 2 bulbous lumps growing and then a smaller lump - to reduce down to  the height of the smaller lump.\rT3 -Silver Birch Tree - growing around the back near the garages. To remove via natural target pruning, the 2-3 branches which have been unprofessionally pruned and which are suckering up.\rT4 - Yew Tree and Bay Tree - growing in a flowerbed very close to the last garage.  If left to grow to their full potential size, these 2 trees could cause physical damage to the building.  We would recommend felling them and replacing them with shrubs. To fell to as low as possible above existing ground level.\rYew and Bay Stumps -to stump grind the stumps resulting from the above fells to approximately 12\" below ground level\rT5 - Chestnut Tree - growing on the driveway to a small mews. To reduce down to 1m above the previous pollarding points i.e.: a reduction of 4-5m all roundTo report any visual defects seen during the execution of this work\rT6 - Smaller Horse Chestnut Tree - to reduce down to suitable growing points i.e.: approximately 2-3m above the old pollarding points.
