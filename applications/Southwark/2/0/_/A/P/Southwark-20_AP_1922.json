  "description": "Details of Condition 3 - Materials, as required by planning permission 19/AP/1081 (Demolition of existing modern side extension (male WC) on the north elevation and construction of a new extension (1020 x 3400 mm) in stone to match listed building. Insertion of two small windows to the north elevation, where the storeroom is located to change it into a multi-functional room. The windows will match the existing windows in that facade. \rChange the existing toilet into a disabled toilet which will also serve as a male WC. \rMake internal changes to the first floor offices. Remove a wall to make two large offices/meeting rooms. \rEnclose an area to the front side of the church to serve as a multi-functional space and create a mezzanine storage space, reached with new timber stair. \rExtend the mezzanine level at first-floor level by 7710 mm. The mezzanine area facing the church will have sliding glazing to open up or close off the mezzanine level from the rest of the church building. It will provide an additional area of 78sqm. The steel structure supporting the mezzanine will be cladded in matching stone. The structure will not be left exposed, but be sensitively designed to match the existing church's interior.)",
