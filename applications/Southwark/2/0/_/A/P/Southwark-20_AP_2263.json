  "description": "T1 Lime (believed to be part of individual/woodland TPO 216 -tree23). Fell and replace with Field Maple, Acer campestre to the rear of garden. The tree is now of low amenity value as it is no longer in general public view since the building of additional houses since the TPO was made. The lime has been pollarded at a low level and therefore is by no means an exemplary or extraordinary specimen of noteworthy merit. The proximity to the house renders a lot of the garden difficult to use, especially given the sticky honeydew secreted by the associated aphids that plague the tree.",
