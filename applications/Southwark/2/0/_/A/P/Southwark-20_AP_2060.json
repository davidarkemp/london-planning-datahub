  "description": "Six semi-mature Silver Birch trees approximately 7.5m to 9m in height, situated on the bottom\rboundary of the rear garden. The trees are a little dense and wide spreading.\rCrown thin by 20% including the removal of dead wood, lifting low branches, and trimming\rback from the roof of the adjacent building. Two trees in either corner of the rear garden to be removed.\rSouthwark has previously approved removal of five trees - reference 16/AP/1306. At that time we actually only removed two. We now need to remove up to a further two trees, owing to the density of their growth and the overhang onto a neighbouring building. The remaining trees will be thinned as necessary. The trees are not subject to TPOs. The Dulwich Estate has viewed the site and issued a licence (on 1 July 2020) for the work.",
