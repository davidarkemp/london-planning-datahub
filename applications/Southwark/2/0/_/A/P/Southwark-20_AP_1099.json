  "description": "Non-material amendment to planning permission LBS reg no 16/AP/4569 for the demolition of existing buildings and redevelopment to provide two Class B1 office buildings of nine storeys and ten storeys plus plant (41m AOD on Sumner Road and 42.85m AOD on Park Street). The development will include the creation of a new basement; new public realm; provision of a retail (Class A1/A3/A5) kiosk; hard and soft landscaping and other associated works. The amendment would change the description of development to omit references to AOD heights and would read as follows:\r\rDemolition of existing buildings and redevelopment to provide two Class B1 office buildings of nine storeys and ten storeys plus plant.
