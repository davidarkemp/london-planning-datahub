  "description": "T1 - Cypress tree approximately 5.5m in height, situated close to the bottom right- hand corner of the rear garden close to a mature Oak. The tree is badly sited. Remove and the roots grubbed out.\rT2 - Oak tree approximately 15m in height, situated on the bottom boundary of the rear garden. The tree is a little dense. Crown thin by 25% including the removal of dead wood and Ivy, together with necessary re-shaping. The height and basic shape should be retained. It is important to prune branches at convenient growth points, rather than an all- round reduction or pollarding which is not permitted.\rT3 - Cherry tree approximately 9m in height, situated on the bottom boundary to the left-side of the Oak (T2). The tree is a little wide spreading. Three branches overhanging the garden to be removed by severing at the main trunk. No other work is permitted at the present time apart from the removal of dead wood.\rT4 - Ornamental Cypress tree approximately 7.5m in height, situated close to the front right-hand corner of the house. Remove and the roots grubbed out. As a condition of the removal of (T4) above, a replacement tree is to be planted. The agreed species: Italian Cypress tree.\rT5 - Cypress Tree approximately 3m in height, situated close to the bottom left- hand corner of the rear garden. The tree is leaning at an acute angle. Remove and the roots grubbed out.\r\r\r\r\r\r",
