  "description": "Felling of Cypress (Leylandii) trees 15m in height on the right hand side close to the boundary at the bottom of rear garden. the trees are too large for their location and excessively shade the rear of the garden. The trees need removing because affecting the Hawthorn Tree in neighbours garden (no 96) which is subject to a TPO. They are killing the boundary hedge which needs to be maintained in the conservation area. They are killing the adjacent Bramley Apple Tree . They cause excessive dryness in rear half of the garden. As proposed by Tony George from the Dulwich Estate once the trees are felled it is to be replaced with two sweet gum trees (slender silhouette variety) that grow up to 6m tall and 1m wide.",
