  "description": "T1 - Leaning Holm Oak in front boundary of Champion Hill House. Reduce length of all branches by up to 1.8 - 2 metres ensuring natural shape and balance typical of species is maintained where possible.  Remove or cut back low branches to give a 3 metres clearance from ground level. Prune to clear lamp - works to be carried out with a MEWP. Reasons:\r - The tree is located to the front boundary to the right hand side of the Vehicle Entrance point\r - Reduction by 1.8 - 2m is part of a maintenance program to maintain the tree at a suitable size for its location\r - To reduce the crown load due to the extent of the lean\r - To reduce the branch end weight\r - To reduce the encroachment from the grass are and driveway areas \r - To allow more suitable light in to the area and to expose the lamp within the car park area\r",
