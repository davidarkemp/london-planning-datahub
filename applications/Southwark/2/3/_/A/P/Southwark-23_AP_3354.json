  "description": "Non material amendment of planning permission ref. no. 23/AP/1984 dated 28/09/2023 for 'Raising of the existing outrigger roof by approx. 1050mm, to provide additional floorspace on the Second Floor. A new sash window matching the existing windows will replace the small existing window of the outrigger and two rooflights are added to the outrigger roof. The existing dormer on the rear elevation is proposed to be widened by approx. 700mm with two new sash windows to match the existing. The new dormer roof will be finished with roof tiles that will match the existing. The proposed works also include a new conservatory infill extension to the Ground Floor and the Crittall -type glazed conservatory extension will have a matching glazed roof to provide further sunlight into the Ground Floor space. The existing rooflight and double doors to the side of the proposed conservatory will be replaced with a Crittalltype rooflight and double doors, respectively, to match the proposed conservatory'. The amendment seeks the following: \r- The height of the raised roof ridge of the rear outrigger to be reduced to 0.85m above the existing\r- The new sash window to the rear of the two-storey outrigger to be reduced in proportion \r- The two new rear rooflights are to be conservation-type rooflights with a dividing vertical glazing bar\r- The height of the rear dormer is to be reduced to 2.6m from base to the ridge\r- The zinc cladding of the dormer is to be dark grey.",
