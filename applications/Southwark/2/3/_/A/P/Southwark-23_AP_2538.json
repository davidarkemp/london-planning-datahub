  "description": "Works to a TPO tree:\rXL Ash tree in rear garden. Tree branches are touching the building and one branch has rubbed so much on top of the building that it has caused some bricks to become loose above balconies and this needs to be dealt with asap. Remove lateral limbs growing towards the building back to the trunk which are at the same height or lower than the building structure. Ensure there is a 4m clearance of the building for the upper canopy. 5 day notice required as work is urgent as the bricks at the upper level are dangerously loose, where there are balconies below, remedial work can not be carried out until tree work has been completed.",
