  "description": "Works to trees in a conservation area: \rT1 - XL Cherry Plum tree in the front garden adjacent to the pavement. Remove water shoots and lift canopy over pavement to 2.5m.\rT2 - XL Ash tree in rear garden, causing significant shading to neighbours garden and also as it boarders both gardens as it is on the boundary fence between 50 and 51 Grove Park, it is important to maintain the safety of this tree following its previous reduction. Lateral light supressed branches are elongated and need to be pollarded back to original reduction points. Reduce tree by 30% to previous points.\rT3 - XL London Plane tree on left hand side of rear of garden. Tree has significant Ivy growth into crown and also is shading gardens to the rear. Neighbours have requested the tree to be maintained. Pollard to historic points and remove Ivy to crown break, work to be completed in the winter.\rT4 - XL London Plane tree on right hand side of rear of garden. Tree has significant Ivy growth into crown of tree. Neighbours have requested the tree to be maintained. Pollard to historic points and remove Ivy to crown break in the winter.\rT5 - Small Variegated Acer. Planted in middle of rear of garden. Wrong location for a tree in the middle of the rear garden. Section fell to ground level and grub out the stump.\rT6 - Small Apple tree and rose growing again in the middle of the grass area towards the rear of the garden. Section fell to ground level and grub out the stump.\rG1 - Group of 2 Hazel trees on left hand side of garden. Trees have grown out from previous reduction points significantly and are now shading the garden. Reduce to previous points, to 3m to retain screening.",
