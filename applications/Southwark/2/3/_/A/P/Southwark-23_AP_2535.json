  "description": "Works to trees in a conservation area. \rT1.          A Judas tree (Cercis) approximately 9m in height, situated in the front right-hand corner. Lightly thin by approximately 15% including the removal of any dead wood, lifting of low branches and the necessary shaping of the tree, ensuring the height and basic shape is retained.\rT2.         A Holm Oak tree approximately 10m in height, situated in a central location on the front boundary.  Low branches to be lifted or shortened back to convenient growth points.  The crown should be thinned by approximately 20% including the removal of dead wood, and necessary re-shaping ensuring the height and basic shape is retained.\rT3.         A Eucalyptus tree approximately 16m in height, situated close to the house on the left-hand side boundary of the rear garden.  Reduce in height by up to 5m and re-shape as necessary.\r",
