  "description": "Sycamore in rear garden to be felled to ground level and removed.\rReasons: 1. Concerns as very close to the house. 2. Taking all the light from the rear of property and surrounding neighbours gardens. \r3. Consideration to neighbours. 4. There is a much larger mature Sycamore in the middle of the garden which is the dominant specimen, \rwe would simply like to remove the unwanted self seeded younger tree near the house, leaving the main tree as the focal point.\r5. The garden is far to small for any other trees other than the main Sycamore.",
