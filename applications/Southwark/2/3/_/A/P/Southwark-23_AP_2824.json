  "description": "To remove a Poplar tree on the corner of property. The roots of the tree are causing severe damage to the property and neighbours property. The concrete on both properties is extremely uneven caused by the roots of the tree. The tree has grown to such a height that there are concerns of larger branches falling in strong winds. Smaller branches fall on a regular basis which could seriously injure someone either at the property or passerby. An arborist who produced a report about the tree confirmed it was causing damage to both properties. 156 Queens Road recently had a drain survery conducted which showed the roots are under their property and will cause further damage if left. To remove the tree and replace it with a smaller new tree if required.\r",
