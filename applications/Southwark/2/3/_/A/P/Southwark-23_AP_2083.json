  "description": "Variation of Condition 2 'Approved Plans' of planning permission 19/AP/0545: Construction of a side and rear single storey extension\r\rVariations sought: \r- Changing the approved flat roof section showing on approved drawing ref:1807 -15-a to be replaced with gable roof so there is one gable roof to rear instead of a mixture of gable and flat roofs.\r- Maintain the approved ridge height at that point. The approved parapet wall will be reduced in height to what have been approved as a result. \r- Existing bathroom window will be slightly reduced in depth to accommodate the flashing to the wall. Roof light on that side instead of the flat roof light. \r- The small section of the flat roof adjacent to the external dining room wall will be replaced by taking the lean to roof all the way to that wall so in effect the appearance on that particular section will not looked altered when looking from the rear garden, and this will not have any negative impact or adversary on the adjacent property, but there will be a slight increase of the volume as a result as this section. The window of the dining room will not be reduced in height as approved but part will be blocked where the rafters of the lean to roof abut it this will allow keeping the main feature of the window and at the same time allowing visual connection into the proposed extension and the rear of the garden. The opening at the rear wall will be reduced to a set of bifold doors which the overall width is less than the combination of the French doors and large window. Internally the proposed cloak room is omitted in favor of a better kitchen layout.",
