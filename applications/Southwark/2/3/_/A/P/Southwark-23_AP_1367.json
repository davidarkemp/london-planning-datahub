  "description": "Works to trees in a conservation area: T1 Holm Oak (x1) - Fell to ground level. T2 Plum (x1) - Fell to ground level. T4 Cherry (x1) - Fell to ground level. T5&6 Apple (x2) - Fell to ground level. T7 Crab Apple (x1) - Fell to ground level. T9 Laburnum - Fell to ground level. Replacement Planting proposed.\r\rREASON FOR FELLING TREES- T1, T2, T4, T5, T6, T7,T9: They are generally poor specimens in inappropriate locations. Trees to be removed which do not form part of the wider re-landscaping plan. This includes planting multiple new trees. Please see separate document(s) attached. \r\rT8 Plum (x1) - Remove the central small single previously cut stem. Thin remainder of crown by 20% through the removal of watershoots plus a small reduction of 1-2m via 'drop-crotch' method to retain form, cutting back to natural branch unions. Reason: General maintenance. To maintain the tree at a smaller size. Alteration to planning application [22/AP/3827] to change the replacement tree to Magnolia grandiflora 'Ferruginea'. To be placed at a suitable location along the right hand boundary.",
