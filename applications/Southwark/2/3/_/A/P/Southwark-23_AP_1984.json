  "description": "Raising of the existing outrigger roof by approx. 1050mm, to provide additional floorspace on the Second Floor. A new sash window matching the existing windows will replace the small existing window of the outrigger and two rooflights are added to the outrigger roof. The existing dormer on the rear elevation is proposed to be widened by approx. 700mm with two new sash windows to match the existing. The new dormer roof will be finished with roof tiles that will match the existing.\rThe proposed works also include a new conservatory infill extension to the Ground Floor and the Crittall -type glazed conservatory extension will have a matching glazed roof to provide further sunlight into the Ground Floor space. The existing rooflight and double doors to the side of the proposed conservatory will be replaced with a Crittall-type rooflight and double doors, respectively, to match the proposed conservatory.",
