Part of the thin is to remove old growth points to old pollard points which will encourage regeneration in this area next year, with an idea of being able to reduce the canopy to these points in the longer term.\rT2 - Medium Bay tree. Causing excessive shading. Reduce canopy to 3m.\rT3 - Neighbours Sycamore, very rotten at historic pollard points. Dangerous. Section fell to ground level and poison stump.\rT4 - Medium Beech tree, tree is located at no 63 GP. Tree has been previously reduced as it causes excessive shading to gardens. Crown reduce to previous points.",
