G1 - 3 Medium Leylandii trees. Reduce height to level of neighbours gutter and face up front of hedge to reduce as much as possible, also cut back growth from neighbouring property to give 1m clearance. T2 - Remove dead leylandii leaning into neighbours garden to ground level. T3- Neighbours Holm Oak in neighbours garden. Pollard to historic points and remove limb over garden back to trunk. T4 - Holm Oak above bike shelters. Crown reduce by 40% and reshape as required.",
