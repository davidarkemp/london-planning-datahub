  "description": "Non material amendment of planning permission ref. no. 22/AP/1033: Construction of an L-shaped rear dormer with a Juliet balcony and a roof terrace on the rear outrigger, together with the raising of the existing party parapet walls and the installation of one rooflight on the front roof slope. NMA sought: Proposed to remove existing chimney breast - it is of very poor quality upon closer inpection and leaning 250mm, it is unsafe and leaking into the room below. It is worth stipulating that the opposing property has removed both chimney stacks. \r\rIt is proposed to add a matching (to the cladding) zinc planter to replace a previously approved standardised glazed privacy screen.\r\rThe proposal incorporates a new natural perennially planted screen as a privacy screen to the neighbouring property to the south.",
