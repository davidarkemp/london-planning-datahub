The birch has been dead for a very long time and roots are\runstable. Section fell to ground level. A replacement tree will be planted in a convenient location of the rear garden and below are the three alternative species advised by the Dulwich Estate:\rCercis siliquastrum         (Judas tree)\rPaulownia tomentosa    (Foxglove tree)\rAcer davidii                      (Snakebark Maple)\rThe new tree will be planted with a stem girth of between 14-16cm at 1m above ground level and at a minimum height of 2.m.\rT2 - Cherry Plum tree. Thin canopy by 20% and reshape as required.\rG2 - 3 Yew trees. Lift canopies to 2m so they are symmetrical. Reduce longer lateral\rbranches by up to 0.5m to match rest of canopies as part of the reshape so that the 3 yew\rtrees will look as symmetrical as possible.\rT3 - Large Apple tree. Crown reduce by 20% and thin canopy by 20%.",
