A Weeping Willow tree approximately 12m in height situated on the left-hand side boundary midway down the rear garden.  Crown thin by approximately 30% including the removal of dead wood, lifting of low branches, and the necessary shaping of the tree.  The height may also be reduced by up to 25% by removing the vertical growth in the upper crown whilst retaining the natural weeping shape.  It is important to prune branches at convenient growth points where possible.\r\r",
