Trees are too close to property and should be removed to ground level and their stumps poisoned. \rT1 - Large Lime tree on left hand side of rear garden. Stem is growing from historic pollard, which looks healthy, but for safety it is worth reducing by 40% to reduce sail area.\rT2 - Large Lime tree on right hand side of rear garden. Remove dead stem, reduce canopy by 30% and remove epicormic growth.",
