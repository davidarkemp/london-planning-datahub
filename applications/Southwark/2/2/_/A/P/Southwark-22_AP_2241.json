  "description": "Non material amendment to planning permission 18/AP/1604 [dated 29.05.2020] in relation to Development Zones G and P for Hybrid planning permission for the comprehensive redevelopment of land including the Surrey Quays Shopping Centre, Surrey Quays Leisure Park, former Harmsworth Quays Printworks and land at Roberts Close for a range of land uses, new and improved public realm and associated infrastructure works. \rThe amendment seeks the following: \rDevelopment Zone G\rAn update to the Proposed Basement Extents Parameter Plan (in relation to car park vent under sailing connected with Development Zone G);\rAn update to the Proposed Servicing and Access Parameter Plan (in relation to the servicing and access arrangement for Development Zone G);\rAn update to the Proposed Maximum Heights Parameter Plan (in relation to a single lift overrun going above 30m in an isolated location within Development Zone G);\rAn update to Design Guideline MP3.5 (in relation to the Redriff Road building line for Development Zone G)\rAn update to Design Guideline MP6.5 (in relation to the New Brunswick Street facade height for Development Zone G)\rA minor tweak to the facade walls on the north-east and north-west elevations\r\rDevelopment Zone P\rRelocation of the Development Zone P within the Park to bring the Pavilion and Vent Structure closer to Plot G\rThe Development Zone boundary for Development Zone P has also increased in width, length, and area to accommodate a potentially less orthogonal shaped Pavilion structure.\rIt is not proposed to fill to the extents of the revised Development Zone P box. \rFor the avoidance of doubt, the height for Zone P remains unchanged and the Pavilion structure will sit within the original approved extent of 12m AOD.\rAll parameter plans updated to show the relocation of Zone P\r",
