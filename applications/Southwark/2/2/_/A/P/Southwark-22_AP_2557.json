  "description": "Details submitted under partial discharge of condition 10 (Excluded Works) pursuant to hybrid planning permission reference 18/AP/1604 (dated 29 May 2020) for comprehensive redevelopment of the Canada Water Masterplan. This submission relates specifically to the design and construction of modifications required in the existing Surrey Quays Shopping Centre car park and delivering of the Transport for London (TfL) site compound area for the Surrey Quays Station upgrade works. Proposed modification will allow optimisation of existing parking space to facilitate the continuation of construction works in neighbouring areas without disturbance to the shopping centre operational requirement and parking facilities. The TfL site compound works will require the realignment of Deal Porters Way and associated landscape works.",
