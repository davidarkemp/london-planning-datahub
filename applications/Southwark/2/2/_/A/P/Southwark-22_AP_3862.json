Crown lift to 4m above ground level.  Reduction to shape canopy, pruning to suitable points and maintaining natural aesthetic.\rWork undertaken to bring back to form and improve light conditions for both owner and neighboring properties.  Tree has been pruned previously so work is part of an ongoing maintenance cycle.  The pruning will not go beyond any previous points and sufficient time has elapsed to allow canopy regrowth. The tree will tolerate the pruning as specified above.",
