  "description": "Amended Specification, in line with Dulwich Estate Licence\rT1.          Two Yew trees approximately 10-12m in height, situated on the front boundary with Alleyn Park.  The trees are a little sparse.\rT2.          An Ash tree approximately 20m in height, situated in a central location towards the bottom of the rear garden.  The tree is a little dense.\rT3.          A small group of Yew and Cypress bushes approximately 5m in height, situated close to the house on the right-hand side boundary.  The trees are in poor condition.\rDescription of Approved Works\rT1.          Reduce all round by up to 1m in order to encourage new growth and increase the density of the foliage.  The height and basic shape should be retained.\rT2.          Crown thin by 20% including the removal of dead wood and necessary re-shaping.  The height and basic shape should be retained.  It is important to prune branches at convenient growth points, rather than an all-round reduction or pollarding which is not permitted.\rT3.          Remove and the roots grubbed out.\rA replacement hedge should be planted along this section of the boundary, and below are three alternative species for consideration:Taxus baccata                    (Yew)Prunus lusitanica              (Portugal Laurel)Ligustrum vulgare            (Common Privet)",
