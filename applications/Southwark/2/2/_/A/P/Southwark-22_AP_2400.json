  "description": "Works to trees at The Millpond, College Road. T1 - Horse Chestnut (Aesculus hippocastanum) formerly approximately 17m height on the southern bank of the pond. A large branch has collapsed into the pond from the bifurcation of the crown at 4.5m height. The tree has subsequently been pollarded to the same height so that the remaining crown which overhung the A205 has also removed. The fallen stem has notable internal decay which appears to extend well within the branch from below a former pruning wound and into the bole of the tree. Exacerbated by cavities and major wounds elsewhere including directly beneath the fracture and at 2.5 height facing north where other large limbs had been removed. \rThe cause of failure is likely to be due to the susceptibility of the relatively soft wood structure to decay resulting in severely compromised residual wall strength.\rRecommended work: Dismantle the fallen limb as necessary and remove from the pond. Place lengths or stack cut stems on pond edge. Add to the planting schedule to replace with 2 x Swamp cypress (Taxodium distichum) 14-16cm girth in the next available planting season.\r\rT2 - Horse Chestnut (Aesculus hippocastanum) approximately 16m adjacent to T2. Although of a similar age, size and position to T1 it does not display the same extent of previous pruning with no significant wounds within the bole or lower crown, indicating that advanced decay may not be as prevalent a risk factor. However, upper fork unions are close and there is evidence of minor crown dieback. The effects of leaf miner (Cameraria ohridella) are also a contributory factor to overall vitality. Otherwise there are no abnormalities or significant indicators of decay or canker and the buttress shows no sign of fungal fruiting bodies. Recommended works: Lateral reduction of the branch overhanging the  A205 traffic lights by up to 2m to reduce lever arm weight loading. Remove deadwood. Re-inspection schedule: Annually.",
