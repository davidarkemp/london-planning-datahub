Granting permission will limit these costs. In the event of a refusal we, or our clients, will seek to secure compensation for the additional costs incurred through Section 202(e).\rShould the tree/s remain the total cost of repairs will be the Superstructural repairs + Alternative method of repairs = ??65,000.00.\rIt is the expert opinion of both the case engineer and arboriculturalist that on the balance of probabilities the supporting information demonstrates the influence of the tree(s).\rNote: Further monitoring results may be submitted if these become available during the course of this application.",
