  "description": "Variation of Condition 1 (Approved Plans) pursuant to planning permission 21/AP/2528 for Demolition of existing rear two storey outrigger and construction of ground floor side and rear extensions and lower ground floor rear extension  The amendment seeks the following: reduction of scope to the rear ground and first floor extension. The total area reduction in terms of GIA footprint at ground floor level is 13sqm and 3.9sqm at first floor respectively. The depth of the extension has been considerably reduced to 3.6m.\r - Boundary fence/wall with 321 Lordship Lane : The boundary wall/fence due to being in poor condition and at risk of collapsing is to be rebuilt. \r - As a result of the reduction in extension depth the flank wall of the proposed extension is to now be built \rastride to this boundary wall, as shown on the amended architectural plans.\r - First floor, rear elevation : Reduction in depth of the first floor massing, commensurate with the reduction at \rground floor. Omission of the window to the splayed corner. \r - Side extension : Introduction of a rooflight within the flat roof of the side extension in lieu of the exposed \rtimber rafters indicated on the approved scheme.",
