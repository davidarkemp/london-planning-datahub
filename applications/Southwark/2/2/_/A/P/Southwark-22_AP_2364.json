  "description": "T1 Bay Tree - This vigorous shrub is excessively shading the garden and having a detrimental effect on surrounding vegetation. All round\rcrown reduction (see photo 1) leaving no more than 4m in height and 3m in diameter. Retain domed shape to crown where possible. This\rshould be followed by annual pruning to maintain it at a reasonable height for a small garden.\r\rT2 Acacia - There are 2 large branches overhanging the garden which are also contributing to excessive shading (photo 2 and photo 3) and\rhaving a detrimental effect on other planting. These should be removed. Such pruning will make the tree more resistant to extreme weather\revents and could therfore help increase its useful working life.",
