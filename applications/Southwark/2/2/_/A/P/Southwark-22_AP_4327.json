  "description": "T1.          Japanese Maple tree. The tree is dying. Remove and the roots grubbed out.\rT2.          Weeping Birch tree. Crown thin by 15% including the removal of dead wood and necessary re-shaping.  The height and basic shape should be retained.\rT3.          Apricot espalier tree.  The tree is becoming too large for its location against a brick wall. Remove and the roots grubbed out.\rT4-T6.          Three Silver Birch trees. Crown thin by 15% including the removal of dead wood and necessary re-shaping.  The height and basic shape should be retained.  It is important to prune branches at convenient growth points, rather than an all-round reduction or pollarding which is not permitted.\rA replacement tree should be planted a little further to the rear close to the steps and below are the three alternative species for consideration: Rhus typhina (Sumach), Magnolia stellata (Magnolia), Acer griseum (Paperbark Maple). The new tree should be planted during the November 2022 and March 2023 planting season with a stem girth of between 14-16cm at 1m above ground level and at a minimum height of 2.5m.\r",
