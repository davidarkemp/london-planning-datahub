  "description": "3 x Leylandii (G1) - crown reduce\rReduce height by 6m from 16m to 10m.  Reduce lateral spread by 2m from 12m to 10m.  Reduction to lessen canopy, pruning to suitable points and maintaining as natural an aesthetic as possible.\rWork undertaken to  improve light conditions for both owner and neighboring properties.  Furthermore, a leak by a nearby swimming pool has allowed chlorine to permeate the soil and there is some dieback in the crown.  Removal was considered but a heavy reduction will keep green cover, privacy and habitat.\rThe tree will tolerate the pruning as specified above and approval for felling has been granted by Dulwich Estates.",
