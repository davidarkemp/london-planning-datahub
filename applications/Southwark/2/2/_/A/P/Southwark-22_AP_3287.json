Trees to be removed which do not form part of the wider re-landscaping plan. This includes planting multiple new trees. Please see separate document(s) attached. \rT10-13 Limes (x4) - Reduce crowns by approximately 1.5m all around. Reason: General maintenance. To maintain the trees at a smaller size.",
