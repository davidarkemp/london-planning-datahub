  "description": "Construction of installing a different locking system that requires an external handle be installed to the door, to remove the existing timber main entrance door and install a new timber entrance door, to match the existing installation, with the exception of the removal of the brass push plate and installation of a new brass handle as shown. All other existing ironmongery will be reinstated to the new door, with anything not to be reused left on the existing door which is to be retained by CLC and put on display. proposal will seek to increase the security of the door through an added 5mm of thickness, stronger Oak timber and multi point locking mechanisms.",
