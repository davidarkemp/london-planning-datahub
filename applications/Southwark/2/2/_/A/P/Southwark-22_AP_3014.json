The changes include increasing the size of the acoustic enclosure for the air source heat pump and revising the wording of Condition 6 to allow for a representative Background sound level at the nearest noise sensitive premises to be used and the Specific plant sound level to be 5 dB(A) or more below the background sound level in this location, opposed to 10 dB(A) or more.",
