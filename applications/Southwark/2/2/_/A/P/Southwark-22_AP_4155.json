  "description": "Five day notification for following tree works. Reduce/Pollard Robinia pseudoacacia Tree (TPO Number: 516) by 10 meters from 18 meters to 8 meters due to recent branch failure. There is a large stem which has failed and resting on the roof of the property, to make the tree safe the stem has to be reduced to just below the failure point at 8 meters. Following the reduction the tree will be very unbalanced and the second main stem over the road needs to be reduced to the same height to prevent failure from windthrow. All low epicormics is to be retained.",
