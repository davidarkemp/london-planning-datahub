  "description": "2 Apples (T1 & T2) - crown reduce\rReduce height by 1m from 5m to 4m.  Reduce lateral spread by 1m from 4m to 3m.  Reduction to shape canopy, pruning to suitable points and maintaining natural aesthetic.\rWork undertaken to bring back to form and improve light conditions for both owner and neighboring properties.  Tree has been reduced previously so work is part of an ongoing maintenance cycle.  The pruning will not go beyond any previous points and sufficient time has elapsed to allow canopy regrowth. The tree will tolerate the pruning as specified above.\r\rApple (T3) - fell, height of 4m.\rTree is showing signs of dieback in the canopy and has a large cavity in the main stem with less than 20% holding wood remaining.  It is not a good specimen and it is felt that although a crown reduction will help keep green cover it will not be a good long term solution.  \rWork undertaken to prevent any health & safety issues in the future.  A native species will be planted as a replacement.\r\rWillow (T4) - crown reduce\rReduce height by 4m from 9m to 5m.  Reduce lateral spread by 4m from 9m to 5m.  Reduction to shape canopy, pruning to suitable points and maintaining natural aesthetic.\rWork undertaken to bring back to form and improve light conditions for both owner and neighboring properties.  Tree is a lapsed pollard so work is part of an ongoing maintenance cycle.  The pruning will not go beyond any previous points and sufficient time has elapsed to allow canopy regrowth. The tree will tolerate the pruning as specified above.",
