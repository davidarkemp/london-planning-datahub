The proposed amendment is to allow the space to also be used for Class D1 purposes (non-residential institutional uses) by amending the description of development to become 'Change of use of part of the ground and first floors of the Energy Centre from Class A1-A4 (retail) to flexible Class A1-A4 (retail)/Sui Generis/Class D1 (non-residential institution use) for use as an Estates Hub (for estate management, welfare facilities, community meeting space and cafe and by a community interest company to provide support, community workshops and events, and support for social enterprises)'.",
