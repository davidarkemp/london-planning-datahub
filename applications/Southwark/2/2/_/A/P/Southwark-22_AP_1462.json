  "description": "REVISED SPECIFICATION:\rT1 - Large Oak tree, the canopy is very lopsided due to the historic proximity of adjacent trees, for the longer-term health of the tree and stability it would be good practice to reduce the crown to form a more compact specimen, crown reduce by 20% and weight reduce elongated limb by 3m. \rT2 - Lime tree opposite seating area and patio, tree is causing significant shading near patio, one of 4 lime trees, this tree is the only one to have not been maintained in line with the other 3. Pollard to height of G1. \rG1 - 3 Lime trees on boundary, routine maintenance, pollard to previous points. \rT3 - Remove camellia to ground level and grub out stump. \rT4 - Strawberry tree nearest drive and under Holly tree canopy. Remove to ground level and grub out stump which will give more space to appreciate the Holly and Cypress.  \rT5 - Strawberry tree on RHS of garden, routine maintenance, crown reduce top of the canopy by 2m and reshape as required.",
