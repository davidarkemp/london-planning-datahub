  "description": "Non material amendment of planning permission ref. no. 19/AP/5757 dated 27/12/2019 - To the coping stone detail on the front (Shad Thames elevation) and rear (River Thames elevation), fit a zinc capping detail to match the roof and keep the building water tight.\rTo penthouse 19, there are external blinds that sit above the single pitched glazing. These blinds no longer work and have been discontinued. It is proposed to remove them and supply and fit solar reflective film to the glazing. By adding the zinc capping detail to the coping stone detail it will assist in keeping the building water tight and be in keeping with the new roof.\rBy removing the external blinds to the windows of penthouse 19 and fitting solar reflective film, it will remove any future maintenance requirements, as access is not possible.",
