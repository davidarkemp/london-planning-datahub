One large limb has snapped and is hanging from the canopy.  Crown lift canopy to 5m above ground level by removing 4 lowest limbs and snapped limb, pruning to suitable points and maintaining natural aesthetic. Work undertaken to bring back to form, improve light conditions for both owner and neighboring properties and prevent any health and safety issues in future.",
