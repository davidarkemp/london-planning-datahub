  "description": "Non material amendment to planning permission ref. 22/AP/0045 dated 14/03/2022 for Details of Condition 3 (Sample materials/panels/boards) as required by planning permission dated 04/06/2021 [LBS Ref 21/AP/1237] for 'Reconfiguration of the existing mixed-use ground and first-floor levels retaining their current use, and addition of two new residential flats (2 x 2 bed 3 person) within a two storey extension to create second and third floor levels including rear balconies, and alterations to the front and rear elevations'.  The amendment seeks the following: The red brick to the existing street elevation should be maintained, or preferably a higher quality red brick (such as that evident at 215 Rye Lane) should be applied to the entirety of this elevation instead. The upwards extension which will be set back from the street elevation can be of a yellow brick, which would match the materials arrangements at 213 Rye Lane(Lobo House) which has red brick to the street elevation and yellow brick to the setback upwards extension. A yellow London stock brick should be used instead of the golden buff brick currently proposed. A render finish to the side elevations",
