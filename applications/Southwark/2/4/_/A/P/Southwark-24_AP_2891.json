  "description": "Amended specification agreed by email 14.11.2024.\rT2 Sycamore - fell and treat stump with eco-plugs. T3 Sycamore - 30% reduction. The closer of the two trees is within influencing distance of the property, For T3, in seeking to balance the requirements of BS:3998 and undertaking sufficient pruning to reduce water uptake, it should be noted that Crown Reduction in the order of 30% to 50% equates to a reduction in crown volume of 70% to\r90% thereby complying with BRE IP7/06. The supplementary report to Hortlink 212 published in 2014 confirms that these reduction percentages in crown volume are effective in reducing water uptake.\r\r\r",
