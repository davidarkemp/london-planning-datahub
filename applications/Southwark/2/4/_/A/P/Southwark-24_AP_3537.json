  "description": "Non-material amendment to planning permission ref: 23/AP/3279 dated 13/11/2024 for 'Proposed demolition and replacement of existing pier (including new pontoon, canting brow and piles), alongside refurbishment of existing landside peninsula and installation of proposed lightweight over dock walkway, to facilitate a new fully accessible electric cross-river ferry service from Rotherhithe Pier to Canary Wharf Pier'. The amendments include the following: \r\r - slight increase in the footprint of the consented pontoon from 36m x 16m to 36m x 19m pushing slightly out both towards the main river channel and landslide. This change has been made following design progression of the auto-mooring system and subsequent requirement for more space on the pontoon.\r\r - slight decrease in the Brow length from 62m to 60m and thus slightly steeper gradient at low water to accommodate the above increase in pontoon footprint, with limited incursion towards the main river navigation channel.\r\r - addition of lighting on the over dock walkway which will be subject to the same light restrictions as the brow and fixed bridge for safety purposes.",
