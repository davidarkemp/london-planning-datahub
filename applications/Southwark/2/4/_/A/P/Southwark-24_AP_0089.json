  "description": "Variation of conditon 1 planning 23/AP/0405 dated 28/03/2023 for A) Install new flat roof access hatch with scissor stairs to flat new build roof, incorporating guard rails and davit arm; B) Install fall arrest system over the pitched roof system to incorporate low visibility ladder hooks, removable ladders and a line system over the ridge to the inside face of the front elevation parapet; C) Install new attic access with scissor stairs within BMH pitched roof and board out attic space with tongue and groove plywood. The variations proposed are: A) Omit the new access hatch on the flat roof, and instead increase the size of the existing hatch and install guard rail in this location; B)\tFixed internal access ladder or demountable ladder to the enlarged access hatch; C) Reconfigure the fall arrest / lifeline system so that the horizontal line is at the rear of the building with a long line to allow operatives to use ladders to access the front of the building, and a shorter attachment for the rear of the building and associated works. \r\r",
