  "description": "Amended Specification to match DE Licence\rWorks to Trees in a Conservation Area: \rT1.         A Weeping Willow tree approximately 18m in height, situated close to the bottom boundary of the rear garden.  The tree is a little tall and dense. Crown thin by approximately 30% including the removal of dead wood, lifting of low branches, and the necessary shaping of the tree.  The height may be reduced by up to 25% by removing the vertical growth in the upper crown whilst retaining the natural weeping shape.  It is important to prune branches at convenient growth points where possible.\rT2.         A twin- stemmed Silver Birch tree approximately 16m in height, situated on the right-hand side boundary towards the bottom of the garden.  The tree is a little tall. The left-hand stem is reduced in height to correspond with the right-hand stem.  It is important to prune the stem at a convenient growth point.\rT3.         An Oak tree approximately 10m in height, situated close to the house on the left-hand side boundary. Lightly thin by 15% including the removal of dead wood and snag end branches, and necessary re-shaping.  The height and basic shape should be retained.  It is important to prune branches at convenient growth points\r",
