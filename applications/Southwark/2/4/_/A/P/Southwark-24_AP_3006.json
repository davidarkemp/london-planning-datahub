  "description": "Tree Plotter 1774 - a good quality London Plane approximately 30m of high amenity value on the boundary of no. 57. It is likely to be the same age as adjacent Grade II listed properties. The crown overhangs the garden and has a symmetrical growth form. Extensive reduction would unbalance the crown and is not merited should minor nuisance due to lower branches be abated via pruning. Recommended works: crown lift to 6m and lateral reduction to previous reduction points. Remove deadwood.\rTree plotter 1754 - a Cotoneaster 4m height on the boundary with no 57 in fair condition but of minor significance to amenity. It has a typical decurrent growth form with minor deadwood. Recommended works: remove deadwood back to live material throughout the crown and reduce by up to lm form the boundary to retain a natural crown form.\rTreePlotter 1757 - a Lawson Cypress 15m height in good condition and screening value to the rear of the garage at no. 57. Should removal be required due to damage full details of level monitoring and positive root identification are required. Recommended works: Lateral reduction to provide up to 1.5m clearance to the garage.\r\r\r\r\r\r\r",
