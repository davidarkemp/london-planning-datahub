To reduce leaf area/ canopy volume by 70-90% to accord with Hortlink 212 advice. All works to accord with BS3998 where possible.\rThe reasons for the application are (and must be verbatim) as follows:\r-The property has been subject to a form of cracking indicative of downward movement of foundations. \r-Engineers are of the opinion movement of the building is consistent with that induced by tree induced moisture abstraction of an underlying clay soil.\r-Roots from Oak, likely T4 have been recovered from below foundation level.\r-Level monitoring has confirmed seasonal movement. \r-In the event of a refusal we are advised the property will be further underpinned.",
