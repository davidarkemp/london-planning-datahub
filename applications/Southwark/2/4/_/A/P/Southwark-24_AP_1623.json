  "description": "T1 Alder tree: To fell. The tree has outgrown its current location and has not yet reached full maturity. It offers little to no amenity value in its present position. The tree is situated on raised ground with a severely restricted root area, which is adjacent to the foundations of a retaining wall. This positioning not only limits the trees growth and health but also poses a significant risk to the structural integrity of the wall, thereby reducing the safe life expectancy of the tree. Furthermore, the tree is disproportionately large for the garden and is blocking a substantial amount of natural light. \r",
