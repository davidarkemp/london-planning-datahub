  "description": "5 Day Notification: H1 - Dying cypress hedge, comprising 3 trees, approximately 2.6m in height, situated to the rear garden boundary with 2 Dovercourt Road. Fell H1 to the ground, as per licence/approval issued by the Dulwich Estate on 05.04.2024. The trees are diseased and dying, with cracked bark, oozing sap and twig and needle dieback, and have been inspected by the Dulwich Estate. Replace with trellis structure and flowering evergreen climbers, to protect privacy (19 Townley Road is substantially overlooked by 2 Dovercourt Road and the rest of Dovercourt Road if not screened) and to give biodiversity and a source for pollinators.\r",
