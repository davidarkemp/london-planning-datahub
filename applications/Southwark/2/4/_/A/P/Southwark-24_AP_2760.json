  "description": "AMENDED SPECIFICATION TO DE LICENCE (S)\rT1.         A Weeping Pear tree approximately 4m in height, situated in the right-hand corner of the front garden.      Trim all over to improve the shape.\rT2.         A Willow tree approximately 8m in height, situated halfway down the left-hand side of the rear garden.  Trim longer growths by up to 60cm back to suitable side growths to improve shape. The height and basic shape to be retained.\rT3.         A Prunus serrula approximately 7m in height, situated adjacent to (T2) above. Lightly trim all over by up to 30cm to improve shape.\rT4.         A Mimosa tree approximately 7m in height, situated in the bottom left-hand corner of the rear garden. A reduction of height by approximately 2.5m back to suitable growth points will control excessive growth and help balance the tree giving more light to the magnolia below.\rT5.         A Robinia tree approximately 12m in height, situated on the right hand side of the rear garden.  Trim the longer growth in the upper crown by up to 1.5m and prune the longer growths overhanging the neighbour at no. 146 by up to 2m including growths impacting the weeping pear below to help re-balance the crown. All pruning points should be to back to suitable side growths.\rT6  A small Paperbark Maple tree (Acer griseum) approximately 5m in height, situated midway down the left-hand side boundary. Lightly thin by up to 15% including the removal of dead wood and necessary re-shaping.  The height and basic shape should be retained.\rT7.   A Twisted Willow tree approximately 6m in height, situated a little closer to the house than (T6).  Reduce all round to previous pruning points and lightly thin by up to 15% including the removal of dead wood and necessary re-shaping.\r",
