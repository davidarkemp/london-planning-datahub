  "description": "Non-material amendments of planning permission ref. 18/AP/3229 granted on for: (Redevelopment of the site involving the construction of a 6-storey plus basement building, comprising a retail art gallery (Class A1) on the ground floor and 3 x 2 bed; 2 x 3 bed and 2 x 4 bed residential units on the upper floors) to carry out the following: \r \r-Change the description of the consented scheme  in terms of provision of dwelling mix (i.e. 3x2B, 2x3B and 2x4B to 5x2B and 2x3B). \r-Change the approved four-bedroom units to  three-bedroom apartments and change the approved three-bedroom units to  two-bedroom apartments. \r-Provide a further ensuite for the third bedroom (on the western façade) of the third-floor apartment through extension westwards which would result in a reduction in the western part of the adjoining terrace.\r-Altering the building line to the south elevation at 3rd, 4th, and 5th floors to make the external amenity space wider and more useable.\r\rExternal Amendments\r-The omission of a window on each floor of the northern façade due to the reduction in bedroom numbers.\r-The resulting windows to move to the centre line of the overall facade. \r-The windows of the southern facade are slightly altered in location to make for best use of the enlarged amenity space.\r\rTechnical Updates\r-Minor changes to be made to provide suitable smoke extract from the basement and internal ventilation separate from the opening windows, due to the external acoustic conditions (including the neighbouring pub). The result is the addition of small intakes and extract points for air to the building facade.\r-Creation of an access hatch as opposed to a staircase access for servicing the air source heat pumps and PVs on the roof. This would reduce the roof level plant configuration to effectively lower the built form of the roof, and significantly reduce the massing to the roof when compared to the approved scheme.\r",
