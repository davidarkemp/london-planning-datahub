Reduction to shape canopy, pruning to suitable points and maintaining natural aesthetic.\rWork undertaken to bring back to form and improve light conditions for neighboring properties. The canopy overhangs the roof and the pruning will bring it back beyond the roofline to mitigate the effects of shade and leaf litter. The tree will tolerate the pruning as outlined above.",
