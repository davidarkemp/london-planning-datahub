  "description": "Non-Material Amendment for planning application 22/AP/1422 dated 12/04/2023 for demolition of the existing house at No.9a Blenheim Grove and the construction of a new part single part two storey 2-bedroom dwelling with a basement, housing a home studio.\rThe proposed amendments to the consented scheme involve:\r\r1. Nominal reduction in size and location of skylight facing west on main roof. \r\r2. Increase in size of conservation skylight facing east on main roof - to provide better daylight quality to the upper floor. \r\r3. Revised material to the single-storey roofs around the rear courtyard, from terrazzo tiles to copper, and nominal reduction to levels around skylight framing. The copper finish is proposed to be pre-patinated to complement and enhance the character of the conservation area.\r\r4. Nominal adjustments to the glazing configuration around the courtyard area - to improve daylight quality.\r\r5. Revised first floor (south facing) windows to rear flank wall from two-pane portrait windows to sash windows and minor adjustments to window sizes and sill level. The amendment to the three windows will be more consistent with the existing windows of the property and improve daylight quality.  \r\r6. Nominal reduction of the sill level of the rear windows on the flat roof first floor extension. This will enhance transparency and improve the daylight quality of the upper floor.",
