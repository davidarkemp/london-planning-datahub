This application represents a departure from strategic policy 10 'Jobs and Businesses' of the Core Strategy (2011) and Saved Policy 1.2 'Strategic and Local Preferred Industrial Locations' of the Southwark Plan (2007) by virtue of proposing to introduce residential accommodation in a preferred industrial location\". \r\rThe amendment seeks to include bulkheads, to conceal services, underneath the soffit of the ground floor storey.",
