Crown reduce canopy by 30% and crown thin by 30%. \rT4 - Medium Acer Negundo. The canopies of the adjacent Acer and apple trees are beginning to touch and cause excessive shading to the garden. Crown reduce canopy by 30% and crown thin canopy by 20%.\rT5- X Large Cherry tree covered in Ivy at the rear of neighbour?s garden, the canopy of which is growing over into clients garden. The canopy is also very thin with a dead stem growing towards the house. Remove Ivy from tree and pollard the tree to 3m to encourage new growth lower to the ground to help it regenerate at a lower level and form a dense crown in the future. \rT6 - Fremontodendron Californicum ?California Glory? tree from neighbours? garden, reduce canopy on client?s side.",
