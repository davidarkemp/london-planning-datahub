Engineers are of the opinion movement of the building is consistent with that induced by tree induced moisture abstraction of an underlying clay soil. Roots from Oak, likely T4 have been recovered from below foundation level. Level monitoring has confirmed seasonal movement. Only complete removal of the tree has the ensured capacity to remove its ongoing influence on the property (and unmask any additional vegetation influence).",
