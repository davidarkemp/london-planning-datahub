  "description": "Works to a Tree in a conservation area:\rT1 - PRUNUS PISSARDII - growing in the front garden.\rThis tree is leaning heavily towards the neighbour's front garden and car parking area. The ground at the base of the trunk shows clear visible signs of heave.\rDue to its age, the tree is dying back and there is visible deadwood throughout the crown possibly as a result of the stress caused by the acute angle to which it is now growing.\rOn Grounds of Health and Safety due to its leaning angle and position near to the public footpath, we would recommend the following:-\rTo fell to as low as possible above existing ground level.\rTo chip the brushwood and clear all resulting chippings created from this work.\rTo leave the trunking neatly on site in the front garden for use by the Gardener/Landscaper\rTo plant a replacement within the first available season October - March. To irrigate the tree to ensure successful establishment.\rMaidenhair tree - Ginkgo Biloba\rLondon Plane - Platanus x Hispanica\rSweet Gum - Liquidambar Styraciflua",
