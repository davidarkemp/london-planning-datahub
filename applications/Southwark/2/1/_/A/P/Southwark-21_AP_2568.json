  "description": "Tree works - 9m large twin false acacia lhs of garden near perimeter wall - crown lift and deadwood as required. \r14 small false acacias (a couple close to the boundary with the neighbours) - dismantle to just above the ground level and attempt to dig out the roots as these trees will be too small to grind out.  \rTwin stem false acacia to be retained in centre of the garden in a raised bed.  Crown lift as required retaining overall height and form.  \rSix medium-sized false acacias about 15cm in diameter towards the back of the property almost at the back wall.  Dismantle to just above ground level.  \r6m false acacia in rhs raised border 30cm in diameter.  Dismantle to just above ground level.  \r7m false acacia 35cm in diameter just in front of the sycamore in rhs boundary.  Dismantle to just above ground level.  \r14m silver birch.  Lateral crown redution away from adajcent property retaining overall height and form. Crown lift as required.  \rThin out and tidy up all the fruit trees (this can take place now to avoid silver leafe disease) remove dead, diseased, broken and crossing branches.   \r7.5m large hazel stand on lhs up against the boundary wall.  Reduce to 3.5m.  \rSmall old cherry (not getting much light) back lhs of the garden.  Tidy up by taking out old dead wood. \rLarge sycamore in far rhs corner behind mahonia japonica.  Repollard (previously pollarded at 4m).\r9m cherry on lhs of the silver birth (in lhs border).  Reduce top by 1.m and shape and crown thin by 25%.  \rLarge spreading cotoneaster.  Tidy up by reducing branch length by 1m to bring it back to the border.\rConifer on lhs. Prune by 1m all-round.\rMature wild cherry close to back of house. Thin out and remove all dead, diseased and crossing branches.",
