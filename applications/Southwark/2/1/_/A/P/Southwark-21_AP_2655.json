The proposals involve the demolition of all buildings and structures and the comprehensive redevelopment of the site to provide three Development Plots (A1, A2 and B) which will contain three Buildings (A1, A2 and B) above ground with basements.  The proposed land uses are: offices (Class E), retail/professional services/food and drink (E), learning and non-residential institutions/local community (F1/F2), medical or health (E) and indoor sport, recreation or fitness (E). - Works of hard and soft landscaping are proposed to create a series of new and improved public realm spaces within the site. This will include the replacement of some trees and the planting of additional new trees. - New vehicular access points are proposed to be created from Surrey Quays Road and Canada Street, along with other incidental works.\r\r",
