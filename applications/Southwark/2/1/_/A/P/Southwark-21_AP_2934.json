  "description": "Details of Condition 4 - Arboricultural Method Statement for planning permission 21/AP/0471 Conversion of garage and extension of its existing footprint to the front of the property, construction of a walkway to join the extended garage to main house, creating an internal courtyard of the outdoor space, demolition of existing lean-to and construction of single storey rear extension and creation of a balcony at second floor level.\r  We arranged a visit by an accredited arboricultural consultant who has prepared an Arboricultural Method Statement. In doing his report, it was found that the large False acacia in the garden is dying and is likely to cause problems in the near future. HIs suggestion is that it be removed and it would make sense to do this before building works commenced.",
