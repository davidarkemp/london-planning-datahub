The phase 1 site investigation (desk study, site categorisation; sampling strategy etc.) shall be submitted to the Local Planning Authority for approval before the commencement of any intrusive investigations. The subsequent Phase 2 site investigation and risk assessment shall be conducted in accordance with any approved scheme and submitted to the Local Planning Authority for approval prior to the commencement of any remediation that might be required.\rb) In the event that contamination is present, a detailed remediation strategy to bring the site to a condition suitable for the intended use by removing unacceptable risks to human health, buildings and other property and the natural and historical environment shall be prepared and submitted to the Local Planning Authority for approval in writing. The scheme shall ensure that the site would not qualify as contaminated land under Part 2A of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 in relation to the intended use of the land after remediation. The approved remediation scheme (if one is required) shall be carried out in accordance with its terms prior to the commencement of development other than that required to carry out remediation, unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority. The Local Planning Authority shall be given two weeks written notification of commencement of the remediation scheme works.\rc) Following the completion of the measures identified in the approved remediation strategy, a verification report providing evidence that all work required by the remediation strategy has been completed shall be submitted to and approved in writing",
