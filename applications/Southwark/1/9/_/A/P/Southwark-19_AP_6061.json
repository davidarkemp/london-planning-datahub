  "description": "T1 - Multi-stemmed LIME tree approximately 16.00m in height is situated on the front boundary with Dulwich Common immediately on the left of the entrance, it appears to be in good health and condition with a high amenity value.  Remove all basal growth.\r\rT2 - Small OAK tree some 1.20m in height is situated in the open space adjacent to Dulwich Common and on the boundary with No.1, this tree will in time become a nuisance and it was therefore agreed that it should be removed.\r\rT3 - 2 x HAWTHORN trees approximately 6.00m in height are situated in the open space adjacent to Dulwich Common and on the rear boundary with No.1, both trees are in good health and condition with medium amenity value, although a little tall.\rI would suggest the trees are reduced in height by 50% and re-shaped as necessary.\r\rT4 - A dead SHRUB situated on the right-hand side boundary of the access road and opposite the garage of No.4 should be removed.\r\rT5 - A line of THUYA trees all in the region of 7.50m in height are situated along the bottom boundary with 8 Frank Dixon Way, all of the trees appear to be in good health and condition with a high amenity value, although a little overgrown and leaning into the road. I would suggest the trees are cut back on the leaning side facing Ryecotes Mead by as much as possible without exposing the inner dead wood, the height should also be reduced to 6.00m from ground level.",
