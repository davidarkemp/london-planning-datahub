  "description": "Statement of Reasons for Tree Preservation Order Application  to Fell and Treat TG1 Ash, TG2 Ash and to remove thorns from TG3 located at 58 Shakespeare Road, London, NW7 4BH  \r\rThe  above  tree  works  are  proposed  as  a  remedy  to  the  differential  foundation movement at the insured property and to ensure the long-term stability of the building.\r\rThe above tree works are proposed to limit the extent and need for expensive and disruptive  engineering  repair  works  at  the  insured  property.  In  this  instance  the estimated repair costs are likely to vary between ?7,000 and ?150,000, depending upon whether the tree/s can be removed or must remain.  \r\rThe  above  tree  works  are  proposed  to  limit  the  duration  of  any  claim  period  and therefore allow the landowner their right to the peaceful enjoyment of their property.\r\rIt is the case that an alternative to felling such as pruning or significant 'pollarding' of the tree would not provide a reliable or sustainable remedy to the subsidence in this case. We do not consider that any other potential means of mitigation, including root barriers, would be effective or appropriate in the circumstances.\rWe are satisfied that the evidence obtained following completion of our Arboricultural Implication Assessment report completed 4TH October 2019, clearly links the TG1, TG2 and TG3 as the cause of damage to the risk address.\rInsurers  understanding  the  requirement  to  offer  replacement  planting  in  the  event\rconsent to fell is granted",
