  "description": "1 x Field Maple (applicants ref. T1) - Approximately 10.00m: Remove dead wood and stub ended branches. Raise crown over access drive to No.77 by approximately 2.25m to allow vehicle access and prevent potential damage by high vehicles. Reduce lateral and sub lateral branches overhanging drive by up to approximately 1.75m-2.00m whilst preserving a naturally flowing crown line and suitable growth points. Reduce overlong extraneous branches throughout the remaining crown back into main crown structure approximately 1.25m to help balance and maintain a natural crown form. Thin crown density by 15%. Raise crown over lawn by 1.00m. Prune back to clear telephone lines by approximately 0.30m-0.50m. General maintenance/ Control encroachment. Standing in Area A14 of Tree Preservation Order.",
