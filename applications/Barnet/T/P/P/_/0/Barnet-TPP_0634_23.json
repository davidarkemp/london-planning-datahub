  "description": "Oak (T1) - Reduce lateral branches over the driveway on south west side by up to 2.5m to get clearance from the phone line, reduce debris fall onto cars and allow shrubs and grass to grow beneath the tree, ensuring a natural canopy outline. Reduce branches growing into the yew tree by 2m to get 1m clearance from the yew tree. Reduce longest section of branches over the road by 2.5m to reduce end loading and bring it back in line with the shape of the tree, ensuring a natural canopy outline. Raise crown to 3m over the pavement and 5m over the road, max branch diameter to cut will be 7cm. This pruning work will not negatively affect the visual amenity of the tree, it will improve the shape, allow statutory clearance below the tree, and allow the other trees/plants in the area to thrive. Standing in T102 of Tree preservation Order.\r\rYew (T2) - Reduce branches touching the garage by 1.5m, to get .5m clearance from the garage. Currently the branches are rubbing on the roof and wall of the garage. Pruning will improve the shape of the tree and stop damage to roof. Standing in Group G65 of Tree Preservation Order.\r",
