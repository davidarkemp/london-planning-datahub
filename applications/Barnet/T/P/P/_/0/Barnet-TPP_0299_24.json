The tree is in a state of decline/sparsely foliated. Several fruiting bodies are present and basal decay suspected. The tree has longitudinal decay pocket extending from ground level into the main crown break. Advanced decay has caused several major limb breakouts. Upper crown structure beyond main crown break is not structurally sound. Standing in Group G4 of Tree Preservation Order.",
