  "description": "2 x Birch - Cut back to boundary line. Standing in T9 and T12 of Tree Preservation Order.\r\rThere are 2 trees which are very overgrown and need cutting back.  One of the trees is at the front of the property to the right of the property (if standing facing 83 Station Road) and in close proximity to the border of our neighbour at 85 Station Road.  The other tree is at the back of the garden and once again its very tall and hanging over the neighbour's garden (85 Station Road). These trees are particularly causing issues when they blossom with the debris being blown into the neighbours garden and I've had numerous complaints from the neighbour pleading with me to cut back the trees.\rPlease see photos attached.",
