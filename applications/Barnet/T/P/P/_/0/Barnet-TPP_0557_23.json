Standing in T11 of Tree Preservation Order.\r\r1 x Ash (applicants ref. T3) - Reduce entire crown back to previous pruning points (approximately 4m). This is to prevent future failure of branches due to tree being located in a high footfall area. Standing in T9 of Tree Preservation Order.\r\r1 x Robina (applicants ref. T4) - Reduce entire crown back to previous pruning points (approximately 2m). This is to prevent future failure of branches due to tree being located in a high footfall area. Standing in T10 of Tree Preservation Order.\r\r1 x Robina (applicants ref. T5) - Reduce entire crown back to previous pruning points (approximately 5m). This is to prevent future failure of branches due to tree being located in a high footfall area. Standing in T13 of Tree Preservation Order.\r\r1 x Ash (applicants ref.
