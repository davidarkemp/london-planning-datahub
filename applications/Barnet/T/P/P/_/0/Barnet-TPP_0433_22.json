  "description": " 1 x Grey Poplar (applicants ref. T402) - Removal of main NE branch back to trunk, due to 2.5m lateral crack along branch, dangerous condition above footpath.\r1 x Norway Maple (applicants ref. T585) - 3m crown reduction all directions (both dead and live branches) and shorten stub of recently dropped 20mm diameter x 6m limb, to reduce likelihood of injury to the public and staff. The tree is at the main entrance to the gardens and overhangs the popular Spike Milligan memorial bench.\r1 x Horse Chestnut (applicants ref. T609b) - Crown reduction, E side, to form 2m clearance between branches and mansion roof and gutters. The quantity of leaves and conkers dropped by the tree blocks gutters and causes damp problems in the building. The tree has been previously pollarded at c.7m.",
