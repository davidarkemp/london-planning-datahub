  "description": "Oak (applicants ref. T1) - Reduce branches overhanging the garden of 5 Amberden Avenue by 2m, leaving a natural canopy outline. Final cuts not to exceed 70mm. The tree overhangs 11m into a 19m garden and completely dominates the garden. The tree is very one sided, with 80% of the canopy over the boundary line. Pruning will allow the garden to be used to it's full extent and let more light into the garden. The tree has never been maintained on the garden side.
