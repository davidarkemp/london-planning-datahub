Remove major dead wood to make safe as large limbs have previously shed(especially in the resent high winds we have had). Reduce a very large limb which forks overhanging the neighbouring garden at No. 14 by 2-3m while leaving as much natural shape as possible and reducing the sail. This will not unbalance the tree.
