  "description": "8 x Oak - Reduce height and spread by 1-1.5m to access more light into gardens and for general tree maintenance as it seems they have not been cut for many years. Remove major dead wood to make safe as large limbs have previously shed(especially in the resent high winds we have had) Recent storms have encouraged us to take action and manage the size of the Oak trees as they grow very tall due to being planted within a tight proximity. Standing in Group G16 of Tree Preservation Order.\r\r1 x Oak - Reduce height and spread by 4-5m while leaving as much natural shape as possible and reducing the sail. This will not unbalance the tree as you will see by my pictures attached there is a excessive amount over overhang. Standing in Group G16 of Tree Preservation Order.",
