  "description": "1 x Oak (applicants ref. T1) - Approximately 19.00m.  This tree has suffered catastrophic failure of its main central stem.  The stem split longitudinally at approximately 8.00m above ground level.  The rear section of the main stem was totally detached and partially hung in the main fork.  Several other lesser branches and limbs were broken, detached or hung in the main crown.  The top upper section of the damaged crown grounded within a neighbouring property, causing significant damage.\r\rHarrisons Tree Service attended the site on Monday 12th September 2022 and removed the dangerously hung limbs. \r\rWorks carried out have been to remove current and immediate danger/hazard.\r\r(RETROSPECTIVE)",
