  "description": "1 x Mature Yew (applicants ref. T1) - Approximately 4.50m. Reduce height by up to 70cm. Reduce lateral and sub lateral growth all round No.35-No.37 by up to approximately 0.50m-0.07m to tidy and control encroachment.\r\r1 x Mature Twin Stemmed Plum (applicants ref. T2) - Approximately 6.00m-7.00m. Reduce crown by up to 1.20m-1.50m all round. Remove ivy from central crown. Thin crown density by approximately 20%. Prune or remove large leaning stem as required.\r\rMixed Species Beech and Holly Hedge (applicants ref. G1) - Approximately 4.00m-5.00m. Reduce hedge height by approximately 1.50m-2.00m as is practicable whilst preserving viable fine branch structure to ensure balanced regeneration and increasing density within the lower hedge sections.\r\r1 x Hawthorn (applicants ref. T3) - Approximately 4.00m-5.00m. Reduce crown by approximately 1.20m. Thin crown density by 20%.\r\r2 x Box Elder (applicants ref. T4, T5) - Approximately 9.00m. Remove dead wood from both trees. Reduce over extended branches by up to approximately 1.20m back into the main crown structure to preserve a compact but natural crown shape. Lightly thin crown density by 15%.",
