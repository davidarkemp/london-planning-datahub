  "description": "1 x Magnolia (applicants ref. T1) - Reduce the density, of the mature deciduous Magnolia tree situated on the left hand side of the front garden by crown thinning approximately 20% including the removal of dead wood, lifting of low branches, and the necessary trimming back from the house, ensuring the height and basic shape is retained. It is important to prune branches at convenient growth points, rather than an all round reduction or pollarding which is not permitted. \r\r1 x Cherry Tree (applicants ref. T2) - Lightly thin a small Cherry tree situated on the right hand side boundary by approximately 15% including the removal of dead wood, lifting of low branches, and the necessary trimming back from the hedge, ensuring the basic shape is retained. It is important to prune branches at convenient growth points where possible. \r\r1 x Willow Tree (applicants ref. T3) - Reduce the density of the mature Weeping Willow tree situated close to the bottom left hand corner of the garden by crown thinning approximately 40% including the removal of dead wood, lifting of low branches, and the necessary shaping of the tree. The height may be reduced by removing the vertical growth in the upper crown by some 25% whilst retaining the natural weeping shape, it is important to prune branches at convenient growth points where possible.",
