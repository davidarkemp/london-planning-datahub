  "description": "2 x Mature Purple Plum (applicants ref. T1, T2) - Approximately 7.00m: (Located outside of No.85): Thin crown density of both trees by approximately 25%-30%. Raise crowns by up to 0.75m. Reduce any extraneous over long branches back into main crown structure by up to 0.75m. To produce a more open, less dense crown structure. General maintenance.\r\rConifer (applicants ref. T3) - Approximately 7.00m-8.00m: (located behind No.99): Fell to as near to ground level as is practicable. The main central stem is totally dead and outer parts of the crown are beginning to die back. The tree is very unlikely to regenerate. Prevent possible hazard potential. \r\rAmelanchier (applicants ref. T4) - Approximately 5.00m: (Located behind No.104 & 105): Remove all dead stems. Retain lower crown structure. This tree has suffered from crown dieback. Weather conditions have added to its deterioration. General maintenance.\r\rGroup of flowering Cherries (applicants ref. G1) - Approximately 5.00m-6.00m; ( Lining the path opposite Grose House): Remove included secondary (potentially co-dominant) stem on the first tree to the left of the path. Reduce crowns of group by up to 1.20m all round to tidy. First tree of this group has a secondary stem growing with tight union. This will be a potential hazard/fault as the tree develops. General maintenance.\r\r6 x Semi Mature Cherries (applicants ref. G2) - Approximately 9.00m-10.00m: (Adjacent parking bays opposite Grose House): Reduce lateral and sub lateral branches which overhang parking bays only by up to 1.20m. Thin crown density of all trees by approximately 25% and remove dead wood. To control encroachment. General maintenance.",
