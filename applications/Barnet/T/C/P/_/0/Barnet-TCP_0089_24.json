Removing approximately 0.5 metres in height from crown and approximately 1 metre from side of crown.\r\rMy client has had consent from Hamstead Garden Trust for the above works.\rMy client also had previous consent for similar works on the above trees from Barnet council. No tree work took place and the consent has now expired.",
