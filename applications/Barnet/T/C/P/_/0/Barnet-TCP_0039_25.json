  "description": "5 x Hornbeam (applicants ref. H7, H8, H9, H10, H11) - Reduce the density by crown thinning approximately 30%. This should include the removal of any deadwood, lifting low branches to approximately 6.0m above ground level, and the\rnecessary shortening of long lateral branches encroaching over the boundary, ensuring the heights and basic shapes are retained. It is important to prune branches to a convenient growth point, rather than all round reduction or pollarding which is not permitted.",
