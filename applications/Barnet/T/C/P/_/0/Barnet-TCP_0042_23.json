T1) - Approximately 12.00m: Thin crown density throughout by approximately 20%. concentrating on the crown section growing towards the building (South). Branches should be thinned evenly out to their extremities to form a more uniform crown density. Reduce overlong extraneous branches back into main crown structure to form a compact structure (up to 1.25m). Raise crown by approximately 1.50m-2.00m. Manage the tree at reasonable dimensions for its location and increase light levels.",
