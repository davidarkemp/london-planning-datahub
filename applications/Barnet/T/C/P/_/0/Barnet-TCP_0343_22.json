  "description": "1 x Tamarix Tree - Remove. \r\rBarnet Council have confirmed the tree is not included in a Tree Preservation Order. Email attached in supporting documents. \r\rAs you can see from the attached photographs and drawings, the canopy of this this non native tree covers almost the entire garden affording no natural light to reach the garden floor. Furthermore, this tree sheds leaves and blossom all year round which involves constant clear up. The trees lower branches are well below adult male head hight (6ft) proving at best an annoyance, at worst an injury hazard. Also as seen by photographs 3 and 4 the tree is leaning at over a 45 degree angle and there are concerns that it could fall, causing potential damage to property.\r\rRemoval of this tree will enable us full use of the garden and allow us to plant species that encourage local wildlife. As a full time remote worker having usable outside space is vital for maintaining good mental health.",
