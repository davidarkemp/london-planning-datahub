  "description": "1 x Weeping Willow - Reduce the density by pollarding at previous pruning points, including the removal of dead wood, lifting of low branches, and the necessary re-shaping of the tree. The height may be reduced by removing the vertical growth in the upper crown whilst retaining the natural weeping shape, it is important to prune branches at convenient growth points where possible.\r\r1 x Cherry - Reduce the density by crown thinning approximately 25% including the removal of dead wood, lifting of low branches, and the necessary shaping of the tree, ensuring the height and basic shape is retained. It is important to prune branches at convenient growth points, rather than an all round reduction or pollarding which is not permitted.\r\r1 x Magnolia - Reduce the density by crown thinning approximately 20% including the removal of dead wood, lifting of low branches, and the necessary shaping of the tree, ensuring the height and basic shape is retained. Again it is important to prune branches at convenient growth points, rather than an all round reduction or pollarding which is not permitted.",
