  "description": "1 x Mature Goat Willow (applicants ref. T1) - Approximately 9.00m: Reduce crown by approximately 20-30%, approximately 3.00m all round, selecting suitable growth points and reducing overlong extraneous branches back into main crown structure.Thin crown density throughout by approximately 25%. Remove dead wood throughout crown. General maintenance.\r\r1 x Small Cherry (applicants ref. T2) - Approximately 5.00m: Fell to ground level. This tree has suffered some damage when a conifer collapsed on it. The tree had suffered crown dieback and has been partially surpressed by the large conifers adjacent. The tree has poor form and is very unlikely to regenerate to an acceptable level.",
