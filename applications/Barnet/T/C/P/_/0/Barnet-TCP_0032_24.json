  "description": "1 x Lombardy Poplar (applicants ref. T1) - Re-Reduce upper crown to most previous reduction points & Reduce extraneous growth to balance crown where required by no more than 2m.\r\r1 x Cherry (applicants ref. T2) - Crown thin by 10% and re-shape due to poor pruning out of main stem. Remove dead wood and raise the crown by approx 1m where required. \r\r3 x Ash (applicants ref. G1) - Group of 3 Ash Trees, single Ash tree & a twin stem Ash Tree - Crown thin by approx 25% and prune in any extraneous growth by approx 1.5m where required. Do not reduce the height or over all tree as this is not permitted. \r\r1 x Curly Willow (applicants ref. T3) - lightly thin by 10%. \r\r1 x Yew (applicants ref. T4) - Crown reduce the more bulbous side by approx 1.5m and shape to balance. Please note this will look bare for a considerable amount of time, removing screening and will take a few extra years to form into a tight hedge like canopy.",
