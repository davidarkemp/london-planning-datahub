This tree is too close in proximity to the building and is closely placed to another Hornbeam that has a natural open crown structure. We want to retain and allow to develop to full size.\r\r1 x Hornbeam (applicants ref. T2) - Approximately 9.00m-10.00m: Tip prune to reduce by approximately 1.20m.  Thin crown density by approximately 20%. Remove dead wood throughout. General maintenance.\r\r1 x Mature Beech (applicants ref. T3) - Approximately 9.00m: Reduce back to previous reduction points up to approximately 1.20m, reducing over extended branches back into main crown structure. Thin crown density throughout by approximately 20%. Remove dead wood. General maintenance.\r\r1 x Mature Japanese Maple (applicants ref. T4) - Approximately 4.00m: Thin crown density throughout by approximately 20% to open up branch structure visible from outside the crown. Tip prune to reduce over long branches back into main crown structure. General maintenance.",
