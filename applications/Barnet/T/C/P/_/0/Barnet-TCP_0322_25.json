  "description": "1 x Mature Fir (applicants ref. T1) - Approximately 11.00m.  Reduce over extended branches which protrude beyond the main crown structure back into the main crown line (approximately 1.25m).  Reduce crown height by approximately 1.25m whilst preserving shape.  Remove climbing plants and major dead wood.\r\r1 x Mature Purple Plum (applicants ref. T2) - Approximately 7.00-8.00m.  Reduce crown by approximately 30% (1.40m) all round.  Remove epicormic growth throughout.  Thin crown density by 20%.  Remove reverted sucker growth from ground level.  Remove dead wood.\r\r1 x Mature Yew (applicants ref. T3) - Approximately 3.50m. Reduce crown by approximately 0.75-1.00m.\r\r1 x Young Sycamore (applicants ref. T4) - Approximately 5.00m.  Fell to ground level and treat with systemic herbicide.\rReason:  This tree is fast growing quickly increasing in height and spread and will become too large for its location.\r\r1 x Large Viburnum (applicants ref. S1) - Reduce by approximately 1.50m. Reasons:  General maintenance and to increase light levels and control encroachment.",
