  "description": "1x Eucalyptus (Applicants Ref. T1) - A large tall tree with a significant lateral spread located 5m from house. Observations show historic damage at base and new visible cracks in the lower Trunk. Due to this damage and to minimise the risk of wind throw, with consideration to improve safety and the wish to retain the tree it should be crown reduced where required by approx 4-6m removing significant weight from the trees upper crown and lateral spread. These works will be carried out with forward planning of creating a more compact tree with a lower crown better suited for the trees location in close proximity to the house.",
