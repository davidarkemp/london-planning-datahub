  "description": "1 x Purple Plum (applicants ref. T1) - Approximately 8.00m. Thin crown density by approximately 30%. Remove dead wood.\r\r1 x Mature Hawthorn (applicants ref. T2) - Approximately 9.00m. Thin crown density by approximately 20%. Reduce extraneous overlong branches back into main crown structure (approximately 1.00-2.00m). Remove Clematis from the crown. Remove dead wood.\r\r1 x Mature Hawthorn (applicants ref. T3) - Approximately 9.00m. Reduce lateral and sub lateral branches which overhang the lawn by approximately 1.20m. Remove major dead wood.\r\r1 x Japanese Maple (applicants ref. T4) - Approximately 3.50m. Thin crown density by 20%. Reduce lateral and sub lateral growth by approximately 0.30-0.50m as is practicable to shape and balance crown.\r\r1 x Apple (applicants ref. T5) - Approximately 7.00m. Reduce crown by approximately 1.75m all round. Thin crown density by 20-25%. Remove dead wood.\r\r1 x Birch (applicants ref. T6) - Approximately 6.00m. Fell to ground level and remove root ball. Reason:  This tree is poorly formed and in poor condition. Crown dieback was noted.\r\r1 x Conifer (applicants ref. T7) - Approximately 7.00m.  Tip prune to reduce by approximately 1.00m.\r\r1 x Pyracantha (applicants ref. T8) - Reduce crown overhanging No.7 by approximately 1.50m.",
