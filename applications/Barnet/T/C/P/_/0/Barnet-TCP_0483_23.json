T2) - Reduce density by crown thinning approximately 20% including the removal of any dead wood, lifting of low branches and the necessary shaping of the tree, ensuring the basic shape of the tree is retained.  Prune branches at convenient growth points, not an all round reduction.\r\r1 x Paulownia (applicants ref. T3) - Possibly dying.  Add slow release fertiliser capsules around the base and spread of the tree.  Remove deadwood and shape as necessary.",
