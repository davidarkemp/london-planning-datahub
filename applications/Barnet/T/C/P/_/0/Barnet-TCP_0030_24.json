  "description": "1 x Oak (applicants ref. T1) - Reduce the density of the mature Oak tree situated un the central location on the bottom boundary fo the rear garden by crown thinning approximately 25% including the removal of dead wood, lifting of low branches, and the necessary shaping of the tree, ensuring the height and basic shape if retained. It is important to prune branches at convenient growth points, rather than an all  round reduction or pollarding which is not permitted. Reason - tree maintenance\r\r1 x Crab Apple (applicants ref. T2) - Reduce the height and density of the small Crab Apple situated on the right hand side boundary of the rear garden adjacent to Litchfield Road by crown thinning approximately 25% including the removal of dead wood, lifting of low branches, and the necessary shaping of the tree, ensuring a natural shape is retained.",
