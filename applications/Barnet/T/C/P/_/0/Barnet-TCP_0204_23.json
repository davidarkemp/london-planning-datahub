  "description": "1 x Magnolia (applicants ref. T1) - Crown thin by 30% to reduce the density of the tree. Raise the crown to give a balanced lift and cut back the branch growing over the driveway to suitable growth point maintaining the main limb. Remove dead wood. Do not reduce the height or the whole tree.\r\r1 x Apple Tree (applicants ref. T2) - Crown thin by approx 40%. (we may thin this less than 40% as that is quite a significant amount. This amount should be done over a few years to avoid mass re-growth). |Cut back from the building to give clearance of approx 1m. It has been suggested to raise the low branches but this will remove screening from the house behind.",
