  "description": "1 x Damson (applicants ref. T1) - Reduce the density by crown thinning approximately 20%, including the removal of dead wood, lifting of low branches over the footpath and necessary reshaping.\r\r1 x Birch (applicants ref. T2) - Reduce back to previous pruning point ensuring cuts are to a convenient spur, managing to create a natural shape.\r\r2 x Cypress (applicants ref. T3) - Remove and grub out roots.\r\r1 x Oak (applicants ref. T4) - Tip prune overhanging branches, remove dead wood and epicormic growth. Carry out minor reductions where practical 1-2m, pruning to a spur and ensure tree shape is managed sympathetically.\r\r1 x Apple (applicants ref. T5) - Carry out autumn pruning as required.",
