  "description": "1 x Maple (applicants ref. T1) - Crown reduce approx 1.5m to keep as a small specimen.\r\r2 x Conifers (applicants ref. T2) - Reduce in height to most previous and trim sides. \r\r1 x Ash (applicants ref. T3) - Self seeded. Fell before it matures into large tree in wrong location due to historic structural foundation issues with the house. \r\r1 x Weeping Willow (aplicants ref. T4) - Reduce in height to previous reduction points by approx 3m leaving weeping furnishing growth. This will leave the tree looking bare but should be kept at its pollarded height due to historic structural issues with the house. \r\r1 x Oak (applicants ref. T5) - Remove dead limb over pavement.",
