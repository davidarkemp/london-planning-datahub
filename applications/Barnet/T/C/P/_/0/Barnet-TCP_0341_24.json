Reduce the overhang over the flat roof of number 73 by approximately 2m in order to prevent damage to the building from branches and falling leaves and to balance crown of tree.\r\r1 x Birch (applicants ref. T2) - Reduce height and lateral spread by up to 3m. This is to prevent future failure of branches or tree \r\r1 x Birch (applicants ref. T3) - Reduce height and lateral spread by up to 3m in order to prevent failure of main leader and balance overextending branches. This tree has wound at approximately 10m which looks as though decay has entered the main stem. Approximately 4m below current height.\r\r1 x Lawson Cypress (applicants ref.
