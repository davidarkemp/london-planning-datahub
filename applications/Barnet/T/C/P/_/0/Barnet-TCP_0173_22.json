  "description": "1 x Eucalyptus - Thin crown by 30%, to include removal of secondary and epicormic growth throughout the canopy with final cuts made to the branch collar to produce an even density of foliage around a well-spaced and balanced branch structure, increasing substantial light, airflow and reducing the weight loading on limbs and wind resistance to B.S.3998:13.6.1-2. Remove all major dead and diseased wood and generally clean up canopy. Top out new vertical growth but leave in a natural canopy shape, rather than a topiary effect.\r\r1 x Acacia - Reduce and shape crown(s) by approximately 20%, removing lateral growth by approximately 1-2m, cutting back to nearest suitable growing point, to leave a flowing branch line without stumps and the main canopy framework to B.S.3998:13.4.1. (Please Note: The % relates just to the tree canopy and not the entire tree height). Remove all major dead and diseased wood and generally clean up canopy. Remove lower branches to a vertical height of 2.5-3m, above ground level or raised surface, removing entire branches, or part of same that extend below the specific clearance height, with final cuts made to the branch collar or nearest growing point, B.S.3998:13.5.",
