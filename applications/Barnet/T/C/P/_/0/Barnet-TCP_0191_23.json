Remove the southern stem of the western tree back to fence line, which will mean cutting back near the ground. There is sufficient growth towards the south so that the tree is not unbalanced. Reduce the length of overhanging branches to parent stem or by 2 to 3m as required by fencing - reason to enable fence installation.\r\r2 x Pine (applicants ref. T4, T6) - Crown lift to 3m on northern side and remove dead wood from all over the crown. Reason, to provide clearance for garden use and for safety reasons.\r\r1 x Pine (applicants ref.
