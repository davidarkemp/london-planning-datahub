The tree is growing in a location with restricted rooting, the base is solid sounding to mallet with no obvious bleeds, cankers or fungi, so we conclude the dieback evident is the result of damaged / restricted roots.  Whilst the felling of the tree is not strictly necessary, it would essentially be destroyed were the dead tissue removed. Replacement planting comprising native species such as field maple to be provided in a suitable location in the site's frontage.",
