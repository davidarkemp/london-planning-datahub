Reducing the tree will help to reduce the weight on the tree as the tree has a massive decay at the crown of the tree.

The client is wanting to obtain more light into the rear garden due to health issues. Thinning out this tree and removing the deadwood will help more light into the garden as well as maintaining a healthy shape and size of the tree.",
