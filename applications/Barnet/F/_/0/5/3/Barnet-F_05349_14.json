  "description": "In connection with the creation of an Eruv in Golders Green, the construction of pole and wire gateways, 1m high posts known as 'leci' and fencing at the following locations:\rSite 8a:  Farm Avenue, adjacent to no. 50 to the flank wall of 2 Hocroft Road (2x 5.5 meter high poles)\rSite 8b:  Farm Avenue, flank of 13 Farm Avenue to flank wall of 11 Farm Avenue (2x 5.5m high poles and connecting wire)\rThe proposals are an amendment to the previous ERUV approved under reference F/00171/14\r*An Eruv is a continuous boundary designated in accordance with Jewish Law. Orthodox Jewish Law prohibits carrying on the Sabbath. However, carrying, which includes pushing wheelchairs and pushchairs, is permitted within an Eruv. The Eruv boundary is formed by utilising continuous local features such as fences or walls alongside roads, railways or terraced buildings. Where this continuity is broken by gaps e.g. roads, 'gateways' are created consisting of poles linked on top by a wire crossing the highway. Where the boundary is broken by a route crossing under it, the boundary is continued by the installation of a leci. Leci are vertical batons, 1m high, usually sited inside bridge arches. \r",
