This sound insulation shall ensure that the levels of noise generated from the (specified use) as measured within the habitable rooms of the development shall be no higher than 35dB(A) from 7am to 11pm and 30dB(A) in bedrooms from 11pm to 7am. In addition, as set out in the Noise Impact Assessment by Alpha Acoustics, dated 12 May 2015, the recommended sound insulation mitigation measures shall be implemented in their entirety before the use commences\". \r",
