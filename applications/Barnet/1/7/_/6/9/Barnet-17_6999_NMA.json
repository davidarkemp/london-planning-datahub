  "description": "Non material amendment to planning permission 15/04677/HSE dated 16/09/2015 for `Single storey rear extension, conversion of garage into habitable room facilitated by single storey side extension, first floor side extension, extension to existing roof to facilitate a loft conversion and addition of a boundary wall and hedge to the front of the property and 9 new rooflights.` Amendments include amendments to the rear extension and garden steps to run parallel to the main house rather than at an angle. Relocation and resizing the proposed rooflights in the rear extension to maximise daylight. Add high level east and west facing windows to the proposed rear extension to take advantage of the orientation of the property and provide cross ventilation. Change the proposed cladding material of the rear extension from slate to ceramic",
