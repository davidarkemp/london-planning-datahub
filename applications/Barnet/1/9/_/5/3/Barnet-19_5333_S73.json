  "description": "Variation of condition 1 (Plan Numbers) pursuant to planning permission 18/2028/HSE dated 03/04/2018 for `Single storey rear extension and new raised patio.  Construction of a rear dormer window and  1no front rooflight associated with a loft conversion.  Replacement of all windows with double glazing. Conversion of garage into habitable room, insertion of bay window to replace existing garage door and insertion of oriel bay window on first floor side elevation.` Amendments include relocation of southern roof light on the existing hipped roof to be further south as existing framing leaves little room for its installation in the approved location. Addition of 2no rooflights to the existing loft level. Alterations to make all rooflights openable. Addition of new window to south dormer extension cheek wall to increase natural daylight to loft level. Amendment of the first floor south-facing window to become a pop-out oriel window similar to a bay window with bifold opening panels and amendment of size and position of south facing windows at ground floor level to improve security",
