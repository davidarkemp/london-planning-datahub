  "description": "Installation of railings and access gate to the front boundary wall\r\rThe existing wall is 800mm high from footpath level, or 600mm high from property level.\r\rThe proposed metal posts for the railing which will be bolted down onto the existing wall, are 500mm high, the railing height is 395mm and gate height is 1045 mm. \r\rThe total ground to top height will be 1300mm high from the footpath level or 1100mm from property level.\r\rThe primary purpose for fitting the railings is to keep our young children safe and secure from the road; whilst also improving the appearance of the property.\r\rWe believe the proposal is in keeping with the neighbourhood, as there are a wide variety of front walls and railings which are not uniform in their appearance (height, colour, design). We have attached photos as examples of some.",
