  "description": "Submission of details of Condition 3 (Materials) pursuant to planning permission 24/4522/HSE dated 09/01/2025\r\rThe materials used for the chimney stack reconstruction, which were also approved by the Hampstead Garden Suburb Trust, were new Swanage red imperial bricks mixed with bricks retained from the previous chimney stack. The older bricks take up about a quarter of the total bricks and were mixed in among the new bricks. The rebuild followed the approved drawings including following the exact brick bond and recesses, and requiring the bricks to be cut for the headers and queen closers. \r\rThe pointing is a mix of 1 part OPC: 1 part hydrated lime: 2 parts building sand: 3 parts sharp sand. As per the Hampstead Garden Suburb Trusts pointing guidance, the joints to the rebuilt chimney, were not struck but were tamped back nominally from the face of the brick.\r\rAs per the drawings, Clement 0 and Clement 1 windows were used for the conservation rooflights.\r\rConfirmation of hardstanding materials is that York stone slabs  will be used and that brick edgings will match existing.",
