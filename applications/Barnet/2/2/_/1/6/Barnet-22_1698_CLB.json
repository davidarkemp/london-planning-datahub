  "description": "Reinstatement of property following localised subsidence related damage.  Works will involve raking out of cracking to the rear elevation and within the ground floor open porch area to the rear, testing the mortar removed to as closely match the new mortar mix as is possible, before then repointing the open joints to match original.  If any cracked bricks are found, then these will be very carefully removed and replaced with appropriate brickwork. (An application has also been submitted to HGST)",
