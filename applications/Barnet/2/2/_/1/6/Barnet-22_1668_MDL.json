  "description": "To modify the original S106 (schedule 3 and associated sections) dated 10th November 2015 and subsequent S106 Deed of Variations to remove the obligation of on-site affordable housing provision and replace with a commuted sum. Onsite provision can not be fulfilled owing to the absence of interest from Registered Providers to acquire the affordable units. The approach to providing a commuted sum in lieu of on-site provision is supported in the accompanying Development Viability Report producted by Bespoke Property Consultants.",
