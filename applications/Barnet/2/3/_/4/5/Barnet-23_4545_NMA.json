  "description": "Application pursuant to Section 96A of the Town and Country Planning Act for a non-material amendment to planning permission 17/6714/EIA dated 30 October 2018 for the Waste Transfer Station and associated A5 Edgware road/ Geron way junction improvements.  The application proposes amendments to Condition 2 (Approved Plans) following the detailed design of the A5 Edgware road /Geron way highway junction alignment. The amendments include relocating the A5 Edgware road southbound bus stop from north of the junction to south of the junction to improve forward visibility, moving the stop line on Geron way to improve junction inter-visibility, enable southbound traffic to turn right into Hanover House and the Builders Depot and include an additional signal phase for traffic exiting the Builders Depot and turning north onto the A5 Edgware road.",
