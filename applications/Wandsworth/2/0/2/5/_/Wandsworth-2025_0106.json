    "Reason : 1 - The application, by reason of the insufficient details provided relating to the BREEAM Interim Certificate, BREEAM Final Certificate, Water Efficiency Details and Insulation and Sound, fails to adequately meet the criteria for the discharge of conditions 4, 5, 6 and 7 of planning permission dated 17/10/2024 ref 2023/4106 and therefore fail to accord with policies LP1, LP2, LP10 and  LP14 of the Local Plan (2023). \r\n\r\nBy reason of its inappropriate siting would adversely affect the character, appearance and visual amenity of the streetscene. In addition, it would affect the pedestrian safety in this location. In accordance with policy LP1 and LP2 of the Wandsworth Local Plan 2023, Condition 8 of planning permission dated 17/10/2024 ref 2023/4106 can therefore not be discharged at this time.\r\n\r\n"
