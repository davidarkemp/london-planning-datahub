  "site_name": null,
  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed two storey side extension, roof extension, alteration of the front roof pitch and timber terrace screening by reason of their scale, design and location would result in a highly prominent, unsympathetic and incongruous form of development that would relate poorly to and dominate the host building while being visually conspicuous within the adjoining local area, exerting harm to the character and appearance of the street scene. The proposal therefore fails to comply with policies LP1 and LP5 of the Wandsworth Local Plan (2023), and the Wandsworth Housing SPD (2016).\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed roof terrace, due to the inadequate height and design of side screening, would result in actual and perceived overlooking into neighbouring properties at Nos. 1 and 5 Pickets Road, causing an unacceptable loss of privacy. Furthermore, its close proximity to the first- and second-floor windows of No. 5 raises concerns over potential noise and disturbance. The proposal would therefore have a detrimental impact on neighbouring residential amenity and fails to comply with Policy LP2 of the Wandsworth Local Plan (2023) and the Housing SPD (2016).\r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
