  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed roof terrace by reason of it location, scale and design would present an inappropriate precedent, which leaves the development open to piecemeal and sporadic development at roof level, adding unnecessary clutter to the terrace and potential harming the productivity of existing sustainability measures. The terrace would be widely visible and would appear out of keeping with the proposed development and would raise both overlooking and noise concerns to surrounding properties. The development fails to meet with Local plan policies LP1, LP2, LP3 and LP5.\r\n\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
