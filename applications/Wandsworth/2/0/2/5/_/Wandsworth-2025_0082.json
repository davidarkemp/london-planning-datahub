The cumulative measured or calculated rating level of noise emitted from the air-conditioning units to which this application refers, shall be 5dB(A) below the existing background noise level at all times that they are in operation. The measured or calculated noise levels shall be determined at the boundary of the nearest ground floor noise sensitive premises or one metre from the fa�ade of the nearest first floor (or higher) noise sensitive premises, in accordance with the latest British Standard 4142.\r\nReason: To protect the amenities of neighbouring occupiers, in accordance with policies LP1 and LP2 of the Local Plan."
