    "Reason : 1 - By reason of design, scale and location, the proposed roof extension would form a prominent, unsympathetic and visually intrusive addition to the original building, streetscene and locality. The proposal visually disrupts the existing attractive roofscape to the harm of the character and appearance of the property, the terrace it forms part of and the wider streetscene and is contrary to the NPPF (2024), policies LP1 and LP5 of the Wandsworth Local Plan (2023) and the Housing (2016).",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
