    "Reason : 1 - The proposal constitutes development under the Town and Country Planning Act 1990, and the local planning authority is not satisfied that, based on the drawings submitted as part of the application, this proposal falls within any class of 'permitted development' specified within Schedule 2, Part 16 to the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).\r\nINFORMATIVE: The proposed development is not considered a replacement mast, whilst a mst may be removed in the current location, the proposed mast is in a completely different location and therefore is considered to be result in the installation of a new mast. As considered a new mast siting and design should be considered and in this case, its scale and design as well as the substantial harm it would cause to the setting of adjoining listed Grade II Fairacres Estate and its curtilage is is considered inappropriate. \r\n"
