    "Reason : 1 - By reason of its size, siting and design, the proposed extension would constitute an unsympathetic and incongruous form of development in a prominent location visible from Ashbury Road. It would relate poorly to, and cause harm to, the architectural integrity of the host property and the adjoining row of terraced properties and the Shaftesbury Park Estate Conservation Area. The proposal would therefore be contrary to the NPPF (2024), policies LP1, LP3 and LP5 of the Wandsworth Local Plan (2023), and the design guidance provided in the Housing SPD (2016).",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
