    "Reason : 1 - The proposal constitutes development under the Town and Country Planning Act 1990, and the local planning authority is not satisfied that, based on the drawings submitted as part of the application, this proposal falls within any class of 'permitted development' specified within Schedule 2 to the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).\r\n\r\nINFORMATIVE: The proposed development fails to comply with section (i) of Class A of Part 1, Schedule 2 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended) as the higher section of the proposed extension would have an eaves height of over 3metres and be located within 2 metres of the boundary of teh curtilage.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, it is noted that the proposed plans are inaccurate or deviate plan by plan in relation to the height of the works. In addition, the application description provided differing information on the scale of the development. The application has therefore failied to provide accurate information as set out in condition A.4 of Class A of Part 1, Schedule 2 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).  \r\n\r\n"
