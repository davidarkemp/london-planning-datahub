    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development, by reason of its scale, bulk and design, would be inappropriate and out of context, resulting in the overdevelopment of the site and would form an unduly dominant and visually intrusive addition that would be harmful to the amenity of surrounding properties and the character and appearance of the host property and its setting within the terrace, contrary to policies LP1, LP2 and LP5 of the Local Plan (2023), the Housing SPD (2016) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2024).",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
