  "description": "TPO 100/1971 T15 Common Oak T16 Red Oak\r\nThe proposed 2m reductions were in line with previous management cycles and aimed at maintaining the trees at a sustainable size through re-pruning back to established reduction points. These works are not considered excessive and are considered good arboricultural practice for long-term health and safety. We are surprised to see our previous application (APPLICATION NUMBER: 2025/1678) refused on the basis of ???no arboricultural reason,??? particularly as this level of work has been routinely approved in the past. There is no suggestion that the trees were previously mismanaged, nor that this re-entry would cause harm. Furthermore, it is unusual that no alternative specification was suggested, which would typically allow for a constructive adjustment rather than outright refusal. In light of the above, we would appreciate confirmation as to whether the Council would be willing to approve the specifications: T15 English Oak: Current Height: Approx. 18 metres Current Lateral Spread: Approx. 9 metres Proposed Works: Carry out a crown reduction by up to 1.5???2 metres in height and lateral spread to previous reduction points. Final height after works: approx. 16???16.5 metres Final lateral spread: approx. 7???7.5 metres All cuts to be made to suitable secondary growth points in line with BS 3998 (2010). Tree to be left with a natural, balanced shape. Reason for Works: Routine cyclical maintenance to manage crown size, maintain previous reduction framework, improve light penetration, and reduce mechanical stress on extended limbs. T16 Red Oak: Current Height: Approx. 17 metres Current Lateral Spread: Approx. 8 metres Proposed Works: Carry out a crown reduction by up to 1.5???2 metres in height and lateral spread, returning to previous pruning points. Final height after works: approx. 15???15.5 metres Final lateral spread: approx. 6???6.5 metres All cuts to be made to appropriate secondary branches, preserving the natural form. Re",
