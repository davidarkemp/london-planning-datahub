    "Reason : 1 - The development would involve the conversion of a property consisting of less than 130 square metres of habitable floorspace as originally constructed, which is not unsuitable for family accommodation. The development would therefore result in harm to the quality and mix of the local housing stock and be contrary to policy LP26 of the Wandsworth Local Plan (2023).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed development, by reason of the size of Flat 1 and Flat 2 would fail to meet minimum Gross Internal Area (GIA) for self-contained residential dwellings; and a section drawing has not been provided to demonstrate satisfactory floor to ceiling heights to each of the flats. The proposal would therefore provide a substandard level of accommodation for future occupiers and be contrary to policy LP27 of the Wandsworth Local Plan (2023), the Technical Housing Standards - Nationally Described Space Standard (2015) and NPPF (2024).",
    "Reason : 3 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
