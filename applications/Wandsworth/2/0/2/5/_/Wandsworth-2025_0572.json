    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development, by reason of its scale, design and location would result in an unneighbourly form of development that harms the amenity of the neighbouring occupiers at No.16 Eland Road in the form of loss daylight/sunlight, outlook, being overbearing and creating an increased sense of enclosure. The proposal therefore fails to comply with policy LP2 of the Wandsworth Local Plan (2023) and the Wandsworth Housing SPD (2016).  ",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan and Supplementary Planning documents as well as offering a full pre application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably. In addition further guidance was offered to the applicant by the case officer during the processing of the application to identify amendments to address those elements of the scheme considered unacceptable. \r\n\r\n"
