    "Reason : 1 - By reason of their design, siting, scale and materials the extensions and alterations to the front and rear roof would form prominent, unsympathetic and visually intrusive additions to the harm of the character and appearance of the original building, streetscene and Clapham Common Conservation Area. The identified harm would not be outwewighed by any public benefit derived from the devfelopment. The proposal would therefore be contrary to the NPPF (2024), Policies LP1, LP3 and LP5 of the Wandsworth Local Plan (2023) and the Housing (2016).",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan as well as offering a full pre application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably."
