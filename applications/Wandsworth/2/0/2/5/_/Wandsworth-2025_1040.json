    "Condition : 1 - (a) Any advertisement displayed and any site used for the display of advertisements shall be retained in a clean and tidy condition to the reasonable satisfaction of the local planning authority. \r\n(b) Any structure or hoarding erected or used principally for the purpose of displaying advertisements shall be maintained in a safe condition. \r\n(c) Where an advertisement is required under these Town and Country Planning (Control of Advertisement) (England) Regulations 2007 to be removed, the removal shall be carried out to the reasonable satisfaction of the local planning authority. \r\n(d) No advertisement shall be displayed without the permission of the owner of the site or any other person with an interest in the site entitled to grant permission. \r\n(e) No advertisement shall be sited or displayed so as to obscure or hinder the ready interpretation of any road traffic sign, railway signal or aid to navigation by water or air, or so as otherwise to render hazardous the use of any highway, railway, waterway or aerodrome (civil or military).\r\nReason: To comply with Regulation 14(1) and Schedule 2 of the Town and Country Planning (Control of Advertisement) (England) Regulations 2007 and to comply with paragraph 141 of the National Planning Policy Framework.\r\n",
    "Condition : 2 - The maximum steady brightness of any sign is not to exceed 600 candelas per sq. m during daylight hours and 280 candelas per sq. m between dusk and dawn. The levels of luminance on the digital signs should be controlled by light sensors to measure the ambient brightness and dimmers to control the lighting output to within these limits. \r\nReason: To ensure the sign does not have an adverse effect on the amenity of the area in accordance with Council policy LP9 of the Local Plan (2023) and to comply with paragraph 141 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2024).",
    "Condition : 3 - The advertisements must be static and contain no moving features, flashing, animation, intermittent light source or exposed cold cathode tubing. Sequential advertisements displayed via the LED unit permitted by this consent shall not change more than once every 10 seconds. The interval between successive displays shall take place over a period no greater than one second; the complete screen shall change with no visual effects (including fading, swiping or other animated transition methods) between displays and the display will include a mechanism to freeze the image in the event of a malfunction.\r\nReason: To safeguard the amenities of nearby residents in accordance with Council policy LP9 of the Local Plan (2023) and to comply with paragraph 141 of the NPPF (2024). \r\n",
    "Condition : 4 - No advertisement displayed shall resemble traffic signs, as defined in section 64 of the Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984.\r\nReason: In the interest of highway safety and of the visual amenities of the locality in accordance with Council policy LP9 of the Local Plan (2023) and to comply with paragraph 141 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2024). ",
    "Condition : 5 - No music or sound shall be emitted from the advertisements.\r\nReason: In the interest of highway safety and of the visual amenities of the locality in accordance with Council policy LP9 of the Local Plan (2023) and to comply with paragraph 141 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2024). ",
    "Condition : 6 - INFORMATIVE: The footway and carriageway on St John's Hill must not be blocked during the construction and maintenance of the proposal. Temporary obstructions during the installation of the advertisement screen must be kept to a minimum and should not encroach on the clear space needed to provide a safe passage for pedestrians, or obstruct the flow of traffic on St John's Hill. All vehicles associated with the installation of the signage must only park/stop at permitted locations and within the time periods permitted by existing on street restrictions. No skips or construction materials shall be kept on the footway or carriageway at any time.  \r\nNo development shall take place until the existing Inlink Unit  shown on Plan No: 24007404_PLN_EL_3.1 is removed in its entirety and the land made good to the same condition as the surrounding land.\r\n"
