  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed communication hub, by reason of its scale, design and location would be a discordant and obtrusive feature that would fail to minimise street clutter and result in harm to the character and appearance of the local area. Furthermore, the hub would create an unnecessary obstruction of the public space and line of sight of vehicle users, hindering the convenient and safe passage of pedestrians. The proposal therefore fails to comply with the National Planning Policy Framework (2024), the London Plan (2021), policies LP1, LP9, LP22 and LP50 of the Local Plan (2023).",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
