  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed signage is related to a refused development under planning application 2024/0224 which was refused in principle due to its design having a less than significant impact onto the setting of the Grade II/II* Ram Brewery Complex without justification or public benefits to outweigh the identified harm. As such, the signage would fail to meet the requirements of Section 16 of the NPPF, London Plan Policy HC1 and Local Plan Policies LP1 and LP3. ",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
