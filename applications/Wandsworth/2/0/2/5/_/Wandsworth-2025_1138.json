  "description": "T1 Lime - Fell Structural Decay and Cavities The tree presents visible decay pockets, which are indicative of internal breakdown of structural tissue. These cavities can compromise the tree's overall integrity, increasing the risk of stem or limb failure. Decay in lime trees often originates from previous pollarding wounds or pruning cuts, leading to fungal colonisation and a weakening of core wood. Exposed and Compromised Root System The tree exhibits exposed surface roots, potentially caused by soil erosion or historic ground disturbance. This can lead to reduced anchorage and greater vulnerability to windthrow, particularly in saturated ground conditions. In addition, root damage or decay may already be present, which cannot always be fully assessed without invasive investigation (e.g., air spade or ground-penetrating radar). Excessive Suckering and High Maintenance Lime trees are known for prolific basal and epicormic suckering, particularly when stressed or repeatedly pollarded. This requires frequent cyclical maintenance, currently estimated at every 2???3 years, to manage both form and safety ??? an unsustainable burden for many private garden settings. Awkward Position in Garden Context The tree is situated in an awkward position, limiting access for maintenance and increasing the risk of damage to surrounding structures or landscape features during pruning operations. Its position may also cause disproportionate shading, root competition, or conflict with intended garden use or development. Lifecycle and Species Considerations While lime is a long-lived species, mature specimens in suboptimal conditions (restricted root space, historic pollarding, or urban garden settings) can deteriorate structurally well before their natural lifespan. Removal at this stage may allow for more appropriate replanting with a lower-maintenance and site-suitable species.",
