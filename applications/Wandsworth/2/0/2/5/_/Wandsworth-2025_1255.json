    "Condition : 4 - Prior to occupation of the development the windows in the northeastern side elevation at ground-floor, first-floor and second-floor levels of the development shall be obscure-glazed and non-opening (unless the parts of the window which can be opened are more than 1.7 metres above the floor of the room in which the window is installed).  The windows shall so be maintained and retained as such. \r\nReason: To control overlooking and safeguard the privacy of neighbours in accordance with Council policy LP2 of the Wandsworth Local Plan (adopted August 2023) coupled with the requirements of the National Planning Policy Framework.\r\n",
    "Condition : 5 - The flat roof area of the ground-floor rear/side extension hereby permitted shall not be used as a balcony, roof garden or similar amenity area and furthermore, no balustrades, railings or other means of enclosure or means of permanent access shall be erected on this area.\r\nReason: To control overlooking and safeguard the privacy of neighbours in accordance with Council policies LP1 and LP2 of the Local Plan coupled with the requirements of the National Planning Policy Framework.\r\n",
    "Condition : 6 - INFORMATIVE: In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. The Council has made available detailed advice in the form of its statutory policies in the Local Plan (2023) as well as offering a full pre-application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably. In addition, where appropriate, further guidance was offered to the applicant during the processing of the application.",
    "Condition : 7 - INFORMATIVE: The developer must ensure that their proposal, both during construction and after completion does not:\r\n- encroach onto Network Rail land\r\n- affect the safety, operation or integrity of the companyï¿½s railway and its infrastructure\r\n- undermine its support zone\r\n- damage the companyï¿½s infrastructure\r\n- place additional load on cuttings\r\n- adversely affect any railway land or structure\r\n- over-sail or encroach upon the air-space of any Network Rail land\r\n- cause to obstruct or interfere with any works or proposed works or Network Rail development both now and in the future",

Therefore, any buildings are required to be situated at least 2 metres (3m for\r\noverhead lines and third rail) from Network Railï¿½s boundary.\r\nThis requirement will allow for the construction and future maintenance of a building without the need to access\r\nthe operational railway environment. Any less than 2m (3m for overhead lines and third rail) and there is\r\na strong possibility that the applicant (and any future resident) will need to utilise Network Rail land and air-space\r\nto facilitate works as well as adversely impact upon Network Railï¿½s maintenance teamsï¿½ ability to maintain\r\nour boundary fencing and boundary treatments. Access to Network Railï¿½s land may not always be granted and if\r\ngranted may be subject to railway site safety requirements and special provisions with all associated railway costs\r\ncharged to the applicant.\r\nAs mentioned above, any works within Network Railï¿½s land would need approval from the Network Rail Asset\r\nProtection Engineer. This request should be submitted at least 20 weeks before any works are due to commence\r\non site and the applicant is liable for all associated costs (e.g., a l l possession, site safety, asset protection presence\r\ncosts). However, Network Rail is not required to grant permission for any third-party access to its land.\r",
    "Condition : 9 - INFORMATIVE: All operations, including the use of cranes or other mechanical plant working adjacent to Network Railï¿½s\r\nproperty, must at all times be carried out in a \"fail safe\" manner such that in the event of mishandling, collapse or failure, no plant or materials are capable of falling within 3.0m of the boundary with Network Rail.\r\n",
    "Condition : 10 - INFORMATIVE: Storm/surface water must not be discharged onto Network Railï¿½s property or into Network Railï¿½s culverts or \r\ndrains except by agreement with Network Rail. Suitable drainage or other works must be provided and maintained\r\nby the Developer to prevent surface water flows or run-off onto Network Railï¿½s property. Proper provision must be\r\nmade to accept and continue drainage discharging from Network Railï¿½s property; full details to be submitted for\r\napproval to the Network Rail Asset Protection Engineer. Suitable foul drainage must be provided separate from\r\nNetwork Railï¿½s existing drainage. Soakaways, as a means of storm/surface water disposal must not be constructed\r\nwithin 20 metres of Network Railï¿½s boundary or at any point which could adversely affect the stability of Network\r\nRailï¿½s property. After the completion and occupation of the development, any new or exacerbated problems\r\nattributable to the newdevelopmentshall be investigated and remedied at the applicantsï¿½ expense.",
    "Condition : 11 - INFORMATIVE: Any scaffold which is to be constructed within 10 metres of the railway boundary fence must be erected in\r\nsuch a manner that at no time will any poles over-sail the railway and protective netting around such scaffold\r\nmust be installed. The applicant/applicantï¿½s contractor must consider if they can undertake the works and\r\nassociated scaffold/accessfor working at height within the footprint of their property boundary.",
    "Condition : 12 - INFORMATIVE: Where vibro-compaction/displacement piling plant is to be used in development, details of the use of such\r\nmachinery and a method statement should be submitted for the approval of the Network Railï¿½s Asset\r\nProtection Engineer prior to the commencement of works and the works shall only be carried out in\r\naccordance with the approved method statement.",
    "Condition : 13 - INFORMATIVE: In view of the nature of the development, it is essential that the developer provide (at their own expense) and\r\nthereafter maintain a substantial,trespass prooffence along the developmentside of the existing boundary fence,\r\nto a minimum height of 1.8 metres. The 1.8m fencing should be adjacent to the railway boundary and the\r\ndeveloper/applicant should make provision for its future maintenance and renewal without encroachment upon\r\nNetwork Rail land. Network Railï¿½s existing fencing / wall must not be removed or damaged and at no point during\r\nor post construction should the foundations of the fencing or wall or any embankment therein, be damaged,\r\nundermined or compromised in anyway.Any vegetationwithinNetwork Railï¿½sland boundary must not be disturbed.\r\nAny fencing installed by the applicant must not prevent Network Rail from maintaining its own fencing/boundary\r\ntreatment.",
    "Condition : 14 - INFORMATIVE: Any lighting associated with the development (including vehicle lights) must not interfere with the sighting of\r\nsignalling apparatus and/or train driversï¿½ vision on approaching trains. The location and colour of lights must not\r\ngive rise to the potential for confusion with the signalling arrangements on the railway. The developers should\r\nobtain Network Railï¿½s Asset Protection Engineerï¿½s approval of their detailed proposals regarding lighting. ",
    "Condition : 15 - INFORMATIVE: The potential for any noise/vibration impacts caused by the proximity between the proposed development\r\nand any existing railway should be made aware to the future occupiers of the site. It must also be assessed in the\r\ncontext of the National Planning Policy Framework which holds relevant national guidance information.\r\nThe current level of usage may be subject to change at any time without notification including increased frequency\r\nof trains, night-time train running and heavy freight trains. The appropriate building materials should be used to \r\nreduce any potential noise disturbance from the railway. ",
    "Condition : 16 - INFORMATIVE: Where a proposal calls for hard standing area/parking of vehicles area near the boundary with the operational\r\nrailway, Network Rail would recommend the installation of a highways approved vehicle incursion barrier or high\r\nkerbs to prevent vehicles accidentally driving or rolling onto the railway or damaging lineside fencing.",
    "Condition : 17 - INFORMATIVE: Any trees/shrubs to be planted adjacent to the railway boundary these shrubs should be positioned at a minimum \r\ndistance greater than their predicted mature height from the boundary. Certain broad leaf deciduous species \r\nshould not be planted adjacent to the railway boundary as the species will contribute to leaf fall which will have a \r\ndetrimental effect on the safety and operation of the railway. Network Rail wish to be involved in the approval of \r\nany landscaping scheme adjacent to the railway. Any hedge planted adjacent to Network Railï¿½s boundary fencing \r\nfor screening purposes should be so placed that when fully grown it does not damage the fencing or provide a \r\nmeans of scaling it. No hedge should prevent Network Rail from maintaining its boundary fencing. If required, \r\nNetwork Railï¿½s Asset Protection team are able to provide more details on which trees/shrubs are permitted within \r\nclose proximity to the railway. \r\nIf you would like to discuss any of the above, please contact AssetProtectionSouthern@networkrail.co.uk.

Network Rail request all existing rights, covenants and easements are retained unless \r\nagreed otherwise with Network Rail.\r\nNotwithstanding the above, if any property rights are required from Network Rail in order to deliver the \r\ndevelopment, Network Railï¿½s Property team will need to be contacted. ",
    "Condition : 19 - INFORMATIVE: It should be noted that where any Network Rail land, rights over Network Rail land, interfaces with Network Railï¿½s \r\nland or rights, or variations to Network Railï¿½s land or rights, is required for the facilitation, delivery, or operation of \r\na development, Network Rail will act in accordance with its Shared Value Policy. Network Railï¿½s Shared Value Policy \r\nis available online, or via request to Network Rail Property. Network Railï¿½s Southern Property Team would advise \r\nparties seek to raise Shared Value early in discussion with Network Rail, but reserve the right to implement the \r\nShared Value Policy at any time during discussions. \r\nIf a Network Rail Southern Property contact is required, please contact southernproperty@networkrail.co.uk",
    "Condition : 20 - INFORMATIVE: Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL): From the information available, it appears that the development permitted is subject to a Community Infrastructure Levy charge in accordance with the Community Infrastructure Levy Regulations 2010 (as amended).
