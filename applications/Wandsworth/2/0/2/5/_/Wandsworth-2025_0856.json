    "Reason : 1 - By reason of its scale, design, siting and prominence, the roof terrace would be a visually dominant, unsympathetic and incongruous addition, resulting in harm upon the host dwelling and the terrace it forms part of, thus failing to preserve the character and appearance of the Clapham Common Conservation Area. There are no public benefits to outweigh the less than substantial harm identified.  The proposed development is therefore contrary to the NPPF (2024), Policy HC1 of the London Plan,  Policies LP1, LP3 and LP5 of the Wandsworth Local Plan (2023), The Housing SPD (2016) and the Clapham Common  Conservation Area Appraisal and Management Strategy (2007).",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
