  "id": "Wandsworth-2025_0648",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The development, by reason of loss of historic fabric and the siting, form, height and bulk of the proposed roof extension would harm the character, appearance and significance of the Conservation Area. By reason of its siting, form and height it would harm the setting and thus significance of the former Church of St Philip (Grade II).  This would result in harm to the character and appearance of the Park Town Estate Conservation Area, which would not be outweighed by public benefits. As such, the proposal would be contrary to Section 72(1) of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act (1990), the NPPF (2024), policies LP1, LP3 and LP5 of the Wandsworth Local Plan (2023), the Housing SPD (2016) and Park Town Estate Conservation Area Appraisal and Management Strategy.  ",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed development would comprise a five-storey 'mid-rise' development outside of an identified 'mid-rise' zone. The proposal would therefore be an inappropriate form of development in this location and runs contrary to the design-led approach to height and growth and is contrary to policy LP4 of the Wandsworth Local Plan (2023).",
    "Reason : 3 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
