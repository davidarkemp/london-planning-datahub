  "description": "Alterations including erection of mansard roof extension to main rear roof (with French doors and safety railings) and extension above part of two-storey back addition; formation of roof terraces at first and second floor level with 1.7m high screen surround. Erection of part single part two-storey rear and side extension. ",
  "site_name": null,
  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - By reason of design, scale and location, the single, part two storey rear extension and first floor roof terrace would appear as unsympathetic and over dominant additions that would fail to relate subserviently to the host property to the harm of local spatial character. The development is therefore contrary to policies LP1 and LP5 of the Wandsworth Local Plan (2023) and Wandsworth Housing SPD (2016).",
    "Reason : 2 - By reason of design, scale and location, the single, part two storey rear extension and first floor roof terrace would be an unneighbourly form of development that would result in loss of daylight/sunlight, loss of outlook and and an increased sense of overbearing to the harm of neighbouring residential occupiers. The development is therefore contrary to policy LP2 of the Wandsworth Local Plan (2023) and Wandsworth Housing SPD (2016).",
    "Reason : 3 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
