    "Condition : 1 - This notice indicates that the proposed development would comply with Class A of Schedule 2 Part 1 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 2015 (as amended).  If you would like confirmation that the proposed development would be lawful, then you should submit an (optional) application to the local planning authority for a Lawful Development Certificate.\r\nIt is a requirement of condition A.4 (11) that the development shall be carried out in accordance with the details approved by the Local Planning Authority.\r\nThe materials used in any exterior work (other than materials used in the construction of a conservatory) must be of a similar appearance to those used in the construction of the exterior of the existing dwellinghouse.",
    "Condition : 2 - INFORMATIVE: You are reminded that this notice is issued on the basis of the physical circumstances prevailing at the property when the application was made.  If any other extension is undertaken BEFORE the construction of the extension, then this notice would no longer be applicable and planning permission may be required for the development presently proposed.\r\n",
    "Condition : 3 - INFORMATIVE: This notice is based on the drawings and any other information as submitted being a true reflection of the physical circumstances prevailing at the site on the date of the submission of the application. If the existing conditions are different from those shown on the drawings or if the drawings or any other information are inaccurate in any way, the notice may not be valid.\r\n",
    "Condition : 4 - INFORMATIVE: You are advised that this notice does not override your responsibilities under the Party Wall Act 1996.\r\n",
    "Reason : 1 - The proposal constitutes development under the Town and Country Planning Act 1990, and the local planning authority is not satisfied that, based on the drawings submitted as part of the application, this proposal falls within any class of 'permitted development' specified within Schedule 2 to the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).\r\n\r\nINFORMATIVE: The proposed development fails to comply with condition A.1 (i) of Class A, Part 1, Schedule 2 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended) as the eaves height of the flat roof portion of the extension would be located within 2metres of the curtilage boundary of the dwelllinghouse and exceed a height of 3m.\r\n"
