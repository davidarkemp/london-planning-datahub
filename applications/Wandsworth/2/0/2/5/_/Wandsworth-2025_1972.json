    "Condition : 1 - The proposal is to use one room within the existing flat as a home office, where the applicant will be taking phone calls only, related to a mini-cab service. The evidence submitted with the application shows there would be no taxis or visitors coming to the site. As such, it is considered that the proposal, as made under this application, would be incidental to the main use of the property therefore no material change of use would result. As there is no material change of use arising from the use of a room within the flat as a home office associated with a mini-cab telephone service use only (with no customers of visitors to the site), the proposal is not considered to represent 'development' for the purposes of interpreting the Act.\r\n\r\nOn the basis of the certificate applied for, the incidental use of a room within the application site as a home office for the purpose of taking phone calls only, would not constitute development as defined in Section 55 of the Act, therefore planning permission is not required for this proposal.\r\n"
