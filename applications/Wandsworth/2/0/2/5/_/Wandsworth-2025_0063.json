  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - By reason of its scale and design, the proposed extension over the back addition, with 85-degree sloped side elevation and a minimal set back from the side eaves, would appear overly bulky, to the detriment of the appearance of the host property and terrace. The proposed extension therefore fails to accord with policies LP1 and LP5 of the Wandsworth Local Plan (2023) and the guidance within the Housing SPD (2016).\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - By reason of its scale and design, the proposed extension over the back addition, with steeply sloped side elevation and a minimal set back from the side eaves, would represent an unneighbourly form of development that would appear overbearing, and result in loss of daylight and outlook for the first floor rear and side windows at the neighbouring property, 7 Bank Buildings, Mitcham Lane. The proposal therefore fails to accord with policy LP2 of the Wandsworth Local Plan (2023) and the guidance of the Wandsworth Housing SPD (2016).\r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably. In addition further guidance was offered to the applicant by the case officer during the processing of the application to identify amendments to address those elements of the scheme considered unacceptable. However, the necessary amendments to make the application acceptable are substantial and would materially change the development proposal. They would require further consultations to be undertaken prior to determination, which could not take place within the statutory determination period specified by the Department of Communities and Local Government. You are therefore encouraged to consider submission of a fresh application incorporating the material amendments set out below which are necessary to make the scheme acceptable. \r\n\r\nRequired amendments:\r\n- In accordance with the Housing SPD (2016) slope side elevation of extension over two-storey back addition at 70 degrees. The extension may start from the eaves of the existing roof.  \r\n- Reconfigure Flat 2 to one-bedroom flat to accord with policy LP27 and Nationally Described Space Standards (2015). \r\n",
