  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development, by reason of its scale, bulk and form, would be an unduly dominant addition that would fail to maintain subservience to the host property, detrimental to its appearance and setting, and would cause 'less than substantial' harm to  character and appearance of the Landford Road Conservation Area. The proposal therefore fails to comply with policies LP1, LP3 and LP5 of the Wandsworth Local Plan (2023) and the Housing SPD, as well as contravening Section 72 (1) of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 and the objectives of paragraphs 210 and 215 of the NPPF (2024).\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposex extension, by reason of its scale, bulk and form, would be an unneighbourly development, causing an unacceptable impact on the amenity of adjoining properties, including increased overshadowing, creating an increased sense of enclosure and being unduly overbearing. The proposal therefore fails to comply with policy LP2 of the Wandsworth Local Plan (2023), and the Housing SPD.\r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably. In addition further guidance was offered to the applicant by the case officer during the processing of the application to identify amendments to address those elements of the scheme considered unacceptable. However, the necessary amendments to make the application acceptable are substantial and would materially change the development proposal. They would require further consultations to be undertaken prior to determination, which could not take place within the statutory determination period specified by the Department of Communities and Local Government. You are therefore encouraged to consider submission of a fresh application incorporating the material amendments set out below which are necessary to make the scheme acceptable. \r\n\r\nRequired amendments:\r\nReduce the height and depth of the proposed rear extension.\r\n"
