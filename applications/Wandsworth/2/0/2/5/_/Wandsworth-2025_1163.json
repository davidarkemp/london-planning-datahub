Please also see following statement from tree owner with accompanying photograph: \"As you can see, the trunk is rotting and we think that there is a serious risk that the whole of the branch that branches off the main trunk will fall, it is directly above the path to our front door, where the previous piece of trunk fell, luckily whilst we were out. Additionally your team has expressed reservations about continuing to climb the tree for health and safety reasons, which is the other reason that we wanted the tree to be reduced in height.\"",
