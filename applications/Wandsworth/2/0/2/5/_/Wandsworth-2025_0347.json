    "Condition : 1 - The development hereby permitted shall be begun within 3 years from the date of this permission.\r\nReason: To prevent the accumulation of unimplemented planning permissions and to comply with Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended) and to meet the requirements of Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004 and to meet the requirements of The Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015.\r\n",
    "Condition : 2 - The development shall be carried out in accordance with the reports, specifications and drawings detailed [Location Plan; NWP-KIOSK/001; 217093-pln 1; PY4623-023-001 B; New Communication Kiosk Management Plan]. \r\nReason: To ensure a satisfactory standard of development and to allow the local planning authority to review any potential changes to the scheme. \r\n",
    "Condition : 3 - In the event that the communications hub scheme ceases or alters in a manner so as to leave this structure without function, then the structure shall be removed in its entirety and the land made good to the same condition as the adjacent land within 3 months of the cessation of the use of the structure.\r\nReason: To prevent the retention of redundant telecoms equipment in order to ensure no long term harm to the appearance, amenity and public safety of the location in accordance with Council Policy LP1 of the Wandsworth Local Plan (2023). ",
    "Condition : 4 - The proposed development shall be carried out in accordance with good arboricultural practice under BS5837:2012 and the communications kiosk shall be installed using shallow foundation option (ref.217093-pln 1max.250mm depth). All tree roots uncovered during excavation in preparation for the laying of foundations etc. which are in excess of 25mm in diameter shall be retained and foundations bridged round them or alternatively reported to\r\nthe Council's Tree Arboricultural Team within 48 hours in order that advice may be obtained with regard to adequate treatment. A directory of arboricultural specialists approved by the Arboricultural Association, with the relevant training, insurance and certification is available at: http://www.trees.org.uk or ring the Association on 01242 522152.\r\nReason: To preserve trees in the interests of visual amenity and the character of the area, in accordance with Council policy LP56 of the Local Plan (2023) coupled with the requirements of the National Planning Policy Framework 2024.",
    "Condition : 5 - Should the development granted under planning permission reference:2025/0347 be implemented and carried out, then planning permission ref.2024/2798 shall not be undertaken in any form. Should planning permission ref.2024/2798 be first implemented and carried out then planning permission ref.2025/0347 shall not be undertaken in any form.\r\nReason: To avoid unnecessary and excessive communication hubs in close proximity, in the interest of neighbour amenity and public safety of the location, in accordance with Council Policy LP1 and LP2 of the Wandsworth Local Plan (2023).\r\n",
    "Condition : 6 - INFORMATIVE: In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. The Council has made available detailed advice in the form of its statutory policies in the Local Plan (2023) as well as offering a full pre-application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably. In addition, where appropriate, further guidance was offered to the applicant during the processing of the application.",
    "Condition : 7 - INFORMATIVE: The footway and carriageway must not be blocked during the development. Temporary obstructions during the development must be kept to a minimum and should not encroach on the clear space needed to provide safe passage for pedestrians or obstruct the flow of traffic. All vehicles associated with the development must only park/stop at permitted locations and within the time periods permitted by existing on-street restrictions.\r\n"
