    "Condition : 1 - The development hereby permitted shall be begun within 3 years from the date of this permission.\r\nReason: To prevent the accumulation of unimplemented planning permissions and to comply with Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended) and to meet the requirements of Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004 and to meet the requirements of The Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015.\r\n",
    "Condition : 2 - The development shall be carried out in accordance with the reports, specifications and drawings detailed [B300008-3100 Rev. B]. \r\nReason: To ensure a satisfactory standard of development and to allow the local planning authority to review any potential changes to the scheme. \r\n",
    "Condition : 3 - All external materials used in the construction of the development hereby approved shall match the type, texture, tone, colour, size and profile of those used on the existing building and shall be retained permanently. \r\nReason: In the interest of the appearance of the development and to safeguard visual amenity, in accordance with Council policies LP1, P2 and LP5 of the Local Plan (2023) coupled with the requirements of the National Planning Policy Framework (20204). \r\n",

The window[s] shall so be maintained and retained as such. \r\nReason: To control overlooking and safeguard the privacy of neighbours in accordance with Council policy LP2 of the Wandsworth Local Plan (adopted August 2023) coupled with the requirements of the National Planning Policy Framework.\r\n",
    "Condition : 5 - INFORMATIVE: In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application.
