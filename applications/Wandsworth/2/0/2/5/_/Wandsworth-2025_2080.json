  "description": "TPO190/1998 -  T265 - Plane - Platanus x hispanica x1 \r\nThe home owner would like us to reduce beyond the previous pruning points if possible, though we understand looking at previous applications for this would be unlikely, so pruning to the previous points would also work. This work has been requested to improve light into rear garden, and house. As the rear of the house and garden are South facing a great deal of the natural light available is inhibited by the plane. In line with previous reductions this would be an ~5m reduction. Work on the South side of the tree would be carried out by Mewp within a single lane closure TM, and work on the North side would involve climbing due to lack of plant access - arisings will be chipped and removed. This work has been scoped by a trained and competent arborist.",
