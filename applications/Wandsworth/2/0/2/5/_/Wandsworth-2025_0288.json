    "Reason : 1 - The application, by reason of insufficient details provided relating to the side obscure glazed window; screening to terrace; refuse and recycling; and water efficiency fails to adequately meet the criteria for the discharge of conditions 4, 5, 6 and 8 of planning permission dated 19/06/2023 ref 2023/1549, failing to accord with the policies LP1, LP2 and LP10 of the Local Plan (2023).\r\n\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - INFORMATIVE: \r\n\r\nConditions 4: The applicant would benefit installing the whole window in obscure glazing for confirmation of compliance with a condition. \r\n\r\nCondition 5: The applicant would benefit by showing a physical measurement with a measuring tape or similar for confirmation of compliance with a condition.\r\n\r\nCondition 6: An alternative to the unventilated refuse storage cupboard is required. Potential for storage within the front garden area should be explored. \r\n\r\nCondition 8: Evidence including a completed water efficiency calculator for new dwellings demonstrating that the internal water consumption of the development will not exceed 105l/p/day must be submitted. \r\n"
