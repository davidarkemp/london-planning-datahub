  "description": "G1. Leyland Cypress x 4 Rear Garden/Extreme Rear Boundary. These four trees create perfect seclusion from neighbouring property but compromise natural daylight. As discussed with your partner, thining the branch structure would be a poor specification to carry out because the following issues would arise: The tree branches would become susceptible to wind blow being more open; the less dense canopy would also be very short-lived, therefore not achieving your goal of better light. I will suggest what I think would be practical and better in the long term to achieve your goals without too much compromise of screen loss. Reduce height by 3m to level, trim the front face and ends to square off and leave even. Ensure branches which grow into the Plum tree are cut back to provide a clearance of 3m, allowing the Plum tree to mature with better structure. The tree hedge current height is 12m, and the length of the hedge is 20m x depth is 3.5m. After the proposed works, the tree's height is 9m the length of the hedge is 18m x depth is 2.5m. T2. Silver Birch Rear Garden: Some fairly hard pruning was carried out in 2020/2021, and regrowth patterns indicate the tree is of reasonable health, I will suggest as follows to manage crown volume and maintain a sound structure. Reduce new growth back to previous points, approx height & crown spread reduction is 1.5m retaining suitable growth points for new crown development. Remove dead branches as applicable. The tree's current height is 16.5m and crown spread is 8.5m After the proposed works, the tree's height is 15m, and the crown spread is 7m.",
