    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development is not considered to be acceptable by reason of its design and siting above part of the two-storey back addition which would be highly visible from the public realm, causing 'less than substantial' harm to the character, appearance and significance of Wandsworth Town Conservation Area and would also compromise the visual amenity of adjoining sites through altering the level of privacy for neighbouring properties to an unacceptable degree.\r\n\r\nThere are no heritage benefits to outweigh this harm and therefore the proposal fails to satisfy the statutory duty of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990, the NPPF (2024), policy HC1(C) of the London Plan (2021), policies LP1, LP2, LP3 and LP5 of the Local Plan (2023), the Housing SPD (2016), the Historic Environment SPD (2016) and the Wandsworth Town Conservation Area Appraisal.\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
