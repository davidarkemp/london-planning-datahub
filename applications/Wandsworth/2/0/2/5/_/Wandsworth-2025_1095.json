    "Condition : 1 - The development hereby permitted shall be begun within 3 years from the date of this permission.\r\nReason: To prevent the accumulation of unimplemented planning permissions and to comply with Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended) and to meet the requirements of Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004 and to meet the requirements of The Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015.\r\n",
    "Condition : 2 - The development shall be carried out in accordance with the reports, specifications and drawings detailed A1.3 (Rev. A); A1.4 (Rev. A).\r\nReason: To ensure a satisfactory standard of development and to allow the local planning authority to review any potential changes to the scheme. \r\n",
    "Condition : 3 - All external materials used in the construction of the development hereby approved shall match the type, texture, tone, colour, size and profile of those used on the existing building and shall be retained permanently. \r\nReason: In the interest of the appearance of the development and to safeguard visual amenity of the conservation area, in accordance with Council policies LP1, LP2 and LP3 of the Local Plan coupled with the requirements of the National Planning Policy Framework.\r\n",
    "Condition : 4 - INFORMATIVE: In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. The Council has made available detailed advice in the form of its statutory policies in the Local Plan (2023) as well as offering a full pre-application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably. In addition, where appropriate, further guidance was offered to the applicant during the processing of the application.",
    "Condition : 5 - INFORMATIVE: West Hill supports numerous bus routes. In the event that implementation of the development impacts users of those services such as alighting or accessing bus stops or requires the temporary re-routeing of bus services or other such arrangements, these must be agreed with TfL before the work.\r\n\r\nWest Hill supports various bus routes. All vehicles associated with the development must only park / stop at permitted locations and within the time periods permitted by existing on-street restrictions.\r\n\r\nIt is vital that construction work associated with the development is carried out in accordance with best practice, minimising impact upon vulnerable road users including cyclists on surrounding streets. TfL strongly encourages the use of construction contractors who are registered on the Fleet Operator Recognition Scheme and adhere to the CLOCS standard. Contractor vehicles should include side-bars, blind spot mirrors and detection equipment to reduce the risk and impact of collisions with other road users and pedestrians on the capital�s roads.
