    "Reason : 1 - The proposed roof extensions, by reason of their siting, scale and design, would result in inappropriate and visually intrusive additions that would be harmful to the character and appearance of the host property and the setting of this part of the Wandsworth Common Conservation Area, with no public benefits to outweigh the identified harm, contrary to policies LP1, LP3 and LP5 of the Local Plan (2023), the provisions of paragraph 205 and 208 of the NPPF (2023) and the objectives of Section 72 (1) of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990.",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
