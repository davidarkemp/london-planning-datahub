    "Reason : 1 - The development would fail to provide an acceptable standard of accommodation for future occupiers, as one of the proposed flats would be located entirely at basement (lower ground floor) level with restricted outlook, resulting in an oppressive environment for future occupiers. The proposal would therefore fail to comply with policy LP27 of the Wandsworth Local Plan (2023) and policy D6 the London Plan (2021).",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
