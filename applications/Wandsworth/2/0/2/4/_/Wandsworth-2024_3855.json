  "description": "T4 (lime) of TPO/10/1994 - fell and replace with a new tree. The removal of the lime tree within the rear garden of 41 Albert Bridge Road (41ABR) is specified, given that its position in relation to the dwellinghouse of 39 Albert Bridge Road (39ABR) is considered to be unsustainable - this is confirmed by the Inspection Report that is submitted alongside this application (as technical evidence). Specifically, this is because its recorded stem position is less than c100mm away from the outer brick wall of 39ABR (that also constitutes the title boundary line); this is causing the internal wall of 39ABR to be routinely damp, due to the inability for this area to properly dry out. Moreover, as the tree stem radially grows over the future years, this separation will further reduce, which is considered to be unsustainable in itself (as a standalone matter) given that it is in almost all instances not suitable for the stem of a tree to grow up against the outer wall of a dwellinghouse for reasons associated with direct damage to the superstructure etc. There is an established precedent for this particular tree to be pruned by way of crown reduction (under at least planning permissions 2003/3055, 2015/3706, & 2017/5831), though the management of its crown is not sufficient to address and manage the problem with internal damp and proximity to the dwellinghouse???s outer wall that abuts 41ABR (and the position of this tree). For this reason, it is considered most appropriate for this tree to be removed and replaced within the rear garden of 41ABR (planted elsewhere within its rear garden). For clarity, the homeowners of 41ABR have agreed with the applicants of 39ABR that the removal of this tree is acceptable in principle, and that a replacement tree can be planted within the rear garden (of 41ABR) at a location further away from the dwellinghouse at 39ABR, in order to ensure that the site retains its verdant character for the long-term.
