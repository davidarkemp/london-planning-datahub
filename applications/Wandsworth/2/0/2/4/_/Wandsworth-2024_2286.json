    "Condition : 1 - This notice indicates that the proposed development would comply with Class A of Schedule 2 Part 1 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 2015 (as amended).  If you would like confirmation that the proposed development would be lawful, then you should submit an (optional) application to the local planning authority for a Lawful Development Certificate.\r\nIt is a requirement of condition A.3 that the development permitted by Class A shall be subject to the following conditions:\r\n(a) The materials used in any exterior work (other than materials used in the construction of a conservatory) must be of a similar appearance to those used in the construction of the exterior of the existing dwellinghouse.\r\n(b) Any upper-floor window located in a wall or roof slope forming a side elevation of the dwellinghouse must be obscure-glazed, and non-opening unless the parts of the window which can be opened are more than 1.7 metres above the floor of the room in which the window is installed.\r\n(c) Where the enlarged part of the dwellinghouse has more than a single storey or forms an upper storey on an existing enlargement of the original dwellinghouse, the roof pitch of the enlarged part must, so far as practicable, be the same as the roof pitch of the original dwellinghouse.\r\n",
    "Condition : 2 - INFORMATIVE: You are reminded that this notice is issued on the basis of the physical circumstances prevailing at the property when the application was made.  If any other extension is undertaken BEFORE the construction of the extension, then this notice would no longer be applicable and planning permission may be required for the development presently proposed.\r\n",
    "Condition : 3 - INFORMATIVE: You are advised that this notice does not override your responsibilities under the Party Wall Act 1996.\r\n",
    "Condition : 4 - INFORMATIVE: This notice is based on the drawings and any other information as submitted being a true reflection of the physical circumstances prevailing at the site on the date of the submission of the application. If the existing conditions are different from those shown on the drawings or if the drawings or any other information are inaccurate in any way, the notice may not be valid.\r\n"
