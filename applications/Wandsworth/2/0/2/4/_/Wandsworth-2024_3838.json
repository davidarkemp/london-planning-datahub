    "Reason : 1 - The proposal fails to demonstrate that at least 75% of the GIA of the proposed new flat would have a ceiling height of 2.3m or higher. The proposal would therefore fail to provide an acceptable standard of accommodation, and fails to comply with policy LP27 of the Wandsworth Local Plan, the London Plan (2021) and Nationally Described Space Standards (2015). \r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
