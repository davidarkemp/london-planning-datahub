    "Reason : 1 - Evidence has not been provided to indicate that the floor to ceiling height of the proposed additional storeys would be less than the lower of 3 metres; or the floor to ceiling height, measured internally, of any storey of the principal part of the existing building,  therefore failing to comply with Class AB.1.(d), Part 20, Schedule 2 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 2015 (GDPO) as amended.\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed development would be within 3 km of the perimeter of an aerodrome, which is used by aircraft engaged in the public transport of passengers and therefore would fail to comply with Class AB.1.(p)(vii), Part 20, Schedule 2 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 2015 (GDPO) as amended.\r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - INFORMATIVE: Please note if the proposal did not fail to comply with the GPDO in relation to the above, proposed flat 4 falls short of nationally described space standards, failing to comply with paragraph 9A of Part 3 of the Interpretation Section 2 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 2015 (GDPO) as amended. The proposal also fails to indicate the provision of cycle parking for the proposed new units, further contributing to the poor standard of accommodation provided, and failing to comply with policies LP27 and LP51 of the Wandsworth Local Plan (2023) and the London Plan (2021).",
    "Reason : 4 - INFORMATIVE: Please note if the proposal did not fail to comply with the GPDO in relation to the above, the proposed development by reason its appearance, design, scale and height would constitute a prominent, discordant and inappropriate form of development, which would appear overly dominant to the harm of the character and appearance of the host property and streetscene. As such, the proposal would have failed to comply with Class AB.2(1)(e), Part 20, Schedule 2 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 2015 (GDPO) as amended, in addition to the NPPF (2024), policy LP1 of the Wandsworth Local Plan (2023), and the guidance within the Housing SPD (2016). ",
    "Reason : 5 - INFORMATIVE: Please note if the proposal did not fail to comply with the GPDO in relation to the above, the proposal by reason its scale, design and siting would constitute an unneighbourly form of development, that would have a detrimental impact on the amenity of neighbouring properties in the form of an increased sense of overbearing. As such, the proposal would have failed to comply with Class AB.2(1)(g), Part 20, Schedule 2 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 2015 (GDPO) as amended, in addition to the NPPF (2021) and policy DMS1 of the Development Management Policies Document (2016) and the guidance within the Housing SPD (2016)."
