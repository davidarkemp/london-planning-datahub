    "Reason : 1 - The proposed roof extension, by reason of its location, scale and design results in an over dominant, highly prominent and incongruous extension that visually disrupts the existing roofscape to the harm of the character and appearance of the dwelling, the terrace it forms part of and the wider streetscene. Accordingly, the proposed development is contrary to policies LP1 and LP5 of the Wandsworth Local Plan (2023) and guidance within the Housing SPD (2016).",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan and Supplementary Planning documents as well as offering a full pre application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably. In addition further guidance was offered to the applicant by the case officer during the processing of the application to identify amendments to address those elements of the scheme considered unacceptable. \r\n\r\n"
