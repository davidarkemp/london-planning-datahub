  "description": "Alterations including erection of a hip to gable roof extension with rear dormer extension to main rear roof and over back addition; erection of single storey side and rear extensions.

  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - By reason of their design and size, the proposed hip to gable extension, rear roof dormer and single storey side/rear extension would appear bulky and overbearing and would negatively impact upon the appearance of the host property, its symmetry with its semi-detached pair and the surrounding street scene. Accordingly, the development is contrary to policies LP1 and LP5 of the Wandsworth Local Plan (2023) and the guidance within the Housing SPD (2016). \r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - By reason of its excessive height and depth, the proposed single storey extension would result in a loss of outlook and sense of overbearing for the neighbouring property.  Accordingly, the development is contrary to policy LP2 of the Wandsworth Local Plan (2023) and the Housing SPD (2016).\r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed conversion into a large HMO (sui generis) would result in the loss of a dwelling suitable for occupation by families as defined in Part A of Wandsworth Local Plan policy LP26, as the existing property is under 130sqm in GIA. Accordingly, the development is contrary to Part A.1 of policy LP29 of the Wandsworth Local Plan (2023).\r\n",
    "Reason : 4 - The site is located in an area with a moderate public transport accessibility level of 3 which falls short of a PTAL of at least 4 as required by Policy LP29 A.4. As the site location would not provide suitable access to good levels of public transport the proposed conversion into a large HMO (sui generis) would not be acceptable. Accordingly, the development is contrary to Part A.4 of policy LP29 of the Wandsworth Local Plan (2023).\r\n",
    "Reason : 5 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
