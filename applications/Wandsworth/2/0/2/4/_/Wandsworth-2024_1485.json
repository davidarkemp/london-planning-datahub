    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development, by reason of its design and layout, would fail to include the provision of at least one 3 bedroom flat with access to a 15sq.m garden, contrary to policies LP7 and LP26 of the Local Plan (2023).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed development, by reason of its scale, siting and design, would fail to be subservient and proportionate, would result in undue clutter and lack appropriate architectural response to the host property, thus failing to preserve the character and appearance of the property and wider area, including the significance of the Conservation Area.  As such, the proposal is considered contrary to the objectives of policies LP1, LP3, LP5 and LP6 of the Local Plan (2023) the as well as the statutory duty under section 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 and the guidance within the NPPF.",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed single storey extension, by reason of its design, scale and proximity next to no.34 Nightingale Lane would constitute an unneighbourly form of development that would harm the amenities of the neighbouring occupiers in the form of loss outlook through being overbearing and creating an increased and oppressive sense of enclosure. The proposal has also failed to demonstrate that there would not be unacceptable harm to neighbouring properties in respect to reductions in daylight and sunlight. The proposal is therefore considered to be contrary to policy LP2 of the Local Plan (2023).",
    "Reason : 4 - By reason of the size, layout and proposed level of occupancy, the two 3-bedroom flats (Flats 5 and 6) fail to meet minimum floor space requirements.  In addition, the occupiers of the two 1-bedroom basement flats (Flats 1 and 2) would have poor levels of outlook and the applicant has failed to demonstrate that an appropriate level of internal daylight and sunlight would be achieved to habitable rooms. Coupled with the lack of dedicated on-site external amenity spaces for all units, in particular neither of the proposed family-sized units (Flats 5 and 6), the proposed development would provide substandard residential accommodation. The proposal is therefore considered to be contrary to policy LP27 of the Local Plan (2023).",
    "Reason : 5 - In the absence of an Arboricultural Impact Assessment, the application has failed to demonstrate that the proposal would not result in harm to existing trees of amenity value. Accordingly the proposal is contrary to policies LP3 and LP56 of the Local Plan (2023).",
    "Reason : 6 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
