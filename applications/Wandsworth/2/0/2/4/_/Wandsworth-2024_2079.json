    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development by reason of its siting, scale and design would form a highly visible, over dominant, incongruous feature that would result in the loss of an opportunity for landscaping while relating poorly and being harmful to the character and appearance the Clapham Common Conservation Area and host property. The proposal would result in less than substantial harm that would not be outweighed by any public benefits. The proposal would therefore be contrary to the NPPF (2021), policies \r\nLP1, LP3, LP5 and LP6 of the Wandsworth Local Plan (2023) and the Housing SPD (2016).\r\n\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
