    "Reason : 1 - Due to the highways refusal of the relavant crossover, condiiton 9 cannot be discharged.\r\nThe proposal therefore fails to comply with policies LP1 and LP49 of the Local Plan (2023).\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal.",
    "Reason : 3 - INFORMATIVE: The applicant is advised that due to the refusal of the crossover, condition 9 cannot be discharged. The applicant is advised to first amend the scheme to remove the opening that is objected to, and to then apply to remove condition 9.\r\n"
