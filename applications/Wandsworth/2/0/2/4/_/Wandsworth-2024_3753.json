    "Reason : 1 - The proposal, by reason of scale, location and siting, would introduce an awkward addition in a prominent location which is considered to harm the character and appearance of the host property and surrounding area. The roof terrace would harm the appearance of the rear of the terrace on Lavenham Road.  The proposal would therefore not be in accordance with policies LP1 and LP5 of the Wandsworth Local Plan (2023); policies D3 of the London Plan (2021); and the Local Plan SPD 'Housing' (2016).\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
