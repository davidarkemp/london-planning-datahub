The stumps of trees T23 and T36 will be ground out and within two years replacement young lime trees will be planted in place of T23 and T36 as required for felled TPO trees,\r\nThe reasons for felling T36 are because the lower trunk was observed by a Management Company Director swaying noticeably in the storm so its anchor roots may be damaged like T23 that blew down, it has large areas of decay visible at the base (see photo in attachment B), there is a large old wound at about 3 m that has a large cavity with decay visible (see photo) which the tree surgeon advised is very likely hollow to the base, the tree trunk above the cavity was observed swaying to a significantly greater extent in the storm, and the tree's growth is heavily weighted towards the nearby building (see photo) ",
