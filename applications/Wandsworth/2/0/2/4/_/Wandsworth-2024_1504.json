  "description": "Eucalyptus Tree located at 10 Parkstead Road - Miss Fitzpatrick has already applied for works to the Eucalyptus trees located on her property whci has been approved. Application 2024/1256.  This same tree overhangs our back garden of 189 Dover House Road by approximately 7.5 metres. We would like to have this tree cut back to the boundary line. We are trying to coordinate with our neighbour so that the work can be coordinated by the same tree surgeon at the time he comes to do the planned works to Miss Fitzpatrick's tree. We hope that by doing this we will cause the least amount of damage to the tree.",
