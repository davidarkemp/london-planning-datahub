    "Reason : 1 - By reason of their excessive scale and design, the proposed extensions to the property at lower ground, upper ground, first floor and roof level would, in cumulation, fail to appear subservient to the host property and would overwhelm its existing proportions to an unacceptably harmful degree. The cumulative impact of the proposed roof extension and side extension together would also unacceptably exacerbate the host property's already anomalous appearance when compared with the surrounding properties, resulting in the property appearing over dominant, alien and incongruous within the streetscene which would be materially harmed due to failing to successfully integrate with the established local spatial character. The proposed extensions are therefore considered to be unacceptable and fails to comply with policies LP1 and LP5 of the Wandsworth Local Plan (2023), as well as the guidance of the Housing SPD (2016).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed excavation within the front garden would fail to retain at least 50% of the front garden depth for landscaping opportunities, and a positive pumped device is not indicated as being provided in the proposed extended basement. The proposed extension is considerd to be unacceptable in this regard and therefore fails to comply with policy LP6 of the Wandsworth Local Plan (2023).\r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed glazing and platform at the proposed raised level approx. 1.4m above rear garden level would result in the creation of perceived and actual opportunities for overlooking to the otherwise private adjacent amenity spaces, that would be materially increased over the existing situation to the harm of thier amenity. The proposed therefore fails to comply with policy LP2. \r\n",
    "Reason : 4 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
