    "Condition : 1 - The development hereby permitted shall be begun within 3 years from the date of this permission.\r\nReason: To prevent the accumulation of unimplemented planning permissions and to comply with Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended) and to meet the requirements of Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004 and to meet the requirements of The Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015.\r\n",
    "Condition : 2 - The development shall be carried out in accordance with the reports, specifications and drawings detailed P.01a; P.02a; P.03a; P.04a; P.05a; P.06a; P.07a.\r\nReason: To ensure a satisfactory standard of development and to allow the local planning authority to review any potential changes to the scheme. \r\n",
    "Condition : 3 - All external materials used in the construction of the development hereby approved shall match the type, texture, tone, colour, size and profile of those used on the existing building and shall be retained permanently. \r\nReason: In the interest of the appearance of the development and to safeguard visual amenity of the conservation area, in accordance with Council policies LP1, LP2 and LP3 of the Local Plan coupled with the requirements of the National Planning Policy Framework.\r\n",
    "Condition : 4 - The rooflights hereby approved, shall be of a conservation area specification i.e. in-line and flush within the roof pitch that they would be located.\r\nReason: In the interests of preserving the character and appearance of the conservation area in accordance with policy LP3 of the Local Plan and Section 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework.\r\n",
    "Condition : 5 - INFORMATIVE: In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. The Council has made available detailed advice in the form of its statutory policies in the Local Plan (2023) as well as offering a full pre-application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably. In addition, where appropriate, further guidance was offered to the applicant during the processing of the application.",
    "Reason : 1 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably. In addition further guidance was offered to the applicant by the case officer during the processing of the application to identify amendments to address those elements of the scheme considered unacceptable. However, the necessary amendments to make the application acceptable are substantial and would materially change the development proposal. They would require further consultations to be undertaken prior to determination, which could not take place within the statutory determination period specified by the Department of Communities and Local Government. You are therefore encouraged to consider submission of a fresh application incorporating the material amendments set out below which are necessary to make the scheme acceptable. \r\n\r\nRequired amendments:\r\nReduce the scale of the rear dormer.\r\nProvide details of the proposed replacement windows showing white hand-painted timber with integral glazing bars to match historic precedent on the Estate (ideally with top casement) and demonstrating the thickness of frame and glazing bars, including depth, and annotation confirming matching white-painted spacer bar to match external finish.\r\n\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The combined extensions would give a bulky, unbalanced appearance which would fail to maintain subservience to the host property. The proposed extensions would be considered visually overbearing and dominant in style and size and would result in harm to the character and appearance of the conservation area. For these reasons the proposal is not considered to meet the intent of policies LP1, LP3 and LP5 or the guidance in the Housing SPD. \r\n"
