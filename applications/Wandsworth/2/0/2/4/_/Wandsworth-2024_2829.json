    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development, by reason of its siting, scale, massing and bulk would be harmful to the character and appearance of this property and to the visual amenities of the surrounding area. The proposed roof terrace, would not be sufficiently setback from the rear of the back addition, and as such, in conjunction with the near full depth roof extension would appear over dominant and fail to integrate sympathetically with the appearance of the host property. The proposal fails to comply with policies LP1 and LP5 of the Wandsworth Local Plan (2023) and the guidance within the Housing SPD (2016).\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed extension over the back addition, by reason of its scale and siting would be an unneighbourly form of development that would have a detrimental impact on the amenity of neighbouring properties in the form of loss of daylight and sunlight. The proposal would therefore be contrary to policy LP2 of the Wandsworth Local Plan (2023) and the Housing SPD, 2016.\r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably. However, the necessary amendments to make the application acceptable are substantial and would materially change the development proposal. They would require further consultations to be undertaken prior to determination, which could not take place within the statutory determination period specified by the Department of Communities and Local Government. \r\n\r\n"
