  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed roof extension providing an additional storey on the single storey section of the host property would fail to respect the diminishing hierarchy of heights of the backland buildings to the rear of no 18 Kenilford Road and would fail to remain subservient to the surrounding built form resulting in an over dominent harmful intervention. The proposal therefore fails to comply with policies LP1 and LP5 of the Wandsworth Local Plan (2023). \r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed roof extension providing an additional storey would appear overbearing, oppressive and enclosing for the nearest residential properties along Dinsmore Road resulting in a harmful reduction to their outlook. The proposed single storey extension would also appear overbearing from within the rear gardens of these properties. The proposed first floor front windows would result in actual and percieved overlooking towards neighbouring properties, harming neighbouring privacy. The unacceptablility of the proposal in this respect, therefore fails to comply with policy LP2 of the Wandsworth Local Plan (2023) and the Housing SPD (2016). \r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
