T6. - Overhanging Ginkgo along the right-hand boundary - to cut back to the boundary (approx.1.5 metres) to give clearance to the roof. T7 - Magnolia / T8 - Cedar / T9 - Cypress / T10 - Cedar along the left-hand boundary - to lift the lower canopies to 3 metres, cutting back to give 1 metre clearance of the building and to also crown reduce the Magnolia by 1 metre. T11. - Bay tree adjacent to front gate ??? to lift the roadside canopy to 4-5 metres to comply with Highways Regulations and allow access underneath for high-sided vehicles.",
