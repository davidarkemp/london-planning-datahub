    "Reason : 1 - The roof extension, by reason of its scale, design and location forms a prominent, discordant and unsympathetic feature that fails to relate appropriately to the host building and local spatial character. The development is therefore contrary to policies LP1 and LP5 of the Wandsworth Local Plan (2023) and Housing SPD (2016). \r\n\r\n\r\nThe development would by reason ofï¿½.cause {identify harm and why}. \r\nThe proposal therefore fails to comply with policies [] and [] of the Development Management Policies Document (2016), and {SPD}..\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The roof extension, by reason of scale, design and siting, constitutes an unneighbourly form of development that has a particularly harmful impact on the amenity of the neighbouring occupiers at No.63 Vant Road in the form of being overbearing, creating an increased sense of enclosure and loss of daylight/sunlight. Therefore, the proposal would fail to comply with policy LP2 of the Wandsworth Local Plan (2023) and the Housing SPD (2016).",
    "Reason : 3 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
