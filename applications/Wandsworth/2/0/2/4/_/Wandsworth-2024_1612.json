    "Reason : 1 - The proposal constitutes development under the Town and Country Planning Act 1990, and the local planning authority is not satisfied that, based on the drawings submitted as part of the application, this proposal falls within any class of 'permitted development' specified within Schedule 2 to the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).\r\nINFORMATIVE: The proposed development fails to comply with condition A.1 (g), A.1 (h), A.1 (j) (iii) of Class A of Part 1, Schedule 2 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended) as the proposal does not meet the requirements of General Permitted Development Order due to the fact: \r\n- The extension would be 9.45m deep down the side return, which is greater than the maximum 6m depth set with B.1 (g). \r\n- The extension is full width to the rear and the requirement set by B.1 (j) (iii) which states that any side extension should be no more than 50% of the width of the building is breached. \r\n- The height of the eaves to the boundary with No 4 is also over the required 3m height set by B.1(i). \r\n- The extension would also be on a side elevation which faces onto a public highway failing to meet A.1 (e).\r\n"
