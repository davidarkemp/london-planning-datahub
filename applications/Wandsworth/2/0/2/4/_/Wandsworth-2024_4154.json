    "Reason : 1 - The proposed conservatory extension over the three-storey back addition, by reason of its design, scale and prominent location would constitute an unsympathetic and incongruous form of development that would fail to relate appropriately to the character and appearance of the host property or the terrace it forms part of. It would also result in harm to the setting of the adjacent Battersea Park Conservation Area. The proposal therefore fails to comply with policies LP1, LP3 and LP5 of the Wandsworth Local pan (2023) and the Housing SPD (2016). \r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
