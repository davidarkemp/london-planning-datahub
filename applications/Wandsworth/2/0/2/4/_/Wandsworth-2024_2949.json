    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development by reason of its scale, height, siting and design would result in an unneighbourly form of development to the residential occupiers located adjacent to the site along Ravenfield Road, as it would be unduly overbearing, create an increased sense of enclosure and lead to harmful loss of outlook. The proposal therefore fails to comply with policy LP2 of the Wandsworth Local Plan (2023). \r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably. In addition further guidance was offered to the applicant by the case officer during the processing of the application to identify amendments to address those elements of the scheme considered unacceptable. However, the necessary amendments to make the application acceptable are substantial and would materially change the development proposal. They would require further consultations to be undertaken prior to determination, which could not take place within the statutory determination period specified by the Department of Communities and Local Government. You are therefore encouraged to consider submission of a fresh application incorporating the material amendments set out below which are necessary to make the scheme acceptable. \r\n\r\nRequired amendments:\r\nRevert part of the development forming the east elevation (facing Ravenfield Road) to that granted planning permisison under (ref.2022/0183), including set back of mansard roof from parapet and roofslope angle; use of slate tiles for the roofing material to match that of the original. \r\n",
