    "Condition : 2 - The development shall be carried out in accordance with the reports, specifications and drawings detailed 197HR -PL -02 Rev.B, 197HR -PL -03 Rev.B, 197HR -PL -04 Rev.B, 197HR -PL -05 Rev.B, 197HR -PL -06 Rev.B, 197HR -PL -07 Rev.B, 197HR -PL -08 Rev.B, 197HR -PL -09 Rev.B. \r\nReason: To ensure a satisfactory standard of development and to allow the local planning authority to review any potential changes to the scheme. \r\n",

    "Condition : 4 - INFORMATIVE: In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application.
