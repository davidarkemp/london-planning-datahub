    "Condition : 1 - The development hereby permitted shall be begun within 3 years from the date of this permission.\r\nReason: To prevent the accumulation of unimplemented planning permissions and to comply with Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended) and to meet the requirements of Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004 and to meet the requirements of The Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015.\r\n",
    "Condition : 2 - The development shall be carried out in accordance with the reports, specifications and drawings detailed 001 REV A, 101 REV D, 103 REV C,  200 REV D, 201 REV D, 300 REV D, 301 REV D and Fire Safety Statement dated November 2024. \r\nReason: To ensure a satisfactory standard of development and to allow the local planning authority to review any potential changes to the scheme. \r\n",
    "Condition : 3 - All external materials used in the construction of the development hereby approved shall match the type, texture, tone, colour, size and profile of those used on the existing building and shall be retained permanently. \r\nReason: In the interest of the appearance of the development and to safeguard visual amenity, in accordance with Council policies LP1 and LP2 of the Local Plan coupled with the requirements of the National Planning Policy Framework.\r\n",
    "Condition : 4 - Notwithstanding the detail shown on the approved drawings, prior to commencement of use of the roof terrace as shown on drawing number 103 REV C details of screening to the balcony shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority.  The details submitted shall include measurements to ensure that screening shall be to a height of 1.7m above finished floor level and show the obscured glazing material(s) to be used.  The screening shall be completed in accordance with the approved details prior to commencement of the use of the terrace/ balcony and be so retained and maintained thereafter. \r\nReason: To protect the privacy of neighbours by preventing overlooking and in the interest of visual amenity in accordance with Council policies LP1, LP2 and LP27 of the coupled with the requirements of the National Planning Policy Framework.\r\n",
    "Condition : 5 - The Air Source Heat Pump shall not be used until a scheme is submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority which demonstrates that the following noise criteria can be complied with, and thereafter be retained and operated as approved. The cumulative measured or calculated rating level of noise emitted from the heat pump to which this application refers, shall be 5dB(A) below the existing background noise level at all times that it is in operation. The measured or calculated noise levels shall be determined at the boundary of the nearest ground floor noise sensitive premises or one metre from the faï¿½ade of the nearest first floor (or higher) noise sensitive premises, in accordance with the latest British Standard 4142. Reason: To prevent the operational noise of the heat pump having a detrimental effect on the amenity of neighbouring properties, in accordance with policies LP2 and LP14 of the Local Plan.",
    "Condition : 6 - The roof area of the development hereby permitted shall not be used as a balcony, roof garden or similar amenity area and furthermore, no balustrades, railings or other means of enclosure or means of permanent access shall be erected on this area.\r\nReason: To control overlooking and safeguard the privacy of neighbours in accordance with Council policies LP1 and LP2  of the Local Plan coupled with the requirements of the National Planning Policy Framework.\r\n",
    "Condition : 7 - INFORMATIVE: In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. The Council has made available detailed advice in the form of its statutory policies in the Local Plan (2023) as well as offering a full pre-application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably. In addition, where appropriate, further guidance was offered to the applicant during the processing of the application.",
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development by reason of its scale, design and location would result in an unneighbourly form of development that harms the amenity of the neighbouring occupiers in the form of loss outlook, being overbearing, creating an increased sense of enclosure. The proposal therefore fails to comply with policy LP2 of the Wandsworth Local Plan (2023) and the Wandsworth Housing SPD (2016).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed development, by reason of its scale, bulk and location would constitute a top heavy, bulky and intrusive form of development that would compete with and dominate the existing property causing unacceptable harm to the character and appearance of the terrace and wider area. The development would therefore fail to comply with policies LP1 and LP5 of the Wandsworth Local Plan (2023) and the Housing SPD (2016).",
    "Reason : 3 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably. In addition further guidance was offered to the applicant by the case officer during the processing of the application to identify amendments to address those elements of the scheme considered unacceptable. However, the necessary amendments to make the application acceptable are substantial and would materially change the development proposal. They would require further consultations to be undertaken prior to determination, which could not take place within the statutory determination period specified by the Department of Communities and Local Government. You are therefore encouraged to consider submission of a fresh application incorporating the material amendments set out below which are necessary to make the scheme acceptable. \r\n"
