  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - By reason of its scale, siting and design, the proposed development would be an overtly dominant and visually intrusive addition and would cause harm to the local spatial character and the setting of the Grade II Listed station building due to its prominence and visibility from Balham Station Road. In addition, the applicant has failed to demonstrate that the proposed development would not harm the historic fabric or structural integrity of the Grade II Listed Building. Therefore, the proposed development would fail to comply with the NPPF (2023), Section 66 (1) of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990, policy HC1 (C) of the London Plan (2021) and policies LP1, LP3 and LP5 of the Local Plan.",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan and Supplementary Planning documents, as well as offering a full pre application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably. However, the necessary amendments to make the application acceptable are substantial and would materially change the development proposal. They would require further consultations to be undertaken prior to determination, which could not take place within the statutory determination period specified by the Department of Communities and Local Government. You are therefore encouraged to consider submission of a fresh application incorporating the material amendments set out below which are necessary to make the scheme acceptable. \r\n\r\nRequired amendments:\r\n- The proposed scale and height of the extension should not extend above the roofline of the adjoining Balham Station building. \r\n- Additional detail should be provided on any attachment or impact to the historic fabric and structure of the adjoining Balham Station building, with sufficient evidence to ensure that the extension would not result in harm to any features of special architectural or historic significance of the Grade II Listed heritage asset."
