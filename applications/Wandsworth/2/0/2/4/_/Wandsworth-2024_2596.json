  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development, in particular the two-storey side extension and single storey rear/side extension, by reason of their design, scale and siting, would be unduly dominant additions that would fail to be subservient to, and relate poorly to, the host property, causing harm to the significance, character and appearance of this locally listed building, and to this part of the West Hill Road Conservation Area with no identifiable public benefits to outweigh the 'less than substantial' harm identified. The proposals are therefore contrary to the provisions of policies LP1, LP3 and LP5 of the Local Plan (2023); the Housing SPD (2016); the Historic Environment SPD (2016) and the West Hill Road Conservation Area Appraisal and Management Strategy, as well as the statutory duty of Section 72 (1) of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 and paragraphs 205 and 208 of the NPPF (2023).",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
