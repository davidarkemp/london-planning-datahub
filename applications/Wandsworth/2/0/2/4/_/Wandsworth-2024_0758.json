    "Reason : 1 - By reason of its scale, design and location, the two-storey rear extension would constitute an unsympathetic and incongruous form of development that would fail to relate appropriately to the character and appearance of the host property and wider terrace to the harm of local visual amenity. \r\nThe proposal therefore fails to comply with NPPF (2023), policies LP1 and LP5 of the Wandsworth Local Plan 2023 and the Housing SPD (2016). \r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
