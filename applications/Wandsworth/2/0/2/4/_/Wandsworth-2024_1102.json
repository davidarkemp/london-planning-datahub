In the event that a nest is found, an appropriate exclusion zone should be implemented around it until the young have fully fledged (Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 (as amended)). The law protects all wild bird species, their eggs and nests;\r\n2.\twhilst lighting should be avoided, if lighting is necessary, details of a construction lighting plan outlining how lighting will be prevented from negatively impacting any protected and priority species during construction, in particular commuting bats, or adjacent habitats.

    "Condition : 7 - INFORMATIVE: In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application.
