    "Reason : 1 - The proposal constitutes development under the Town and Country Planning Act 1990, and the local planning authority is not satisfied that, based on the drawings submitted as part of the application, the single-storey extension proposal falls within any class of 'permitted development' specified within Schedule 2 to the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).\r\n\r\nINFORMATIVE: The proposed single-storey rear extension would fail to meet the requirements of Schedule 2, Part 1, Class A.1 (ja), as the total enlargement (being the enlarged part together with the existing single-storey side/rear extension to which it will be joined) would exceed the limits set out in sub-paragraph (j)(iii), being that the enlarged part of the dwellinghouse would extend beyond a wall forming a side elevation of the original dwellinghouse, and would have a width greater than half the width of the original dwellinghouse. \r\n\r\n\r\n"
