    "Reason : 1 - The proposed roof dormers would fail to be subservient and proportionate to the host property and would lack appropriate architectural response to the host property, and the proposed rooflights would be excessive in number and would clutter the front roof slope. The proposal thus fails to preserve its contribution to the character and appearance of the area, including the significance of the Conservation Area.  Commensurately, this would harm the setting and thus significance of the listed terrace, 81-96 Nightingale Lane. The proposal would result in less than substantial harm to the conservation area and the level of harm would not be outweighed by any public benefits. The proposal would therefore fail to accord with Local Plan Policies LP1, LP3 and LP5, as well as the statutory duty under section 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 and the guidance within the NPPF.\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably. In addition further guidance was offered to the applicant by the case officer during the processing of the application to identify amendments to address those elements of the scheme considered unacceptable. However, the necessary amendments to make the application acceptable are substantial and would materially change the development proposal. They would require further consultations to be undertaken prior to determination, which could not take place within the statutory determination period specified by the Department of Communities and Local Government. \r\n"
