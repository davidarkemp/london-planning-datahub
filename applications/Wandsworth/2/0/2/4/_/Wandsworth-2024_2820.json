    "Reason : 1 - The proposed bin stores and cycle stores would result in visible, incongruous sheds that would provide pockets of potential antisocial behaviour and missed opportunity for improved urban greening and public realm. The proposal would be out of character and would have an adverse impact on the streetscene, contrary to Local Plan Policy LP1, Wandsworth Refuse and Recyclables SPD and London Plan Policies D3 and D8. \r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed main bin store would be visually intrusive with an overbearing impact and a sense of enclosure to the ground-floor windows of No. 30 Point Pleasant, and it could have an impact on the health of occupiers and users of Nos. 22 to 30 Point Pleasant due to potential odour and vermin. Additionally, the bins and cycle stores would compromise the visual amenity of rear facing units in Nos. 22-26, No.30 Point Pleasant and Nos. 32-40 Osiers Way. This would be contrary to LP2, LP51 and Wandsworth Refuse and Recyclables SPD. ",
    "Reason : 3 - The application did not clarify impact to the loss of car parking onto existing and future users of the building and the proposed cycle store would not be accessible or well-located to Riverside House, contrary to Policy LP51. ",
    "Reason : 4 - The application did not include fire safety strategy for the bins considering their proximity to adjoining sites, contrary to London Plan Policy D12. ",
    "Reason : 5 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
