  "description": "TPO no. 479 T1  Fell cherry tree to rear of 22 Amner Road. This tree is growing within approximately 3m of the rear of the subject property. This tree has outgrown its location within a small rear garden, its canopy oversails and touches the roof of the two-storey residential property. The canopy hangs low over the highway. Its' canopy has been managed by crown reduction works and prior to this the tree had the trunk reduced to approximately 4m. The canopy is formed by co-dominant branches that grow from this reduction point. There is a cavity within this old union which is considered to be a potential point of failure. Heavily pruning mature cherry trees is not good arboricultural practice, pruning will not serve to significantly reduce the risk of structural failure but will serve to reduce the already limited remaining life-expectancy of this tree. This mature cherry tree is growing on the flank boundary of the rear garden pushing against the boundary fence which runs along the pavement of Manchuria Road. The roots of this tree are disrupting the pavement and the hardstanding within the rear garden of the subject property. It is not a character of the wider residential area to have relatively large trees growing within the rear gardens of the corner properties. The houses fronting onto Manchuria Road all have front gardens with small shrubs and managed hedges with street trees predominately Sorbus growing within the pavement. I would estimate that this tree is approximately 60-80 years old and it should be noted that until very recently it was not protected by a TPO, it is unclear why it was decided to serve a TPO, and what amenity assessment was utilised by 'Enable Leisure and Culture' to decide if the tree merited a TPO. I do not consider that the amenity value of this tree is sufficient to either justify a TPO or outweigh the negative impact on the residents of 22 Amner Road. It is my opinion that removal and replacement planting of a suitable tree in a well p",
