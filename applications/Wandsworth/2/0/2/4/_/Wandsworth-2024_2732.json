  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed conversion into a large HMO (sui generis) would result in the loss of a dwelling suitable for occupation by families as defined in Part A of \r\nWandsworth Local Plan policy LP26, as the property was under 130sqm in GIA, as originally constructed. Accordingly, the proposal would result in harm to housing choice in the borough and is contrary to Part A.1 of policy LP29 of the Wandsworth Local Plan (2023).\r",
    "Reason : 2 - The site is located in an area with a low public transport accessibility level \r\nof 2 which falls short of a PTAL of at least 4 as required by Policy LP29 A.4. As the site location would not provide suitable access to good levels of public transport the proposed conversion into a large HMO (sui generis) would not be acceptable. Accordingly, the development is contrary to Part A.4 of policy LP29 of the Wandsworth Local Plan (2023).\r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposal fails to provide sufficient information to demonstrate that the development would meet the Nationally Described Space Standards requirements in terms of internal floor to ceiling heights and that adequate outlook to bedroom 5 for future occupiers would be achieved. The proposal therefore fails to demonstrate a satisfactory standard accommodation and does not comply with policies LP27 and LP29 A.5 of the Wandsworth Local Plan (2023), and Nationally Described Space Standards (2015).\r\n",
    "Reason : 4 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal.",
    "Reason : 5 - INFORMATIVE: Please be advised that the proposal also fails to demonstrate accordance with Minimum Amenities Standards for Houses in Multiple Occupation (2020), which state that, where no separate living room is provided that is not a kitchen or combined kitchen/dining room, bedrooms for two occupiers are required to be 15sqm or bigger, and that attic rooms' ceiling heights must be at least 2.14m over 75% of their floor area - not including the parts of the floor area where ceiling height is less than 1.5m. \r\n"
