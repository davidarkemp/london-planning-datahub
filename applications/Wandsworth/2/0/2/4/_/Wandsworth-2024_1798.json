    "Reason : 1 - The proposed house by reason of its residential use and location within the Summerstown Locally Significant Industrial Area (LSIA) and proximity to existing commercial uses would prejudice the ongoing operation and intensification of the industrial uses woth the LSIA contrary to Local Plan (2023) policy LP34 and London Plan (2021) policy D13.  ",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed house by reason of its design, height, massing and closure of an important gap would result in a visually intrusive and overbearing form of development resulting in an unacceptable impact upon the prevailing local character whilst resulting in less than substantial harm to the appearance of the locally listed buildings at 6 and 8 Summerstown and the Corner Pin public house without adequate public benefits to outweigh this harm. The proposal would be contrary to Local Plan (2023) policies LP2 & LP3 and paragraph 208 of the NPPF (2023).",
    "Reason : 3 - In the absence of an adequate flood risk assessment and sequential test, the applicant has failed to demonstrate that the development would not increase the risk of flooding contrary to Local Plan (2023) policy LP12 and the NPPF (2023)",
    "Reason : 4 - The proposed house by reason of its size and location would result in the development of an existing residential side garden contrary to part E of Local Plan (2023) policy LP7 ",
    "Reason : 5 - INFORMATIVE: In the absence of an adequate and accurate BNG report, the proposal fails to demonstrate achievement of a 10% uptake in biodiversity in line with the criteria set out in Biodiversity Net Gain under Schedule 7A of the Town and Country Planning Act (1990) (as inserted by Schedule 14 of the Environment Act (2021))",
    "Reason : 6 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
