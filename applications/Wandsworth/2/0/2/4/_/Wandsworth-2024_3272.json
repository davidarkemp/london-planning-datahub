    "Reason : 1 - The proposed side extension by reason of its discordant and boxy design to the side and high degree of visibility the street would result in an unacceptable and incongruous design element in contravention of policies LP1 and LP5 of the Local Plan (2023)",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed extension, by way of its excessive size and inappropriate placement, would obstruct daylight to neighbouring properties, harming their amenity in contravention of Local Plan Policy LP2.",
    "Reason : 3 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
