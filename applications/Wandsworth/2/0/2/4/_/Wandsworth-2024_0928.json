    "Condition : 1 - The development hereby permitted shall be begun within 3 years from the date of this permission.\r\nReason: To prevent the accumulation of unimplemented planning permissions and to comply with Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended) and to meet the requirements of Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004 and to meet the requirements of The Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015.\r\n",
    "Condition : 2 - The development shall be carried out in accordance with the reports, specifications and drawings detailed in LOC001, 100, 102 Rev. A, Door Specification Document by LDC, Window Quotation by Wandsworth Sash Windows, Fire Safety Statement.\r\nReason: To ensure a satisfactory standard of development and to allow the local planning authority to review any potential changes to the scheme. \r\n",
    "Condition : 3 - All external materials used in the construction of the development hereby approved shall match the type, texture, tone, colour, size and profile of those used on the existing building and shall be retained permanently. The bricks for the infilling of the door should match the existing and the brickwork should be built in a matching bond using lime mortar. The pointing should be flush and rag-finished to give a traditional appearance. Any repointing should be done in lime with a flush rag-finished joint. Any existing pointing should be raked out by hand to avoid damage to the brickwork. Any required cleaning to the existing brickwork should be done using the DOFF method of pressure steam-cleaning and should not use any aggregates, which damage the surface of the brick. \r\nReason: In the interest of the appearance of the development and to safeguard visual amenity, in accordance with Council policies LP1, LP3 and LP5 of the Local Plan coupled with the requirements of the National Planning Policy Framework.\r\n",
    "Condition : 4 - INFORMATIVE: In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. The Council has made available detailed advice in the form of its statutory policies in the Local Plan (2023) as well as offering a full pre-application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably. In addition, where appropriate, further guidance was offered to the applicant during the processing of the application."
