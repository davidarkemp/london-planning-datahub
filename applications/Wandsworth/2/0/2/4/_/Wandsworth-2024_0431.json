    "Reason : 1 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal.",
    "Reason : 2 - By reason of their scale, design and location, the proposed single storey extension  would constitute an unsympathetic and incongruous form of development that would compete with and dominate the existing property causing unacceptable harm to the character and appearance of the terrace and wider area. The development would therefore fail to comply with policies LP1 and LP5 of the Wandsworth Local Plan (2023) and the Housing SPD (2016). \r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed single storey and two-storey rear extensions by reason of their scale, design and siting constitutes an unneighbourly form of development that harms the amenity of the neighbouring property in the form of loss outlook, being overbearing and creating an increased sense of enclosure. The application has also failed to demonstrate that there would not be unacceptable harm to neighbouring windows in respect to reductions in daylight. The development is therefore contrary to policy LP2 of the Wandsworth Local Plan (2023) and the Housing SPD (2016). \r\n"
