    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development, by reason of the siting of the solar panels on the front roof slope, would result in a visually prominent addition which would detract from the character, appearance and significance of the host property and the terrace and street scene within this part of the Oxford Road Conservation Area. There are no identifiable public benefits that outweigh the 'less than substantial' harm identified and the proposal therefore fails to satisfy policies LP1, LP3 and LP5 of the Local Plan (2023); the Housing SPD (2016); the Historic Environment SPD (2016) and the objectives of the Oxford Road Conservation Area Appraisal and Management Strategy, as well as the statutory duty of Section 72 (1) of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 and paragraphs 212 and 215 of the NPPF (2024).",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
