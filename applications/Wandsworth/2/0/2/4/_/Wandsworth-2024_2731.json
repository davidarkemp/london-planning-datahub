  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed extension of the first floor of the back addition, the detailed design of the gable roof extension and inclusion of railings to the front lightwell, by reason of size, siting and design, would be a prominent, visually intrusive and unsympathetic form of development that would harm the appearance of the host property, disrupt the line of the back additions along this section of Wakehurst Road, and harm the appearance of the street scene. The proposals are therefore contrary to policies LP1 and LP5 of the Wandsworth Local Plan (2023) and the guidance within the Housing SPD (2016).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed single-storey side/rear extension and two to three-storey extension of the back addition, constitute an unneighbourly form of development that harms the amenity of the neighbouring residential occupiers in the form of loss outlook, being overbearing and creating an increased sense of enclosure. The application has also failed to demonstrate that there would not be unacceptable harm to neighbouring windows in respect to reductions in daylight. The extensive window proposed at first floor to the rear of the back addition would also result in an unacceptable level of overlooking and loss of privacy to the properties and gardens to the rear. The development is therefore contrary to policy LP2 of the Wandsworth Local Plan (2023) and the Housing SPD (2016).\r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably. In addition further guidance was offered to the applicant by the case officer during the processing of the application to identify amendments to address those elements of the scheme considered unacceptable. However, the necessary amendments to make the application acceptable are substantial and would materially change the development proposal. They would require further consultations to be undertaken prior to determination, which could not take place within the statutory determination period specified by the Department of Communities and Local Government. \r\n"
