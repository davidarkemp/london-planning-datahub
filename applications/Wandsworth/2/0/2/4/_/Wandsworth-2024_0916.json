    "Reason : 1 - The form and siting of the proposed amendments to the roof design of the approved building would unduly increase its visual prominence within the streetscene, causing less than substantial harm to the character and appearance of this part of the Roehampton Village conservation area by diminishing the appearance of the site as a garden setting. There are not considered to be any public benefits to the scheme that outweigh the identified harm, particularly when taking into account the consented fall-back scheme. The proposed development would therefore be contrary to Local Plan policies LP1, LP2 and LP3, London Plan Policy HC1, the objectives of NPPF paragraphs 190-196 and Section 72(1) of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990.",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
