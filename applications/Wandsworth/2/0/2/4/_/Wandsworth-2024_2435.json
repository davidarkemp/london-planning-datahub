    "Reason : 1 - The hot food takeaway (sui generis) would be located within 400m of a school. The proposal would therefore be contrary to the principles, including the healthy eating initiatives, identified within the NPPF (2023), policy E9(D) of the London Plan (2021), policy LP15(B) of the Wandsworth Local Plan (2023) and the Town Centre Uses SPD (2015). ",
    "Reason : 2 - The kiosk, by reason of its siting and design, is a prominent, visually intrusive and unsympathetic development that harms the appearance of the streetscene. The proposal is therefore contrary to policy LP1 of the Wandsworth Local Plan (2023). ",
    "Reason : 3 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
