    "Reason : 1 - Condition 4 pursuant to planning permission ref.2024/0021 relates to BREEAM Domestic Refurbishment, which seeks to incorporate sustainability through the refurbishment of existing buildings. The condition is considered necessary, relevant to planning and to the development to be permitted, enforceable, precise and reasonable. Therefore, in the absence of any compelling evidence which clearly illustrates that 'Outstanding' or other BREEAM Pre-Assessment Domestic Refurbishment target is not technically feasible, the proposal is considered contrary to the NPPF (2023) and policy LP10 of the Local Plan (2023).  ",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
