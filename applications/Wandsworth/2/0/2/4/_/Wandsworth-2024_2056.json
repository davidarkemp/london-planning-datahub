    "Condition : 43 - INFORMATIVE: Thames Water advise that the proposal should incorporate flood protection measures, for example non-return valve (or other suitable device), to avoid the risk of sewer backflow at a later date, on the assumption that the sewerage network may surcharge to ground level during storm conditions. ",
    "Condition : 44 - INFORMATIVE: There are public sewers crossing or close to your development. In order to protect public sewers and to ensure that Thames Water can gain access to those sewers for future repair and maintenance, approval should be sought from Thames Water where the erection of a building or an extension to a building or underpinning work would be over the line of, or would come within 3 metres of, a public sewer. Thames Water will usually refuse such approval in respect of the construction of new buildings, but approval may be granted in some cases for extensions to existing buildings. The applicant is advised to contact Thames Water Developer Services on 0800 009 3921 to discuss the options available at this site.",
    "Condition : 45 - INFORMATIVE: With regard to surface water drainage it is the responsibility of a developer to make proper provision for drainage to ground, water courses or a suitable sewer. In respect of surface water it is recommended that the applicant should ensure that storm flows are attenuated or regulated into the receiving public network through on or off site storage. When it is proposed to connect to a combined public sewer, the site drainage should be separate and combined at the final manhole nearest the boundary. Connections are not permitted for the removal of groundwater. Where the developer proposes to discharge to a public sewer, prior approval from Thames Water Developer Services will be required to ensure that the surface water discharge from the site shall not be detrimental to the existing sewerage system. They can be contacted on 0800 009 3921. ",
    "Condition : 46 - NFORMATIVE: Note - the below information is related to Low and Medium Pressure Assets. You may be contacted separately by our engineers regarding High/Intermediate Pressure Pipelines.\r\nConsiderations in relation to gas pipeline/s identified on site:\r\nCadent have identified operational gas apparatus within the application site boundary. This may include a legal interest (easements or wayleaves) in the land which restricts activity in proximity to Cadent assets in private land.\r\nThe Applicant must ensure that proposed works do not infringe on Cadent�s legal rights and any details of such restrictions should be obtained from the landowner in the first instance.\r\nIf buildings or structures are proposed directly above the gas apparatus then development should only take place following a diversion of this apparatus. The Applicant should contact Cadent�s Plant Protection Team at the earliest\r\nopportunity to discuss proposed diversions of apparatus to avoid any unnecessary delays.\r\nIf any construction traffic is likely to cross a Cadent pipeline then the Applicant must contact Cadent�s Plant Protection Team to see if any protection measures are required.\r\nAll developers are required to contact Cadent�s Plant Protection Team for approval before carrying out any works on site and ensuring requirements are adhered to.\r\nEmail: plantprotection@cadentgas.com Tel: 0800 688 588.",
