    "Reason : 1 - The proposed south extension would have an overbearing impact and would be visually intrusive to flats on the southwest corner of No.1 Eastfields Avenue and could have an impact on their daylight and sunlight levels contrary to LP2 of the Wandsworth Local Plan 2023-2038.",
    "Reason : 2 - The application did not demonstrate the impact on the west extension on space provision or manoeuvring of vehicles within the car parking area, and it did not demonstrate the impact of the south extension onto the operation of the existing car park entrance, contrary to Policy LP2 and LP51 of the Wandsworth Local Plan 2023-2038.\r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably. In addition further guidance was offered to the applicant by the case officer during the processing of the application to identify amendments to address those elements of the scheme considered unacceptable. However, the necessary amendments to make the application acceptable are substantial and would materially change the development proposal. They would require further consultations to be undertaken prior to determination, which could not take place within the statutory determination period specified by the Department of Communities and Local Government. You are therefore encouraged to consider submission of a fresh application incorporating the material amendments set out below which are necessary to make the scheme acceptable. \r\n\r\nRequired amendments:\r\n************************************************************\r\n"
