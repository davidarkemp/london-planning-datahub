    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development by reason of its siting and alteration to the front garden and front boundary of the site would cause harm to visual amenity, to the character, appearance, significance and setting of the house and the streetscape, and to the significance of this part of the Dover House Estate Conservation Area, with no public benefits to outweigh the identified harm, contrary to policies LP1, LP3 and LP5 of the Wandsworth Local Plan (adopted 2023); policy HC1(C) of the London Plan (2021); the Dover House Estate Conservation Area Appraisal and Management Strategy, paragraphs 205 and 208 of the NPPF (2023) and the objectives of Section 72 (1) of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990.",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
