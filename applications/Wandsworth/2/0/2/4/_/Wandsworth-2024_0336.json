    "Reason : 1 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal.",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed rear extension, existing lower ground floor extension and rear garden access collectively would result in an overdevelopment of the property that would appear visually intrusive and out of character with the surrounding area. The proposal would cause undue harm to the amenity of surrounding residential occupiers in terms of being overbearing, overshadowing and privacy. The proposal therefore fails to comply with policies LP1, LP2 and LP5 of the Wandsworth Local Plan (2023), and the Housing SPD.\r\n"
