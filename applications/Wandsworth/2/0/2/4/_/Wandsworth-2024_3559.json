  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed conversion of the property into 1 x one bedroom and 1 x three-bedroom units fails to provide at least one family-sized dwelling with direct access to a dedicated rear garden of at least 15sqm. The proposal therefore fails to comply with policy LP26 of the Wandsworth Local Plan (2023), \r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed roof terraces, due to their scale, design and location, would be prominent, visually intrusive and discordant features that would fail to relate appropriately to the host building and local spatial character. The proposal therefore fails to comply with policies LP1 and LP5 of the Wandsworth Local Plan (2023), and the Wandsworth Housing SPD (2016).\r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed single storey rear extension, by reason of its scale, design and location, would harm outlook and would appear overbearing for the neighbouring property. The proposed roof terraces, due to their siting, design and location, would be an unneighbourly form of development that would result in a loss of privacy, increase in noise and disturbance, and a sense of overbearing for the residents of the neighbouring properties. The proposal therefore fails to accord with policy LP2 of the Wandsworth Local Plan (2023) and the guidance of the Wandsworth Housing SPD (2016).",
    "Reason : 4 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
