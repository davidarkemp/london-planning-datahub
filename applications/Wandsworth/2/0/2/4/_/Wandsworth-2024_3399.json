    "Reason : 1 - By reason of their design, scale and location, the proposed roof extensions would appear overly large, top heavy and would fail to relate sympathetically to the character and appearance of the host property and it neighbours to the harm of local visual amenity.  Furthermore, the proposal would constitute an unneighbourly form of development, appearing overbearing to the harm of neighbouring occupiers.  Accordingly, the development is contrary to policies LP1, LP2, LP5 and of the Wandsworth Local Plan (2023) and the Housing SPD (2016).",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
