As combined with the  existing rear extension the proposed development would have a width greater than half width of the original dwellinghouse and extend beyond the rear wall by 9.5 meters. \r\n\r\nINFORMATIVE: The proposed development fails to comply with  (f), (j) or (ja) of Class A of Part 1, Schedule 2 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended) as as combined with the  existing rear extension the proposed development would extend beyond a side elevation and have a width greater than half width of the original dwellinghouse and extend beyond the rear wall by 9.5 meters. \r\n"
