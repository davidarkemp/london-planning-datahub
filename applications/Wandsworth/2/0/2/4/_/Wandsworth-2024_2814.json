    "Condition : 19 - NFORMATIVE: The applicant is advised that the effect of paragraph 13 of Schedule 7A to the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 is that planning permission granted for the development of land in England is deemed to have been granted subject to the condition \"(the biodiversity gain condition\") that development may not begin unless: a) a Biodiversity Gain Plan has been submitted to the local planning authority, and; b) the local planning authority has approved the plan.  There are statutory exemptions and transitional arrangements which mean that the biodiversity gain condition does not always apply.  Based on the information available this permission is considered to be one which will require the approval of a Biodiversity Gain Plan before development is begun because none of the statutory exemptions or transitional arrangements are considered to apply.  \r\n"
