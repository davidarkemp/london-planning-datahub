    "Reason : 1 - By reason of its scale and design, the proposed extension over the back addition, with vertical rear and side elevations and a minimal set back from the side eaves, would appear overly bulky, to the detriment of the appearance of the host property and terrace. The proposed extension therefore fails to accord with policies LP1 and LP5 of the Wandsworth Local Plan (2023) and the guidance within the Housing SPD (2016). \r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - By reason of its scale and design, the proposed extension over the back addition, extending 85% of the depth of the back addition with vertical rear and side elevations and a minimal set back from the side eaves, would represent an unneighbourly form of developemnt that would appear overbearing, and result in loss of daylight and outlook for the first floor rear and side windows at the neighbouring property, 7 Bank Buildings, Mitcham Lane. The proposal therefore fails to accord with policy LP2 of the Wandsworth Local Plan (2023) and the guidance of the Wandsworth Housing SPD (2016).",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed development, by reason of its layout and design, fails provide appropriate levels of outlook for future occupiers, as all but one of the proposed bedrooms would only be served by obscure glazed windows. The proposed scheme therefore fails to achieve a suitable degree of compliance with policy LP27 of the Wandsworth Local Plan (2023), and the London Plan (2021).\r\n",
    "Reason : 4 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
