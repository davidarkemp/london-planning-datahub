    "Reason : 1 - The use of the building by customers of the restaurant would by reason of its scale, design and location result in adverse levels of noise and disturbance that would have a harmful impact on the amenity of the neighbouring residential occupiers. Furthermore, it would also constitute an unneighbourly form of development through actual and perceived overlooking and loss of privacy to neighbouring properties. The proposal would therefore be contrary to policy D14 of the London Plan (2021) and policies LP2, LP14 and LP45 of the Wandsworth Local Plan (2023)\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The restaurant outbuilding by reason of it is disconnect to the main restaurant along with its appearance, scale and siting represents a poor standard of development that is a visually incongruous and out of keeping with the prevailing residential character of Glasford Street. The building therefore fails to comply with policy LP1 of the Wandsworth Local Plan (2023). ",
    "Reason : 3 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
