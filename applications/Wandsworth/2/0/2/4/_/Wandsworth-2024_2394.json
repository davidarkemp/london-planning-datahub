    "Condition : 1 - The development hereby permitted shall be begun within 3 years from the date of this permission.\r\nReason: To prevent the accumulation of unimplemented planning permissions and to comply with Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended) and to meet the requirements of Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004 and to meet the requirements of The Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015.\r\n",
    "Condition : 2 - The development shall be carried out in accordance with the reports, specifications and drawings detailed [Planning Details Shopfront rev. A; Planning Details Compressors rev. C; Proposed Plan Option 3 rev. F]. \r\nReason: To ensure a satisfactory standard of development and to allow the local planning authority to review any potential changes to the scheme. \r\n",
    "Condition : 3 - The external refrigeration and air-conditioning plant and equipment shall not become operational until a scheme is submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority which demonstrates that the following noise criteria can be complied with, and thereafter be retained and operated as approved. \r\n\r\nThe cumulative measured or calculated rating level of noise emitted from the external refrigeration and air-conditioning plant and equipment to which this application refers, shall be 10dB(A) below the existing background noise level at all times that it is in operation. The measured or calculated noise levels shall be determined at the boundary of the nearest ground floor noise sensitive premises or one metre from the fa�ade of the nearest first floor (or higher) noise sensitive premises, in accordance with the latest British Standard 4142.\r\n\r\nThe external refrigeration and air-conditioning plant and equipment plant shall be supported on adequate proprietary anti-vibration mounts as necessary to prevent the structural transmission of vibration and regenerated noise within adjacent or adjoining premises, and these shall be so maintained thereafter.\r\nReason: To protect the amenities of neighbouring occupiers, in accordance with policies LP1 and LP2 and LP14 of the Local Plan.",
    "Condition : 4 - INFORMATIVE: In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. The Council has made available detailed advice in the form of its statutory policies in the Local Plan (2023) as well as offering a full pre-application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably. In addition, where appropriate, further guidance was offered to the applicant during the processing of the application."
