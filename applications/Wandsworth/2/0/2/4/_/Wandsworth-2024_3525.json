    "Reason : 1 - The front dormer roof extension, by way of its inappropriate and incongruous design, would form an inappropriate addition in principle to the host property in contravention of policies LP1, LP2, and LP5 of the Local Plan (2023) and the Housing SPD (2016). The proposal would also be in contravention of the London Plan (2021) and the NPPF (2024).\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
