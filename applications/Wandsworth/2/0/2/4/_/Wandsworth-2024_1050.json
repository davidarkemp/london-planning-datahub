    "Condition : 1 - The development hereby permitted shall be begun within 3 years from the date of this permission.\r\nReason: To prevent the accumulation of unimplemented planning permissions and to comply with Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended) and to meet the requirements of Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004 and to meet the requirements of The Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015.\r\n",
    "Condition : 2 - The development shall be carried out in accordance with the reports, specifications and drawings detailed in Location Plan, N/07B, N/08C, N/09B, N/10B, N/16H, Daikin Air Conditioning Equipment Quote and Specification (dated 20/05/2023), Fire Safety Statement (within DAS). \r\nReason: To ensure a satisfactory standard of development and to allow the local planning authority to review any potential changes to the scheme. \r\n",
    "Condition : 3 - Prior to occupation of the development the window in the side elevation at first floor level of the development shall be obscure-glazed and non-opening (unless the parts of the window which can be opened are more than 1.7 metres above the floor of the room in which the window is installed).  The window shall so be maintained and retained as such. \r\nReason: To control overlooking and safeguard the privacy of neighbours in accordance with Council policy LP2 of the Wandsworth Local Plan (adopted August 2023) coupled with the requirements of the National Planning Policy Framework.\r\n",
    "Condition : 4 - The roof area of the development hereby permitted shall not be used as a balcony, roof garden or similar amenity area and furthermore, no balustrades, railings or other means of enclosure or means of permanent access shall be erected on this area.\r\nReason: To control overlooking and safeguard the privacy of neighbours in accordance with Council policies LP1 and LP2 of the Local Plan coupled with the requirements of the National Planning Policy Framework.\r\n",
    "Condition : 5 - A noise impact assessment under the provisions of BS4142 2014, which specifically considers the AC units installed at the site shall be undertaken and submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority prior to their further use. The cumulative measured or calculated rating level of noise emitted from the AC units shall be 5dB(A) below the existing background noise level, at all times. The measured or calculated noise levels shall be determined at the boundary of the nearest ground floor noise sensitive premises or 1 metre from the facade of the nearest first floor (or higher) noise sensitive premises in accordance with the latest British Standard 4142. The AC units shall be installed and operated in accordance with the approved details and thereafter maintained. Any approved noise mitigation measures as may be required shall be implemented before the AC units are brought into operation and such measures shall thereafter be retained. Reason: To protect the amenities of neighbouring occupiers, in accordance with policy LP2 of the Wandsworth Local Plan.",
