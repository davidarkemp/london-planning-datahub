    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development would constitute an unsympathetic form of development that would appear overly dominant and relate poorly to the host building, neighbouring properties and wider local spatial character. The proposed development would result in less than substantial harm to the character and appearance of the Nightingale Lane Conservation Area, for which no public benefits have been identified that would outweigh the harm caused to the character and appearance of the conservation area. The proposals are therefore contrary to the NPPF (2023),  policies LP1, LP3 and LP5 of the Wandsworth Local Plan (2023), the Council's Housing SPD (2016) and the Nightingale Lane Conservation Area Appraisal and Management Strategy. ",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed development, by reason of its scale, design and siting would\r\nresult in an unneighbourly form of development that harms the amenity of the\r\nneighbouring occupiers in the form of loss of daylight, outlook and overbearing effects. The proposal therefore fails to comply with policy LP2 of the Wandsworth Local Plan (2023) and the Wandsworth Housing SPD (2016).\r",
    "Reason : 3 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
