    "Reason : 1 - The proposed two-storey rear/side extension, by reason of its overall style, scale, location, siting, mass, and bulk, would be an unsympathetic and incongruous addition which would dominate the host dwelling and would have an undue impact on setting of the host terrace of which it forms part.  The proposed development would fail to preserve or enhance the character and appearance of the host dwelling and host terrace. The proposal would be contrary to paragraph 205 of the NPPF (2023), policy D6 of the London Plan (2021), locally adopted policies LP1 and LP5 of the Local Plan (2023), and 'Housing' SPD (2016).",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
