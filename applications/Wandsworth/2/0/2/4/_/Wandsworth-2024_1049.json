    "Reason : 1 - The proposal, by reason of internal and external amendments resulting in loss of original envelope/form, fabric and features of the host Grade II listed building and insufficient information, would be unsympathetic and would cause less than substantial harm to the special historic and architectural interest and integrity of the Grade II listed building and its contribution to Putney Embankment Conservation Area. There would be no heritage benefits to outweigh this harm. \r\nThe proposal would fail to comply with paragraphs 205 and 208 of the NPPF (2023), section 66 (1)  and section 72 (1) of the Town and Country Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990, policy HC1 (C) of the London Plan (2021), locally adopted policies LP1, LP3 and LP5 of the Local Plan (2023), the SPD 'Housing' (2016) and the Putney Embankment Conservation Area Appraisal and Management Strategy (2010).\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed single storey rear and side extensions and AC unit, by reason of their nature, scale, location and siting and insufficient information, would have an undue impact on the surrounding residential occupiers in terms of overbearing, loss of daylight, visual intrusion and noise. \r\nThe proposal would fail to comply with policy LP2 of the Local Plan (2023). \r\n\r\n\r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably. In addition further guidance was offered to the applicant by the case officer during the processing of the application to identify amendments to address those elements of the scheme considered unacceptable. However, the necessary amendments to make the application acceptable are substantial and would materially change the development proposal. They would require further consultations to be undertaken prior to determination, which could not take place within the statutory determination period specified by the Department of Communities and Local Government. You are therefore encouraged to consider submission of a fresh application incorporating the material amendments set out below which are necessary to make the scheme acceptable. \r\n\r\nRequired amendments:\r\n1. Alterations to rear and side extensions in order to minimise undue impact on the character, appearance and integrity of the host Grade II listed building, avoidance of loss of a historic fabric and envelop/form of the Grade II listed building. Alterations to the extensions also need to be carried in a way so there is not impact on the surrounding residential occupiers in terms of loss of daylight, overbearing and visual intrusion.\r\n2.
