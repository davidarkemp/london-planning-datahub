    "Reason : 1 - the proposed development to extend the property to provide an additional \r\nstorey would be harmful to the character and appearance of the main Coach House itself as well as viewed within the context of the site and of the wider street scene. The inreased in scale and massing of the building would also harm the existing amenities of neighbouring properties in terms of daylight, sunlight, overshadowing, outlook and sense of enclosure. The  proposal is considered contrary to the NPPF, London Plan and the Councilï¿½s Local Plan \r\npolicies, in particular, policies LP1, LP2 and LP5. "
