    "Reason : 1 - By reason of the design and siting of the proposed amendment front roof pitch, it is considered that it would appear incongruous within the street scene, failing to respect the uniformity of other roof-pitches in the terrace, contrary to the principles of good design. It is therefore considered that the proposal would cause unacceptable harm to the character of the application property and wider area, contrary to Policies LP1 and LP5 of the Local Plan, Paragraph 4.151 of the Councils Housing SPD and paragraph 139 of the NPPF.",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
