    "Condition : 2 - INFORMATIVE: You are reminded that this certificate is issued on the basis of the physical circumstances prevailing at the property when the application was made. If any other extension is undertaken BEFORE the construction of the extension, then this certificate would no longer be applicable and planning permission may be required for the development presently proposed.\r\n",
    "Condition : 3 - INFORMATIVE: You are advised that the granting of this certificate does not override your responsibilities under the Party Wall Act 1996.\r\n",
    "Condition : 4 - INFORMATIVE: This certificate is based on the drawings and any other information as submitted being a true reflection of the physical circumstances prevailing at the site on the date of the submission of the application. If the existing conditions are different from those shown on the drawings or if the drawings or any other information are inaccurate in any way, the certificate may not be valid. \r\n"
