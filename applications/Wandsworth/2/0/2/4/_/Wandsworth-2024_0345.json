    "Reason : 1 - The existing property forms part of the evolution of the historic estate and contributes to the character and appearance of the conservation area. The application has failed to demonstrate that the demolition is an appropriate form of development and the replacement dwelling, by reason of its scale, siting and design, would appear incongruous, unsympathetic and visually intrusive, harming the character and appearance of the streetscene and Heaver Estate Conservation Area. The proposal would result in less than substantial harm to the character and appearance of the  Heaver Estate Conservation Area whilst failing to provide public benefit that would outweigh the harm identified. The proposal would therefore contravene with Section 72(1) of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990, the NPPF (2023), policy HC1 of the London Plan (2021), policies LP1 and LP3, of the WLP (2023), the Housing SPD (2016) and the Heaver Estate Conservation Area Appraisal & Management Strategy.",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed development, by reason of its scale, design and siting would result in an unneighbourly form of development that harms the amenity of the neighbouring occupiers in the form of loss outlook, being overbearing and creating an increased sense of enclosure. The proposal therefore fails to comply with policy LP2 of the Wandsworth Local Plan (2023) and the Wandsworth Housing SPD (2016).\r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
