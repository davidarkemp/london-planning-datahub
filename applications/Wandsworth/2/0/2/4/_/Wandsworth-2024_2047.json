    "Reason : 1 - By reason of its proposed external alterations and extensions to the host building, the local planning authority is not satisfied that the proposal would be 'permitted development' which would fall within any part of Class P of Part 3, Schedule 2 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "Reason : 2 - By reason of a lack of sufficient supporting statements, the applicant has failed to provide any compelling evidence to demonstrate that the building was used solely for a storage or distribution centre use on the date referred to in paragraph P.1(a) and for the period referred to in paragraph P.1(b) of Schedule 2, Class P, Part 3 of the Town and Country (General Permitted Development) Order 2015 (as amended). Therefore, the proposal fails to accord with condition  P.2(a) of Schedule 2, Class P, Part 3 of the Town and Country (General Permitted Development) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "Reason : 3 - By reason of its submission date, the application would result in the prior approval date falling on or after 10th June 2019. Therefore, the proposal fails to accord with paragraph P.1(c) of Schedule 2, Class P, Part 3 of the Town and Country (General Permitted Development) Order 2015 (as amended).\r\n",
    "Reason : 4 - Given its siting and lack of supporting evidence, the applicant has failed to demonstrate that noise levels would not lead to detrimental impacts on the amenities of the future occupiers, contrary to policies LP2 and LP14 of the Wandsworth Local Plan (2023) and fails to accord with condition P.2(b)(v) of Schedule 2, Class P, Part 3 of the Town and Country (General Permitted Development) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "Reason : 5 - By reason of a lack of any compelling evidence which clearly illustrates that there has been no demand for the storage facilities and that all other opportunities to re-let/sale have been fully explored, the proposal is considered contrary to policy LP34 of the Local Plan (WLP) (2023) and fails to accord with condition P.2(b)(vi) of Schedule 2, Class P, Part 3 of the Town and Country (General Permitted Development) Order 2015 (as amended)."
