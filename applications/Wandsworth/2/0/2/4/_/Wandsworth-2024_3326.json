  "description": "G1 Mixed group This tree group consists of various small trees and shrubs on the eight-hand boundary. - Remove x2 small Conifers. - Remove x1 larger Leyland Cypress. - Reduce the height of the other items in this group to approx. 2 - 2.5m above ground level. - Trim the sides by as much as possible. T1 Silver Birch - Reduce all aspects of the crown by approx. 2.5 - 3m. - Lift the low hanging branches to approx. 3.5m above ground level. T2 Leyland Cypress - Fell tree in sections to ground level and grind stump to approx. 300mm below ground level. T3 Apple - Remove dead branches. - Reduce the crown by approx. 2m to create a tight and tidy shape. The aim here is to encourage some more internal growth in the lower crown. T4 Wild Cherry - Reduce all aspects of the crown by approx. 2m. T5 Laurel - Fell to ground level and grind stumps to approx. 300mm below ground level. T6 Pittosporum - Remove snapped limb. - Reduce the height by approx. 2m to prevent future branch failure. T7 Cypress - Fell to ground level and grind stump to approx. 300 below ground level. T8 Holly (side passage) - Fell to ground level and grind stump to 300 below ground level. This tree is very close to the house and the roots are interfering with the drains. T9 Holly x2 (front) - Reduce the height to approx. 3m above ground level and reduce over the drive and by the house. - Remove Grape Vine to ground level that is growing through the Holly trees and Magnolia. T11 Magnolia - Reduce the overhanging section by approx. 2m so it no longer overhangs the driveway so much. - Remove Vine as specified in T9 + T10. ",
