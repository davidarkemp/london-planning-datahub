    "Reason : 1 - The proposed first floor extension, by reason of its unsympathetic and alien design and placement, would form an incongruous and harmful addition to the host property, serving to erode its existing character and causing 'less than substantial harm' to the Old York Road Conservation Area, with no public benefits to outweigh the degree of harm identified, in contravention of policies LP1, LP2, LP3 and LP5 of the Local Plan (2023); policies D3 amd  HC1 of the London Plan (2021); the Local Plan SPD 'Housing' (2016); the Old York Road Conservation Area Appraisal and Management Strategy, the objectives of Section 72 (1) of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 and paragraphs 212 and 215 of the NPPF (2024).",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
