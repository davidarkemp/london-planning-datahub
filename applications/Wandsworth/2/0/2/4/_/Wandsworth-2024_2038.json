    "Reason : 1 - The proposed telecommunications equipment, by reason of its design, appearance and siting would represent a visually obtrusive and physically obstructive form of development and result in excessive street clutter that would have a harmful impact on the surrounding area and would impede pdestrian movement in local area given the busy town centre location. The applicant has also failed to demonstrate that the proposal would not have an adverse impact on the safeguarding of the Crossrail 2 infrastructure project. The proposal would therfore not meet with the relevant conditions attached to Class A of Part 16 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order and would be contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2023), policies D8 and SI6 of the London Plan (2021) and policies PM4, LP1, LP2, LP22, LP49 and LP50 of the Wandsworth Local Plan (2023)."
