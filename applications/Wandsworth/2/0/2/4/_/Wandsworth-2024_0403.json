    "Reason : 1 - The development, by reason of its extended opening hours and increased activity on site as well as increased public comings and goings, would cause harm to the amenities of neighbouring occupiers in terms of noise disturbance and nuisance. The proposal therefore fails to comply with policies PM4, LP2, LP14 and LP45 of the Wandsworth Local Plan (2023).\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - INFORMATIVE: The applicant is reminded that planning permission ref: 2017/2849 included the following conditions;\r\nCondition 3 - Details of any external ventilation equipment, including ducting, noise and vibration mitigation, shall be submitted to and approved by the local planning authority before installation. Reason: In the interests of local amenity and visual appearance, and in accordance with Council policy DMS1.\r\nCondition 5 - Details of noise insulation measures to provide effective resistance to the transmission of airborne and impact sound between Class A3 (restaurant) and residential properties to both adjacent sides and above the commercial premises shall be submitted to and approved by the local planning authority. The approved measures shall be completed prior to the commencement of the use of the premises as a restaurant (Class A3). Reason: To safeguard the amenities of adjoining occupiers, in accordance with Council policy DMS1.\r\n\r\nNo application(s) has been received to approve the details in relation to these conditions. If these conditions are not appropriately approved prior to the installation of any such ventilation equipment on site or the first use of the premises, enforcement action would likely be pursued.\r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan and Supplementary Planning documents as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
