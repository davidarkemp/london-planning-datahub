  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development, by reason of layout and design would fail to provide a family sized dwelling with direct access to dedicated private garden space and therefore would result in harm to the housing choice within the borough, contrary to policy LP26 of the Local Plan (2023). \r\n\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed development, by reason of layout and design would fail to provide an acceptable standard of accommodation for future occupiers as the kitchen/dining room within Flat 1 would have poor levels of outlook and daylight/sunlight; Bedroom 4 within Flat 2 would fail to meet minimum bedroom size; and a section drawing has not been provided to demonstrate satisfactory floor to ceiling heights to each of the flats. Furthermore, the drawings are inaccurate. The proposal would therefore be contrary to policy LP27 within the Wandsworth Local Plan (2023), the Technical Housing Standards - Nationally Described Space Standard (2015), the London Plan (2021) and the NPPF (2024).",
    "Reason : 3 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
