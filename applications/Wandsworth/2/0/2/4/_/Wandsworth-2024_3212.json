    "Reason : 1 - The proposal results in the conversion of a property that has a floor area of less than 130sqm as originally constructed and has been determined to be suitable for families. The proposal would therefore result in harm to the existing choice of housing stock within the borough and fails to comply with Policy LP26 of the Wandsworth Local Plan (2023). ",
    "Reason : 2 - By reason of its scale, design and internal arrangement, the development would provide a poor standard of accommodation through inadequate sizing of residential units, floor to ceiling heights and restricted outlook to habitable rooms. In addition, the applicant has failed to demonstrate that the habitable rooms would receive satisfactory levels of daylight and sunlight. The proposal therefore fails to comply with Policy LP27 of the Wandsworth Local Plan (2023), policy D3 of the London Plan (2023), the guidance within the Mayor of London's Housing Supplementary Planning Guidance (2023) and the Wandsworth Housing SPD (2016).",
    "Reason : 3 - By reason of their siting, scale and design, the proposed external walkway and staircase would result in an unneighbourly form of development that harms the amenity of the neighbouring properties in the form of overlooking and loss of privacy. The proposal therefore fails to comply with policy LP2 of the Wandsworth Local Plan (2023) and the Wandsworth Housing SPD (2016).\r\n",
    "Reason : 4 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
