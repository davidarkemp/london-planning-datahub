    "Condition : 1 - The Council raises no objection to the proposal and notes that the proposed gate at Alton Estate would be suitable for disabled users and other vulnerable road users. However, the Council wishes to highlight that there is currently no pathway leading from the private area within the curtilage of Allenford House to the proposed gate, which would need further consideration and a separate consent. However, the Council understands the importance of improved access to Richmond Park as it would support the Council's plans to help regenerate the area and enable new safe and convenient access to the Park. We understand the Royal Parks would not construct the access unless the Council were to provide a route to it on the Wandsworth side. Funding for the Wandsworth route has been identified through the Council's Alton Renewal Plan."
