    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development, by reason of design, scale and location would be an inappropriate form of development, resulting in the permanent loss of garden space, which is considered integral to the spatial character of the location. The proposal would therefore result in a harmful imbalance between built and unbuilt space thus failing to preserve the character and appearance of the Wandsworth Common Conservation Area. The level of harm would not be outweighed by the public benefits offered by the proposal.  As such, the proposal has not overcome the previous reason for refusal and is considered contrary to the objectives of policies LP1 and LP3 of the Local Plan (2023) the as well as the statutory duty under section 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 and the guidance within the NPPF.",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposal, by reason of its scale, design and close proximity to the mature Poplar tree located in No.1 Wandle Road garden (TPO 21 of 1974), would be an inappropriate form of development that would fail to preserve a local heritage feature that contributes positively to the local spatial character and visual amenities of Wandsworth Common Conservation Area. The application has failed to demonstrate the acceptability of the juxtaposition of the extension in terms of location close to the TPO tree and the future relationship of the two elements and as presented, this relationship is not considered to be a reasonable one, with clear foreseeable pressure for the tree to be very substantially reduced or removed as a result. It is therefore considered that the proposed extension would harm a tree of high amenity value that makes a positive contribution to the character and appearance of the conservation area. The application has also failed to demonstrate the acceptability of the loss of two trees and reduction/pruning of five trees. The level of harm would not be outweighed by the public benefits offered by the proposal.  Accordingly the proposal has not overcome the previous reason for refusal and would be contrary to policies LP3 and LP56 of the Local Plan (2023).",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed development, by reason of design, scale and location next to Hendham Road properties would constitute an unneighbourly form of development that would harm the amenities of the neighbouring occupiers in the form of loss outlook through being overbearing and creating an increased and oppressive sense of enclosure. The proposal is therefore considered to be contrary to policy LP2 of the Local Plan (2023).",
    "Reason : 4 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
