  "description": "Erection of new two-storey building on parking area to the rear of 8/9 The Boulevard. To the ground floor, a covered hard standing area will be implemented so that two existing parking spots on site can be retained. The commercial unit at No. 9 will be extended to provide additional non-residential space. To the first floor, there will be a new 2-bedroom residential unit with associated external amenity space. The flat will be accessed on the ground floor via a private entrance and will have appropriate bin and bicycle storage.",

    "Reason : 1 - By reason of its siting, scale and design, the proposed development would result in an unneighbourly form of development that harms the amenity of the neighbouring occupiers in the form of loss outlook, being overbearing, creating an increased sense of enclosure and loss of privacy. The application has also failed to demonstrate that there would not be unacceptable harm to neighbouring windows in respect to reductions in daylight and sunlight. The proposal therefore fails to comply with policy LP2 of the Wandsworth Local Plan (2023) and the Wandsworth Housing SPD (2016). ",
    "Reason : 2 - By reason of its design and internal arrangement, the development would provide a poor standard of accommodation through the provision of unsatisfactory outlook to 'bedroom 2'. In addition, the applicant has failed to demonstrate that the bedroom would receive satisfactory levels of daylight and sunlight. The proposal therefore fails to comply with Policy LP27 of the Wandsworth Local Plan (2023). ",
    "Reason : 3 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the  proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
