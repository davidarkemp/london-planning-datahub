    "Reason : 1 - The proposed telecommunications mast, by reason of its design, appearance and siting would represent a visually obtrusive and discordant form of development that would have a harmful impact on the character and appearance of the surrounding area. The development would also appear significantly overbearing for the rear garden of the neighbouring residential property at no. 1 Fountain Road to the harm of residential amenity. The proposal would therefore not meet with the relevant conditions attached to Class A of Part 16 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order and would be contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2023), policy SI6 of the London Plan (2021) and policies LP1, LP2, and LP22 of the Wandsworth Local Plan (2023)."
