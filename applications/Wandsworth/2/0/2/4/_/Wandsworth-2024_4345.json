    "Reason : 1 - By reason of its design, scale and prominent location, the design of the proposed amended front roof pitch would cause unacceptable harm to the character of the application property, would appear incongruous within the street scene and would be contrary to the principles of good design. The variation of condition 2 would therefore be contrary to policies LP1 and LP5 of the Wandsworth Local Plan (2023), as well as the guidance of the Council's Housing SPD (2016).\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
