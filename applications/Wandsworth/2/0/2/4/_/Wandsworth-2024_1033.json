The development therefore is not in accordance with Council policy LP56 of the Local Plan coupled with the requirements of the National Planning Policy Framework. ",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the submisison fails to adhere to the requirement of the condition and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
