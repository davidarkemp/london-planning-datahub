    "Condition : 1 - This notice indicates that the proposed development would comply with conditions MA.2 of Schedule 2 Part 3 Class M of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 2015 (as amended) (\"the GPDO\"). \r\nIt is a requirement of condition MA.2(5) of the GPDO that the development must be completed within a period of 3 years starting with the prior approval date. \r\nIt is a requirement of condition M.A2(6) of the GPDO that any building permitted to be used as a dwellinghouse by virtue of Class MA is to remain in use as a dwellinghouse within the meaning of Class C3 of Schedule 1 to the Use Classes Order and for no other purpose, except to the extent that the other purpose is ancillary to the use as a dwellinghouse.\r\nIt is a requirement of paragraph W(12) of the GPDO that the development is carried out in accordance with the details provided in the application unless the developer and the local planning authority agree in writing.",
    "Condition : 2 - Prior to commencement of the use hereby permitted, details of the location, number and design of secure and covered cycle parking shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority.  The cycle parking shall be provided in accordance with the approved details prior to the occupation of the development and be retained for cycle parking purposes for the users of the development and for no other purpose.\r\nReason: To ensure adequate provision is made for cycle parking in accordance with Council policies LP2, LP37, LP51, PM2, PM3, PM4, PM6, PM7, PM8 and PM9 of the Local Plan coupled with the requirements of the National Planning Policy Framework.\r\n",
    "Condition : 3 - Prior to the commencement of the use hereby permitted, details of a scheme to demonstrate that the building envelope of the development to which the application refers shall be constructed to provide sound attenuation against externally generated noise sources including road, rail, and aircraft, to achieve the internal ambient noise levels which do not exceed the guideline values contained in Table 4 of British Standard BS 8233:2014 Guidance on Sound Insulation and Noise Reduction for Buildings shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority. The measured or calculated noise levels shall be determined in accordance with British Standard 8233:2014. Any works which form part of the scheme shall be completed in accordance with the approved details before the dwellings are occupied and shall thereafter be retained as approved. Internal noise levels should be achieved with windows open for cooling purposes. Where this cannot be achieved alternative means of ventilation and cooling will be required. Where whole house ventilation is provided then acoustically treated inlets and outlets should ideally be located away from the faï¿½ade(s) most exposed to noise.\r\nReason: To safeguard the amenities of residential occupiers, in accordance with Council policy LP2 and LP14 of the Local Plan coupled with the requirements of the National Planning Policy Framework.",
    "Condition : 4 - Prior to the commencement of the use hereby permitted, details of a scheme for the sound insulation of the separating wall between the neighbouring ground floor commercial property and the proposed residential unit shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority, and the approved scheme shall be implemented prior to the first occupation of any dwelling and shall be retained thereafter.  \r\nReason: To safeguard the amenities of residential occupiers, in accordance with Council policy LP2 and LP14 of the Local Plan coupled with the requirements of the National Planning Policy Framework.\r\n"
