    "Reason : 1 - The proposed roof extension, by reason of its siting, scale and design, would be a prominent, visually intrusive and unsympathetic addition that would harm the appearance of the original building, terrace and streetscene. The proposed development is considered to result in less than substantial harm to the character and appearance of the Wandsworth Common Conservation Area which would not be outweighed by public benefits. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Section 71(1) of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990, the NPPF (2023), and policies LP1, LP3 and LP5 of the Wandsworth Local Plan (2023). \r\n\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
