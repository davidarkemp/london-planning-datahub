    "Reason : 1 - The proposed extension, which would be highly visible from the streetscene, would be overly large and dominant and would fail to remain subservient to the host property which would be unacceptabley harmed while the spatial chareter would also be unacceptabley harmed. The proposal fails to comply with the guidance of the Housing SPD (2016) and with policies LP1 and LP5 of the Wandsworth Local Plan (2023).\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed two-storey rear extension would would uneighbourly and would lead to an unacceptable sense of enclosure through being overbearing for the neighbouring property at no. 92 Roseneath Road. The proposed roof terrace would also be sufficiently large to host large gatherings of people and potentially harm neighbouring amenity through unacceptable noise disturbance. The proposal would therefore result in an unacceptable impact on the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties and the proposal fails to comply with policy LP2 of the Wandsworth Local Plan (2023) and the Housing SPD 2016. \r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably. In addition further guidance was offered to the applicant by the case officer during the processing of the application to identify amendments to address those elements of the scheme considered unacceptable. However, the necessary amendments to make the application acceptable are substantial and would materially change the development proposal. They would require further consultations to be undertaken prior to determination, which could not take place within the statutory determination period specified by the Department of Communities and Local Government.
