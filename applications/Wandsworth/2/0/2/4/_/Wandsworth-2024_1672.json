    "Condition : 1 - The development hereby permitted shall be begun within 3 years from the date of this permission.\r\nReason: To prevent the accumulation of unimplemented planning permissions and to comply with Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended) and to meet the requirements of Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004 and to meet the requirements of The Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015.\r\n",
    "Condition : 2 - The development shall be carried out in accordance with the reports, specifications and drawings detailed [**************]. \r\nReason: To ensure a satisfactory standard of development and to allow the local planning authority to review any potential changes to the scheme. \r\n",
    "Condition : 3 - All external materials used in the construction of the development hereby approved shall match the type, texture, tone, colour, size and profile of those used on the existing building and shall be retained permanently. \r\nReason: In the interest of the appearance of the development and to safeguard visual amenity, in accordance with Council policies LP1 and LP2 of the Local Plan coupled with the requirements of the National Planning Policy Framework.\r\n",
    "Condition : 4 - Prior to commencement of use of the terrace as shown on drawing numbers CP-2023-45 | S1-10 and CP-2023-45 | S1-20, the obscure glazed screening to each side and rear at a minimum height of 1.7m above finished floor level shall be installed.  The screening shall be retained and maintained as such thereafter.\r\nReason: To protect the privacy of neighbours by preventing overlooking and in the interest of visual amenity in accordance with Council policies LP1, LP2 and LP27 of the Local Plan coupled with the requirements of the National Planning Policy Framework.\r\n",
    "Condition : 5 - The development shall achieve a maximum water use of 110 litres per person per day for homes (including an allowance of five litres or less per person per day for\r\nexternal water consumption) in line with the Water Efficiency Calculator for new dwellings from the Department of Communities and Local Government. Prior to first occupation, evidence to demonstrate that that the internal water consumption of the development will not exceed 105l/p/day must be submitted to the local planning authority and approved in writing, unless otherwise agreed in writing by the local planning authority. Measures integrated shall be retained for the lifetime of the development.\r\nReason: In the interest of sustainable development and to accord with Council policy LP1, LP2, LP10 of the Local Plan coupled with the requirements of the National Planning Policy Framework.",
    "Condition : 6 - INFORMATIVE: In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. The Council has made available detailed advice in the form of its statutory policies in the Local Plan (2023) as well as offering a full pre-application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably. In addition, where appropriate, further guidance was offered to the applicant during the processing of the application.",
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed first floor roof terrace, by reason of its positioning and size constitutes an unneighbourly form of development that would result in actual and perceived loss of privacy and noise and disturbance, to the harm of the neighbouring occupiers amenity at No.72 Bennerley Road. The proposal therefore fails to comply with policy LP2 of the WLP (2023) and guidance within the Housing SPD (2016). \r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
