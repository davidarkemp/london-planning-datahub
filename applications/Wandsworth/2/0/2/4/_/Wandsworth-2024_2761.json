  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development, by reason of its height, scale, massing, forward projection, and attachment to the existing semi-detached dwelling at No.26 Blenkarne Road, would result in a visually dominant and incongruous addition that disrupts the established pattern and rhythm of development. The design, including its flats roof and disjointed faï¿½ade elements, fails to respect the architectural character of the surrounding street scene. Consequently, the proposal would cause less than substantial harm to the significance of the Wandsworth Common Conservation Area, which is not outweighed by any public benefits. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies LP1,LP3 and LP7 of the Wandsworth Local Plan (2023), Policy HC1 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2024).  ",
    "Reason : 2 - By reason of the primary living, dining and kitchen accommodation being located at basement level, with sole access to daylight from a ceiling height walk-on area of glazing, the proposed development would provide future occupiers with highly constrained levels of outlook. In the absence of a Daylight and Sunlight Assessment, it has not been demonstrated that acceptable levels of natural internal daylight would be achieved. The proposal would therefore provide substandard internal living conditions for future occupiers, contrary to Policy LP2 and LP27 of the Wandsworth Local Plan (2023), Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2024).  ",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed development would provide no private amenity space.The lack of amenity space would not provide the opportunity for a usable or functional area for future occupiers. The proposal would therefore fail to provide private amenity space of an acceptable quality, contrary to Policy LP2 and LP27 of the Wandsworth Local Plan (2023), Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2024).  ",
    "Reason : 4 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
