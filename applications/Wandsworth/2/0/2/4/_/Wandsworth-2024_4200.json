    "Reason : 1 - Condition A.A.2. (3)(a)(ii)  of Schedule 2, Part 1, Class AA of The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended) states that the local planning authority must assess the external appearance of the proposed development, including the design and architectural features of the principal elevation of the dwellinghouse, and any side elevation of the dwellinghouse that fronts a highway.\r\n\r\nAs such, the local planning authority considers that the design and appearance of the proposed development, by reason of its scale and siting, would be a visually prominent, intrusive and incongruous addition to the terrace property, detrimentally detracting from the local spatial character. The proposal therefore fails to comply with the NPPF (2024), policies LP1 and LP5 of the Wandsworth Local Plan (2023) and the guidance within the Housing SPD (2016).\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The local planning authority is not satisfied that all the proposed external alterations at ground level and the installation of new boundary treatment fall within any part of Class AA of Part 1, Schedule 2 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended)",
    "Reason : 3 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
