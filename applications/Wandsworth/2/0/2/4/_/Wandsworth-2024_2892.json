    "Reason : 1 - The development, by reason of its scale and design, occupying almost the full area of the roof of the existing two-storey back addition and extending 2.3m in height with vertical rear and side elevations, would appear unsympathetic, overly bulky, top-heavy and overly dominant in appearance. The proposal would therefore be detrimental to the appearance of the host property and surrounding terrace. The proposal therefore fails to comply with policies LP1 and LP5 of the Wandsworth Local Plan (2023) as well as the guidance of the Housing SPD (2016). \r\n\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The development, by reason of its scale, design and position would be an unneighbourly addition, harming the amenities of neighbouring occupiers at nos. 221/223 Sellincourt Road in terms of a loss of daylight, outlook and an increased sense of overbearing. The proposal therefore fails to comply with policy LP2 of the Wandsworth Local Plan (2023) as well as the guidance of the Housing SPD (2016). \r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably. In addition further guidance was offered to the applicant by the case officer during the processing of the application to identify amendments to address those elements of the scheme considered unacceptable. However, the necessary amendments to make the application acceptable are substantial and would materially change the development proposal. They would require further consultations to be undertaken prior to determination, which could not take place within the statutory determination period specified by the Department of Communities and Local Government. \r\n"
