  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - By reason of its scale, design and location the roof extension over the two-storey back addition is an over dominant and unsympathetic extension that fails to relate appropriately to the original building and locate spatial character. The dominance of the extension is contributed to by the presence of first floor and substantial ground floor extensions. The development is therefore contrary to policies LP1 and LP5 of the Local Plan (2023) and the Housing SPD (2016). \r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - By reason of its scale, design and location the ground floor extension is an unneighbourly form of development, that results in harm to the amenity of the neighbouring occupiers through unacceptable loss of outlook, increased sense of enclosure and reductions in daylight/sunlight. The development is therefore contrary to policy LP2 of the Local Plan (2023) and the Housing SPD (2016). ",
    "Reason : 3 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan and Supplementary Planning documents  as well as offering a full pre application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably.However, the necessary amendments to make the application acceptable are substantial and would materially change the development proposal.  You are therefore encouraged to consider submission of a fresh application incorporating the material amendments set out below which are necessary to make the scheme acceptable. \r\n\r\nRequired amendments:\r\n- Slope rear elevation of extension over two-storey back addiion at 70 degrees (as per planning application 2024/0388)\r\n- Reduce height of ground floor extension on the boundaries (as per planning application 2024/0388)\r\n"
