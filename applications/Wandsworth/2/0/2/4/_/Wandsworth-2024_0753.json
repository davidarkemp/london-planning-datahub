    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development, due to its scale and form, would result in unsympathetic and overly dominant additions to the host property, unduly increasing its visual prominence and causing less than substantial harm to the character and appearance of this part of the Putney Embankment with no public benefits to outweigh the identified harm.  The proposed development would therefore be contrary to Local Plan (July 2023) policies LP1 and LP3; the objectives of the NPPF (2023) and Section 72(1) of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990.\r\n\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
