  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - By reason of the extent of proposed demolition to an existing building which is identified as making a positive contribution to the character and appearance of the conservation area the historic paterna of age of the property would be lost, which would cause harm to the character and appearance of the application property and less than substantial harm to the character and appearance of the conservation area, with no public benefit put forward. The proposal is therefore contrary to Section 72(1) and 66(1) of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990, NPPF paragraph 208, London Plan (2021) Policy HC1 and Local Plan (2023) Policy LP3.  ",
    "Reason : 2 - By reason of the scale of the proposed rear roof extension and single storey rear extension, they would fail to maintain subservience to the existing property, detracting from the historic character of the property. Harm would therefore be caused to the character and appearance of the existing property and less than substantial harm to the wider conservation area, with no public benefit. The proposal is therefore contrary to Section 72(1) and 66(1) of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990, NPPF paragraph 208, London Plan (2021) Policy HC1 and Local Plan (2023) Policy LP3.  ",
    "Reason : 3 - By reason of the scale and siting of the proposed extended roof terrace, unacceptable harm would be caused to the privacy of neighbouring residents by virtue of increased overlooking opportunities. The proposal is therefore contrary to Local Plan (2023) Policy LP2. ",
    "Reason : 4 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
