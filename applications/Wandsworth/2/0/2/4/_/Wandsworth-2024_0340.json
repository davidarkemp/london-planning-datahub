    "Reason : 1 - By reason of its design, scale and prominent location, the design of the proposed amended front roof pitch would cause unacceptable harm to the character of the application property, would appear incongruous within the street scene and would be contrary to the principles of good design. The variation of condition 2 would therefore be contrary to policies LP1 and LP5 of the Wandsworth Local Plan (2023), as well as the guidance of the Council's Housing SPD (2016).\r\n",

The variation of condition 2 would therefore be contrary to policies LP27 and LP51 of the Wandsworth Local Plan (2023). ",
