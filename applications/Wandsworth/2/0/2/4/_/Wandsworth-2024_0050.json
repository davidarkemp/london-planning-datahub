    "Reason : 1 - The proposed roof terrace by reason of its design, scale and location would result in a visually obtrusive and incongruous form of development that would relate poorly to and adversely impact the character and appearance of the host property and surrounding area. The proposal is therefore contrary to the policies LP1 and LP5 of the Wandsworth Local Plan (2023) and the Wandsworth Council's Housing Supplementary Planning Document (2016).\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
