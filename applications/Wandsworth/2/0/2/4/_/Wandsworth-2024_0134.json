    "Reason : 1 - The proposed dwelling by reason of its location, scale and design would be an inappropriate form of development. The dwelling would be within part of an undeveloped garden and form a prominent and incongruous feature that would result in a harmful impact to the character and appearance of the surrounding area. As such the proposal would be contrary to policies LP1 and LP7 of the Wandsworth Local Plan (2023).\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The development, by reason of design and layout would provide substandard accommodation for future occupiers including an unacceptable level of outlook and natural ventilation to the basement bedroom. Therefore, the proposal fails to comply with policy LP27 of the Wandsworth Local Plan 2023 and policy D6 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "Reason : 3 - By reason of their siting, scale and design, the proposed dwelling extensions would result in an unneighbourly form of development that harms the\r\namenity of the neighbouring properties in the form of loss outlook, being\r\noverbearing, creating an increased sense of enclosure The proposal\r\ntherefore fails to comply with policies LP2 of the Wandsworth Local Plan (2023) and the Wandsworth Housing SPD (2016).\r\n",

    "Reason : 4 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
