    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development fails to achieve a satisfactory standard of design as the extension would not be in-keeping with appearance of the host dwelling, as its flat roof extending above the eaves of the house would fail to appear subservient and would fail to integrate with the design of the host property. The proposal therefore fails to achieve a suitable degree of compliance with policies LP1, LP3 and LP5 as well as the guidance of the Housing SPD (2016). \r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed two-storey element would detrimentally impact on the residential amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties as it would result in a loss of light, outlook and sense of overbearing and enclosure for the neighbouring property. The proposal therefore fails to achieve a sufficient degree of compliance with the objectives of policy LP2 and with the guidance of the Housing SPD (2016).\r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably. In addition further guidance was offered to the applicant by the case officer during the processing of the application to identify amendments to address those elements of the scheme considered unacceptable. However, the necessary amendments to make the application acceptable are substantial and would materially change the development proposal. They would require further consultations to be undertaken prior to determination, which could not take place within the statutory determination period specified by the Department of Communities and Local Government. \r\n"
