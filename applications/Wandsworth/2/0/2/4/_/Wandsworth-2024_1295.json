    "Reason : 1 - The proposed extension to the existing unit due to its scale and location would be an inappropriate overdevelopment of the site, resulting in an unacceptable intensification of use and resulting in a negative impact on the amenity of the existing property and that of neighbouring occupiers failing to meet the requirements of policies LP1, LP2 and LP5 of the Wandsworth Local Plan 2023. ",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
