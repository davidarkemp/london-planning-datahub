  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed rear extension, due to its scale and form, would result in an unduly oversized and overbearing addition, failing to be subservient and sympathetic to the host property, and creating an overbearing element that would cause harm to the amenity of adjacent residents through an increased sense of enclosure and overshadowing contrary to policies LP1; LP2; LP3 and LP5 of the Local Plan (2023). ",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed front enclosed porch would  result in an uncharacteristic element that would be detrimental to the appearance of the host property and its setting, causing 'less than substantial harm' to the character and appearance of this part of the  Wandsworth Common conservation area, with no public benefits to outweigh the harm identified, contrary to policies LP1, LP3, and LP5 of the Local Plan (2023), Section 72 (1) of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990, and paragraphs 208 and 212 of the NPPF (2024).",
    "Reason : 3 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
