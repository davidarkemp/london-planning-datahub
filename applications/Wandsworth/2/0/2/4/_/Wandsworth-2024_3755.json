    "Condition : 1 - This notice indicates that the proposed development would comply with conditions MA.2 of Schedule 2 Part 3 Class M of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 2015 (as amended) (\"the GPDO\"). \r\nIt is a requirement of condition MA.2(5) of the GPDO that the development must be completed within a period of 3 years starting with the prior approval date. \r\nIt is a requirement of condition M.A2(6) of the GPDO that any building permitted to be used as a dwellinghouse by virtue of Class MA is to remain in use as a dwellinghouse within the meaning of Class C3 of Schedule 1 to the Use Classes Order and for no other purpose, except to the extent that the other purpose is ancillary to the use as a dwellinghouse.\r\nIt is a requirement of paragraph W(12) of the GPDO that the development is carried out in accordance with the details provided in the application unless the developer and the local planning authority agree in writing.",
    "Condition : 2 - Prior to commencement of use hereby permitted,  details of a scheme of measures to insulate the dwelling against external noise (including from road and pavement users) shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority. The scheme shall include how the development will achieve internal noise levels which meet the guideline values contained in Table 4 of BS 8233:2014 and include details of fa�ade construction, glazing (with Rw values for whole unit including frames) and ventilation. Any works which form part of the scheme shall be completed in accordance with the approved details before the dwelling is occupied and shall thereafter be retained as approved. Internal noise levels should be achieved with windows open for cooling purposes. Where this cannot be achieved alternative means of ventilation and cooling will be required. Where whole house ventilation is provided then acoustically treated inlets and outlets should ideally be located away from the fa�ade(s) most exposed to noise.\r\nReason: To protect the occupiers of the building, in accordance with Council policies LP2, LP14, LP27 and LP45 of the Local Plan coupled with the requirements of the National Planning Policy Framework. The details are required prior to commencement of development to ensure the necessary mitigation is incorporated into the construction.",
    "Condition : 3 - Prior to commencement of use hereby permitted, a scheme for the sound insulation of the separating walls between the adjacent ground floor commercial uses and the dwelling shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority. The scheme approved by the local planning authority shall be fully implemented in accordance with the approved details before the dwelling is occupied. No alteration to the scheme which undermines the integrity of the sound insulation shall be undertaken without the written consent of the local planning authority. Reason: To safeguard the amenities of residential occupiers, in accordance with Council policy LP2, LP14 and LP45 of the Local Plan coupled with the requirements of the National Planning Policy Framework. The details are required prior to commencement of development to ensure the necessary mitigation is incorporated into the construction."
