    "Reason : 1 - Tree on 12/06/24 not showing signs of decline within canopy, photo supplied taken in winter.\r\n Any dead wood can be removed without application. \r\nEvidence not supplied that tree removal is necessary to facilitate patio works. \r\nEvidence not supplied of any risk to cause damage to the building that would necessitate removal.  \r\nPlanning Portal guidance states that evidence needed to remove tree for property damage includes : \r\n\r\no A description of the property, including a description of the damage and the crack pattern, the date that the damage first occurred/was noted, details of any previous underpinning or building work, the geological strata for the site identified from the geological map \r\no Details of vegetation in the vicinity and its management since discovery of the damage. Include a plan showing the vegetation and affected building \r\no Measurement of the extent and distribution of vertical movement using level monitoring. Where level monitoring is not possible, state why and provide crack[1]monitoring data. Data provided must be sufficient to show a pattern of movement consistent with the presence of the implicated tree(s) \r\no A profile of a trial/bore hole dug to identify foundation type and depth and soil characteristics \r\no The sub-soil characteristics including soil type (particularly that on which the foundations rest), liquid limit, plastic limit and plasticity index \r\no The location and identification of roots found. Where identification is inconclusive, DNA testing should be carried out \r\no Proposals and estimated costs of options to repair the damage \r\n\r\nIn addition, you must include a report from an arboriculturist to support the tree work proposals, including arboricultural options for avoidance or remediation of indirect tree related damage\r\n"
