    "Reason : 1 - The proposed roof extensions by reason of their design, scale and siting, are considered to detract from the positive contribution of the subject property to the character area and therefore cause harm to the character, appearance and significance of the West Putney Conservation Area contrary to the provisions of policies LP1, LP3 and LP5 of the Local Plan (2023) and the West Putney Conservation Area Appraisal and Management Strategy, without there being public benefits to outweigh this harm, contrary to the provisions of paragraph 205 and 208 of the NPPF and the objectives of Section 72 (1) of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990.",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
