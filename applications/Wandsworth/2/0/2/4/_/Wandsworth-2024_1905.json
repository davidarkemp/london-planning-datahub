    "Reason : 1 - The proposal constitutes development under the Town and Country Planning Act 1990, and the local planning authority is not satisfied that, based on the drawings submitted as part of the application, this proposal falls within any class of 'permitted development' specified within Schedule 2 to the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).\r\nINFORMATIVE: The proposed development fails to comply with condition A.2 1 (c) of Class A of Part 16, Schedule 2 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended) as within a conservation area the visual impact of the development must be minimised so far as practicable and given the scale and massing of the proposed mast and cabinets, the development would be highly prominent and intrusive. There is also insufficent evidence to illustrate that the mast would be less than two thirds wider at the top in line with 3 (d) (ii) (aa) and 4 (e) (i).\r\n\r\n"
