    "Reason : 1 - The proposed roof extension by reason of its scale, siting and design would be a  visually intrusive and incongruous form of development that would fail to appear suitably subservient or relate sympathetically to the character and appearance of the local area. The proposal would result in an over dominant harmful intervention and therefore fails to comply with the NPPF (2024), policies LP1 and LP5 of the Wandsworth Local Plan (2023) and the guidance within the Housing SPD (2016).\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed roof extension, by reason of its scale, siting and design, would be an unneighbourly form of development that would result in a loss of outlook for the neighbouring occupiers at no. 37 Rowena Crescent, as well as creating an increased sense of enclosure for users of the balcony at that property. The proposal therefore fails to accord with policy LP2 of the Wandsworth Local Plan (2023). \r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service.
