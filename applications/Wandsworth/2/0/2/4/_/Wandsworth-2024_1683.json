    "Reason : 1 - The air conditioning unit by reason of its size, location and appearance would constitute an unsympathetic and incongruous form of development that would result in harm to the character and appearance of the property as well as the Clapham Common Conservation Area. The proposal therefore fails to comply with the objectives of the NPPF (2023), Section 72(1) of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990, policies LP1, LP3 and LP5 of the Wandsworth Local Plan (2023), guidance within the Housing SPD (2016) and the Clapham Common Conservation Area & Management Strategy (2007).",
    "Reason : 2 - The air conditioning unit by reason of its siting and lack of detail on its specifications and noise levels, insufficient evidence has been provided to ensure that the installation would not result in noise and disturbance for the adjoining occupiers, and therefore would result in harm to the neighbouring amenities. The proposal fails to comply with policies LP2 and LP14 of the Wandsworth Local Plan (2023).",
    "Reason : 3 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
