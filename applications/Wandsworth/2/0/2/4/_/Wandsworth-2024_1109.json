    "Reason : 1 - The proposed air conditioning unit, by reason of its siting and location, would result in an incongruous and uncharacteristic form of development that would appear visually intrusive within the streetscene, causing harm to the special character and appearance of the Wandsworth Town Conservation Area. It would also likely detrimentally impact residential amenity due to the potential for unacceptable noise and nuisance. \r\n\r\nTherefore, the scheme fails to be in accordance with the aims of the NPPF (2023); the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act (1990); policy HC1 of the London Plan (2021); policies LP1, LP2 and LP3 of the Wandsworth Local Plan (2023); and the Wandsworth Town Conservation Area Appraisal.\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
