    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development by reason of its siting, scale, bulk and design would result in a highly prominent, over-dominant and incongruous roof feature that would relate poorly to the host property and terrace to which it forms part of. The proposal would therefore be harmful to the character and appearance of the host property and to the visual amenities of the street scene. Accordingly, the proposal fails to comply with policies LP1 and LP5 of the Wandsworth Local Plan (2023) and the Housing SPD (2016)\r\n\r\n\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
