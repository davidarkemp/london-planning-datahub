    "Reason : 1 - 1. The proposed alteration would have an adverse impact on the character of the Johns Hill Grove Conservation Area resulting in less than substantial harm to a heritage asset without justification or public benefit gains. This would be contrary to paragraphs 205, 206 and 208 of the NPPF (2023), Section 72 (1) of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990, Policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies LP1, LP3 and LP5 of the Wandsworth Local Plan 2023-2038.\r\n\r\n2. The proposed extension would appear intrusive and raise perception of overlooking onto rear facing neighbouring properties, contrary to Policy LP2 of the of the Wandsworth Local Plan 2023-2038.\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably. In addition further guidance was offered to the applicant by the case officer during the processing of the application to identify amendments to address those elements of the scheme considered unacceptable. However, the necessary amendments to make the application acceptable are substantial and would materially change the development proposal. They would require further consultations to be undertaken prior to determination, which could not take place within the statutory determination period specified by the Department of Communities and Local Government. You are therefore encouraged to consider submission of a fresh application incorporating the material amendments set out below which are necessary to make the scheme acceptable. \r\n\r\nRequired amendments:\r\n************************************************************\r\n"
