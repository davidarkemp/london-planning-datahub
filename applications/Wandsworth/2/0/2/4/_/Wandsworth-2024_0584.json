    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development, by reason of reason of its scale, design and location would result in a prominent, overdominant and incongruous addition to the dwelling that would fail to relate appropriately to its context to the harm of the appearance and character of the host property and streetscene. The proposal therefore fails to comply with of policies LP1 and LP5 of the Wandsworth Local Plan (2023) and guidance within the Housing SPD (2016).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed development, by reason of reason of its scale, design and location would constitute an unneighbourly form of development that would appear overbearing, result in loss of outlook and an increase sense of enclosure for neighbouring occupiers. Furthermore, the application has also failed to demonstrate that there would not be unacceptable reduction in daylight and sunlight to neighbouring properties. The proposal therefore fails to comply with policy LP2 of the Wandsworth Local Plan (2023) and guidance within the Housing SPD (2016).",
    "Reason : 3 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
