    "Condition : 2 - The maximum steady brightness of any screen hereby permitted is not to exceed 300 candelas per sq.m.\r\nReason: To ensure the sign does not have an adverse effect on the amenity of the area in accordance with Council policy LP9 of the Local Plan and to comply with paragraph 132 of the National Planning Policy Framework.",
    "Condition : 3 - TfL INFORMATIVES:\r\n- The footway and carriageway, including the bus stop on Upper Richmond Road must not be blocked during the development. Temporary obstructions during the development must be kept to a minimum and should not encroach on the clear space needed to provide safe passage for pedestrians or obstruct the flow of traffic on the Upper Richmond Road.\r\n\r\n- All vehicles associated with the development must only park/ stop at permitted locations and within the time periods permitted by existing on-street restrictions.\r\n\r\n- Illumination for the proposed sign must remain below the limit set out in the Institute of Lighting Professionals (ILP) publication: The Brightness of Illuminated Advertisements including digital displays (PLG05/23, 2023).\r\n\r\n- TfL expects a maximum of 300 cd/m2  for after dark conditions when the advert is illuminated. \r\n\r\n- For lighting during the day, either no lighting, or maximum lighting levels (such as for digital displays) are set in accord with night time maximums, or controlled so they comply with the guidance approach to ambient lighting. \r\n\r\n- There should be no special effects (including noise, smell, smoke, animation, exposed cold cathode tubing, flashing, scrolling, three dimensional, intermittent or video elements) of any kind. This is in the interest of highway safety on the TLRN.\r\n\r\n- The applicant must enter into a s278 agreement with TfL for the proposed works. The applicant should contact TfL's s278 team to progress (section278team@tfl.gov.uk).\r\n"
