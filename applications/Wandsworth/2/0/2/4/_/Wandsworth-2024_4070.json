    "Reason : 1 - The proposal would combine a family sized dwelling with a non-family-sized dwelling, with the total floorspace of the new dwelling created being more than 130sqm. The proposal would therefore result in harm to the supply and choice of housing within the borough and fails to comply with Wandsworth Local Plan (2023) policy LP25.\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed extensions to the main roof and to the rear elevation are viewed as an inappropriate form of development which fails to respond to the context, namely scale and appearance, of the host dwelling, failing to be subservient, and detracts from the character and appearance of the conservation area, causing less than substantial harm. There are no public benefits to outweigh this harm. The proposal therefore fails to comply with policies LP1, LP3, or LP5 of the Local Plan (2023) nor the statutory duty of Section 72 (1) of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990. It also fails to meet Policy HC1 (C) of the London Plan (2021) and paragraphs 212-215 of the NPPF (2024). The proposal also does not follow best practice guidance within the Housing SPD.\r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - A fire safety statement has not been provided, thereby failing to meet the requirements of Policy D12 of the London Plan (2021).\r\n",
    "Reason : 4 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
