  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - By reason of their design, scale, massing and siting, it is considered that the proposed additions to the property would appear overly dominant, would fail to maintain subservience to the existing property and would disrupt the established rear building line of the group of 6 terraced properties of which the application property is a part, resulting in an incongruous form of development that would cause significant harm the character and appearance of the host property and that of the wider terrace in which it is set, contrary to policies  LP1 and LP5 of the Local Plan (2023) and the Councils adopted Housing SPD.",
    "Reason : 2 - By reason of their size, siting close to a number of neighbouring residential properties and the combination of terraces at both first and second floor level, it is considered that the proposed roof terraces would be unneighbourly, creating a significant sense of perceived overlooking to the rear amenity space and rear fenestration of properties to the rear and appearing unduly overbearing, causing significant harm to neighbour amenity contrary to Policy LP2B of the Local Plan (2023).",
    "Reason : 3 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
