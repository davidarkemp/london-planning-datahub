    "Reason : 1 - The proposed 1-bedroom 2-person first floor flat would fall short of the minimum floorspace requirement of the Technical Housing Standards Nationally Described Space Standard (2015). The proposal therefore fails to comply with policy LP27 of the Wandsworth Local Plan (2023).",
    "Reason : 2 - By reason of its design, size and siting, the proposed rear roof extension with a vertical rear elevation would appear overly bulky. The proposed first floor roof terrace would also appear incongruous within the rear elevation, to the detriment of the appearance of the host property. The proposed rear roof extension and first floor terrace fail to accord with policies LP1 and LP5 of the Wandsworth Local Plan (2023) and with the guidance of the Housing SPD (2016). ",

The proposed rear roof extension and first floor terrace fail to accord with policies LP1 and LP5 of the Wandsworth Local Plan (2023) and with the guidance of the Housing SPD (2016). ",
    "Reason : 3 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably. In addition further guidance was offered to the applicant by the case officer during the processing of the application to identify amendments to address those elements of the scheme considered unacceptable. However, the necessary amendments to make the application acceptable are substantial and would materially change the development proposal. They would require further consultations to be undertaken prior to determination, which could not take place within the statutory determination period specified by the Department of Communities and Local Government. \r\n"
