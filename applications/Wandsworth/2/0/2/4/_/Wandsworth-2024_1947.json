  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development by reason of it is appearance, scale and siting represents a visually obtrusive and incongruous addition that relates poorly to the locally listed host building and its setting. The extension also fails to integrate with its surroundings and detracts from the local spatial character. The proposal would reasult in less than substantial harm to the character and appearance of the Old Devonshire Road Conservation Area and the level of harm is not outweighed by public benefits. The proposal therefore fails to comply with policies LP1 and LP3 of the Wandsworth Local Plan (2023).\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The application has failed to provide sufficient arboricultural reason and justification for the removal of two mature trees (T1 Oak and T2 Robinia) from the garden. The mature trees make a positive contribution to local visual amenity and their loss on the site would result in harm to the character and appearance of the Old Devonshire Road Conservation Area. The level of harm would not be outweighed by public benefits. The proposal therefore fails to comply with the NPPF (2023), policies LP3 and LP56 of the Wandsworth Local Plan (2023).",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed development would be an intensification of the use of the garden over a greater period of the year and result in an increase in the volume and frequency of customer noise to the harm of neighbouring residential occupiers. The applicant has failed to submit details of how this noise is to be mitigated and managed. There is also the potential for light disturbance to neighbouring properties and the applicant has failed to submit sufficient details of the lighting and any necessary mitigation of its impact on neighbouring residents. The proposals therefore would result in harm to the amenities of neighbouring residential occupiers and is contrary to policies LP2, LP14 and LP45 of the Wandsworth Local Plan (2023). \r\n",
    "Reason : 4 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
