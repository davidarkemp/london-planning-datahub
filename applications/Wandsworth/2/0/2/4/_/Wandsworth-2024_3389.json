    "Reason : 1 - The development, by reason of its scale, design and location would result in a prominent and incongruous addition that would harm the character and appearance of the host property and streetscene. The proposal has not overcome the previous reason for refusal and therefore fails to comply with policies LP1 and LP5 of the Wandsworth Local Plan (2023) and the Housing SPD (2016).",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
