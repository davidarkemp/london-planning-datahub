    "Reason : 1 - The proposal, by reason of its design and siting would result in an arbitary form of developent that would fail to preserve the character and appearance of the property as well as the Wandsworth Common Conservation Area. The proposal therefore fails to comply with policies LP1, LP3 and LP5 of the WLP (2023), guidance within the Housing SPD (2016) and the Wandsworth Common Conservation Area & Management Strategy. \r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
