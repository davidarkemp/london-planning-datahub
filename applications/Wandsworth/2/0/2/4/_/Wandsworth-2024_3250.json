    "Reason : 1 - By reason of their design, siting and scale, the proposed increased ridge height, alterations to roof pitch and installation of front rooflight would form prominent, unsympathetic and visually intrusive additions to the original building, streetscene and locality. The proposals would therefore result in harm to the character and appearance of the Totterdown Fields Conservation Area and is contrary to the NPPF (2023), policies LP1, LP3 and LP5 of the Wandsworth Local Plan (2023) and the Housing (2016). ",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
