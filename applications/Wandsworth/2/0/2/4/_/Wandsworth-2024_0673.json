    "Condition : 1 - INFORMATIVE: The applicant is advised that Historic England have requested that the report related shape-files be submitted to them as a submission of detail towards the satisfying of the archaeological condition and to ensure that it accords with relevant standards and guidance in compliance with the condition. On-going archaeological interest can be mitigated by monitoring and recording to occur during the main ground disturbance works associated with the proposed development and Historic England will review the anticipated mitigation WSI, required as part of the conditioned response. Once the mitigation WSI has been approved, the start date when known should be communicated by the applicants archaeological practice to Historic England who will then conduct monitoring visits.\r\nThe applicant is reminded that the archaeological condition will not be fully satisfied until all works are complete including any post-excavation assessment/analysis leading to publication.\r\n"
