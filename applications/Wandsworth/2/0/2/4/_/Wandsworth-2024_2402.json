    "Condition : 2 - The development shall be carried out in accordance with the reports, specifications and drawings detailed PUT_002 \r\nReason: To ensure a satisfactory standard of development and to allow the local planning authority to review any potential changes to the scheme. \r\n",
    "Condition : 3 - A scheme for the sound insulation of the separating floor between the ground floor adult gaming centre use and any structurally adjoining residential units shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority. The scheme approved by the local planning authority shall be fully implemented in accordance with the approved details before the use, hereby permitted, commences. No alteration to the ceiling which undermines the integrity of the sound insulation shall be undertaken without the written consent of the local planning authority.  \r\nReason: To protect the amenity of nearby residents in accordance with policy LP2 of the Local Plan. \r\n",
    "Condition : 4 - Before any mechanical plant is used at the premises, a scheme shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority which demonstrates that the following noise criteria can be complied with and shall therefore be retained and operated as approved. \r\n\r\nThe cumulative measured or calculated rating level of noise emitted from mechanical plant and services to which the application refers, shall be 10dB(A) below the existing background noise level at all times that the plant operates. The measured or calculated noise levels shall be determined at the boundary of the nearest ground floor noise sensitive premises or 1 metre from the fa�ade of the nearest first floor (or higher) noise sensitive premises, and in accordance with the latest British Standard 4142. \r\n\r\nAn alternative position for assessment/measurement may be used to allow ease of access, which must be shown on a map and noise propagation calculations detailed to show how the design criteria is achieved.\r\n\r\nReason: To protect the amenity of nearby residents in accordance with policy LP2 of the Local Plan. \r\n"
