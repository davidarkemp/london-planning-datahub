    "Condition : 3 - All external materials used in the construction of the development hereby approved shall match the type, texture, tone, colour, size and profile of those used on the existing building and shall be retained permanently. \r\nReason: In the interest of the appearance of the development and to safeguard visual amenity, in accordance with Council policy LP1 of the Local Plan coupled with the requirements of the National Planning Policy Framework.\r\n",
    "Condition : 4 - Prior to occupation of the development the window in the western side elevation elevation at roof level of the development shall be obscure-glazed and non-opening (unless the parts of the window which can be opened are more than 1.7 metres above the floor of the room in which the window is installed).  The window shall so be maintained and retained as such. \r\nReason: To control overlooking and safeguard the privacy of neighbours in accordance with Council policy LP2 of the Wandsworth Local Plan (adopted August 2023) coupled with the requirements of the National Planning Policy Framework.\r\n",
    "Condition : 5 - INFORMATIVE: In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. The Council has made available detailed advice in the form of its statutory policies in the Local Plan (2023) as well as offering a full pre-application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably. In addition, where appropriate, further guidance was offered to the applicant during the processing of the application.",
    "Condition : 6 - INFORMATIVE: The developer must ensure that their proposal, both during construction and after completion does not:\r\n\r\n- encroach onto Network Rail land\r\n- affect the safety, operation or integrity of the company�s railway and its infrastructure\r\n- undermine its support zone\r\n- damage the company�s infrastructure\r\n- place additional load on cuttings\r\n- adversely affect any railway land or structure\r\n- over-sail or encroach upon the air-space of any Network Rail land\r\n- cause to obstruct or interfere with any works or proposed works or Network Rail development both now and in the future\r\n\r\nNetwork Rail strongly recommends the developer complies with the following comments and requirements to maintain the safe operation of the railway and protect Network Rail�s infrastructure.\r\r\n",
    "Condition : 7 - INFORMATIVE: The applicant must ensure that any construction and subsequent maintenance can be carried out to any proposed buildings or structures without adversely affecting the safety of/or encroaching upon\r\nNetwork Rail�s adjacent land and air-space. Therefore, any buildings are required to be situated at least 2 metres (3m for overhead lines and third rail) from Network Rail�s boundary.\r\n\r\nThis requirement will allow for the construction and future maintenance of a building without the need to access the operational railway environment. Any less than 2m (3m for overhead lines and third rail) and there is a strong possibility thatthe applicant(and any future resident)will need to utiliseNetwork\r\nRail land and air-space to facilitate works as well as adversely impact upon Network Rail�s maintenance teams� ability to maintain our boundary fencing and boundary treatments. Access to Network Rail�s land may not always be granted and if granted may be subject to railway site safety requirements and\r\nspecial provisions with all associated railway costs charged to the applicant.\r\n\r\nAs mentioned above, any works within Network Rail�s land would need approval from the Network Rail Asset Protection Engineer. This request should be submitted at least 20 weeks before any works are due to\r\ncommence on site and the applicant is liable for all associated costs (e.g. a l l possession, site safety, asset protection presence costs).

    "Condition : 9 - INFORMATIVE: Storm/surface water must not be discharged onto Network Rail's property or into Network Rail's culverts or drains except by agreement with Network Rail. Suitable drainage or other works must be provided and maintained by the Developer to prevent surface water flows or run-off onto Network Rail's property. Proper provision must be made to accept and continue drainage discharging from Network Rail's property; full details to be submitted for approval to the Network Rail Asset Protection Engineer. Suitable foul drainage must be provided separate from Network Rail's existing drainage. Soakaways, as a means of storm/surface water disposal must not be constructed within 20 metres of Network Rail's boundary or at any point which could adversely affect the stability of Network Rail's property. After the completion and occupation of the development, any new or exacerbated problems attributable to the new development shall be investigated and remedied at the applicants' expense.",
    "Condition : 10 - INFORMATIVE: Any scaffold which is to be constructed within 10 metres of the railway boundary fence must be erected in such a manner that at no time will any poles over-sail the railway and protective netting around such scaffold must be installed. The applicant/applicant's contractor must consider if they can undertake the works and associated scaffold/access for working at height within the footprint of their property boundary.",
    "Condition : 11 - INFORMATIVE: Where vibro-compaction/displacement piling plant is to be used in development, details of the use of such machinery and a method statement should be submitted for the approval of the Network Rail�s Asset Protection Engineer prior to the commencement of works and the works shall only be carried out in accordance with the approved method statement.\r",
    "Condition : 12 - INFORMATIVE: In view of the nature of the development, it is essential that the developer provide (at their own expense) and thereafter maintain a substantial, trespass proof fence along the development side of the existing boundary fence, to a minimum height of 1.8 metres. The 1.8m fencing should be adjacent to the railway boundary and the developer/applicant should make provision for its future maintenance and renewal without encroachment upon Network Rail land. Network Rail�s existing fencing / wall must not be removed or damaged and at no point during or post construction should the foundations of the fencing or wall or any embankment therein, be damaged, undermined or compromised in any way. Any vegetation within Network Rail�sland boundary must not be disturbed. Any fencing installed by the applicant must not prevent Network Rail from maintaining its own fencing/boundary treatment.\r\n",
    "Condition : 13 - INFORMATIVE: Any lighting associated with the development (including vehicle lights) must not interfere with the sighting of signalling apparatus and/or train drivers� vision on approaching trains. The location and colour of lights must not give rise to the potential for confusion with the signalling arrangements on the railway. The developers should obtain Network Rail�s Asset Protection Engineer�s approval of their detailed proposals regarding lighting.",
    "Condition : 14 - INFORMATIVE: The potential for any noise/vibration impacts caused by the proximity between the proposed development and any existing railway should be made aware to the future occupiers of the site. It must  also be assessed in the context of the National Planning Policy Framework which holds relevant national guidance information.\r\n\r\nThe current level of usage may be subject to change at any time without notification including increased frequency of trains, night-time train running and heavy freight trains. The appropriate building materials  should be used to reduce any potential noise disturbance from the railway.",
    "Condition : 15 - INFORMATIVE: Where a proposal calls for hard standing area/parking of vehicles area near the boundary with the operational railway, Network Rail would recommend the installation of a highways approved vehicle incursion barrier or high kerbs to prevent vehicles accidentally driving or rolling onto the railway or damaging lineside fencing.",
    "Condition : 16 - INFORMATIVE: Any trees/shrubs to be planted adjacent to the railway boundary these shrubs should be positioned at a minimum distance greater than their predicted mature height from the boundary. Certain broad leaf  deciduous species should not be planted adjacent to the railway boundary as the species will contribute to  leaf fall which will have a detrimental effect on the safety and operation of the railway. Network Rail wish  to be involved in the approval of any landscaping scheme adjacent to the railway. Any hedge planted  adjacent to Network Rail�s boundary fencing for screening purposes should be so placed that when fully  grown it does not damage the fencing or provide a means of scaling it. No hedge should prevent Network  Rail from maintaining its boundary fencing. If required, Network Rail�s Asset Protection team are able to  provide more details on which trees/shrubs are permitted within close proximity to the railway. \r\n",
    "Condition : 17 - INFORMATIVE: Whilst not a planning matter, we would like to remind the applicant of the need to identify and comply with  all existing rights on the land. Network Rail request all existing rights, covenants and easements are retained  unless agreed otherwise with Network Rail.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the above, if any property rights are required from Network Rail in order to deliver the development, Network Rail�s Property team will need to be contacted.
