    "Reason : 1 - By reason of design, siting, size and scale the development would form a prominent, unsympathetic and visually intrusive addition to the original building, streetscene and locality. The proposal would fail to physically integrate with the surroundings and detracts from the local spatial character and upsetting the symmetry of this terrace of properties. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policies LP1 and LP5 of the Wandsworth Local Plan (2023) and the Housing (2016).\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
