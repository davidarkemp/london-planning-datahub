    "Reason : 1 - The proposed advertisements, by reason of their scale, size and prominent location, would appear as overdominant and incongruous additions that would result in harm to the setting of the listed building and the visual amenity of the lcoal area. The proposals fail to comply with policies LP1, LP3 and LP9 of the Local Plan (2023), policy HC1 (C) of the London Plan (2021), the NPPF (2024) and Section 66 (1) of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990. \r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
