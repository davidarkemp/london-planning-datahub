    "Reason : 1 - The development, by reason of its scale, siting and design would\r\ndominate and compete with the original building and relate poorly to neighbouring properties being visually intrusive and incongruous in its setting. The proposal therefore fails to comply with policies LP1 and LP5 of the Wandsworth Local Plan (2023) and the guidance of the Wandsworth Housing SPD (2016).\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan and Supplementary Planning documents as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
