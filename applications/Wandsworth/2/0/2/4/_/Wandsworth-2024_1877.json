    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development would by reason of its scale, bulk and massing result in a top heavy and incongruous addition that would fail to maintain subservience to the host property and the character of the surrounding area.\r\nThe proposal therefore fails to comply with policies LP1, LP2, LP5 and LP6 of the Wandsworth Local Plan (2023), and the housing SPD.\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The development  by reason of its scale, massing and siting would cause undue harm to the amenity of surrounding residential occupiers in terms of being overbearing. \r\nThe proposal therefore fails to comply with policies LP1, LP2, LP5 and LP6 of the Wandsworth Local Plan (2023). \r\nRECOMMENDATION: REFUSE\r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably. In addition further guidance was offered to the applicant by the case officer during the processing of the application to identify amendments to address those elements of the scheme considered unacceptable. However, the necessary amendments to make the application acceptable are substantial and would materially change the development proposal. They would require further consultations to be undertaken prior to determination, which could not take place within the statutory determination period specified by the Department of Communities and Local Government. You are therefore encouraged to consider submission of a fresh application incorporating the material amendments set out below which are necessary to make the scheme acceptable. \r\n\r\nRequired amendments:\r\nReduce the size of the proposed basement and roof extensions to maintain subservience to the host property"
