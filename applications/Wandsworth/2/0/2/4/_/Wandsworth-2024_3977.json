    "Condition : 1 - Illumination for the proposed sign must remain below the limit set out in the Institute of Lighting Professionals (ILP) publication: \"The Brightness of Illuminated Advertisements including digital displays\" (PLG05/23, 2023).     \r\n \r\nTfL expects a maximum of 300 cd/m2 for after dark conditions when the advert is illuminated. For larger signs (greater than 20m2) in rural or suburban locations, maximum is 100 cd/m2 or 200 cd/m2 respectively.      \r\n\r\nFor lighting during the day, either no lighting, or maximum lighting levels (such as for digital displays) are set in accord with night-time maximums, or controlled so they comply with the guidance approach to ambient lighting. If not proposed in the application, this should be secured by condition.   \r\n\r\nThe minimum display time for each advertisement shall be 10 seconds, the use of message sequencing for the same product is prohibited and the advertisements shall not include features/equipment which would allow interactive messages/advertisements to be displayed.      \r\n\r\nThere shall be no special effects (including noise, smell, smoke, animation, exposed cold cathode tubing, flashing, scrolling, three dimensional, intermittent or video elements) of any kind during the time that any message is displayed. \r\nReason: In the interest of highway safety.     \r\n",
    "Condition : 2 - INFORMATIVE: The footway and carriageway on the A3 West Hill must not be blocked during the replacement/ installation of the digital screen. Temporary obstructions during the replacement/ installation must be kept to a minimum and should not encroach on the clear space needed to provide safe passage for pedestrians or obstruct the flow of traffic on the A3 West Hill. All vehicles associated with the replacement/ installation of the digital screen must only park/ stop at permitted locations and within the time periods permitted by existing on-street restrictions.  \r\n\r\nINFORMATIVE: No skips or construction materials shall be kept on the footway or carriageway on the TLRN at any time.   \r\n\r\nINFORMATIVE: All vehicles associated with the installation and maintenance of adverts must only park/ stop at permitted locations and within the time periods permitted by existing on-street restrictions.  \r\n    \r\nINFORMATIVE: Bus services and passengers waiting on the pavement should not be impacted during the replacement of the advertisement panel.\r\n"
