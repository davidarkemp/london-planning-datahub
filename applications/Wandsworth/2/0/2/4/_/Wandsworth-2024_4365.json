  "description": "TPO 504/2024 T1Cooper Beech & T2 Copper Beeach\r\nCrown Reduction: Reduce the crowns to the most recent reduction points, ensuring continuity by retaining selected shortened furnishing growth. Canopy Raising: Elevate the canopy to a height of 4.5 meters, removing tertiary branches only. Justification for Works: 1. Routine Maintenance: Essential to maintain clearance from the highway. Prevents mutual suppression between the trees, supporting healthy development and good form. Mitigates root activity to minimize damage to adjacent hardscaping. 2. Cyclical Pruning Requirements: Necessary to prevent direct damage caused by the trees growth. Addresses the constraints posed by the inadequate space available for the trees to reach their natural mature size. 3. Site-Specific Constraints: The trees are suppressed due to their restricted rooting environment. Their proximity to a retaining wall poses a risk of direct damage, further limiting their Safe Useful Life Expectancy in this location. Impact on Public Amenity: The proposed works will result in minimal loss of public amenity, as the overall retention of the trees ensures their continued contribution to the landscape. This proposal strikes a balance between maintaining public amenity and addressing the practical constraints imposed by the trees' current location and condition.",
