  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposal by way of combining six non-family-sized dwellings to create three family-sized dwellings would result in dwellings with a floorspace of greater than 130sqm each contrary to Local Plan Policy LP25 and London Plan Policy H8.",
    "Reason : 2 - In the absence of adequate boundary treatment details and heritage statement, the applicant has failed to demonstrate that the proposal would not cause harm to the nearby locally listed boundary marker contrary to paras 205, 206 and 208 of the NPPF as well as LP3 of the Local Plan",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed houses by reason of its highly cluttered and discordant design to the rear including inappropriate roof extension, terraces, and fenestration, and visibility from Wandsworth Common would result in an unacceptable and incongruous design failing to preserve the character of the conservation area and would result in less than substantial harm without adequate public benefits to outweigh this harm contrary to paras 205, 206 and 208 of the NPPF as well as LP3 of the Local Plan.",
    "Reason : 4 - The proposed balconies, by reason of their size, number, and siting as well as proximity to neighbouring boundaries without adequate mitigation would result in an unacceptable impact upon neighbouring properties causing potential harm to privacy and amenity of neighbours, in contravention of Policy LP2. ",
    "Reason : 5 - The proposed houses, due to their floor area, would provide oversized houses failing to achieve efficient use of land in contravention of Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021), para 3.6.2 ",
    "Reason : 6 - The proposed basement lightwell by reason of excessive depth within the front garden of the middle house, would fail to allow for adequate soft landscaping detrimental to the natural landscape and character of the area contrary to Local Plan Policy LP6. ",
    "Reason : 7 - In the absence of an adequate bat roost assessment, the applicant has failed to demonstrate that the proposal would not cause harm to protected species and would not have an adverse effect on the borough's species of importance contrary to Local Plan policy LP55.",
    "Reason : 8 - In the absence of an adequate arboricultural impact assessment and tree protection plan the applicant has failed in the submitted report to demonstrate that the development would provide adequate retention and protection of existing trees and insufficient evidence to demonstrate that provision has been made for the incorporation of new trees contrary to Local Plan (2023) policy LP56 and the NPPF (2023)",
    "Reason : 9 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal.",
    "Reason : 10 - INFORMATIVE: The applicant is advised that National Grid have submitted a holding objection to this scheme. The applicant is strongly advised to review this and resolve the relevant issues in conjunction with National Grid and come to a solution before any subsequent resubmission of a planning application.",
    "Reason : 11 - INFORMATIVE: In the absence of an adequate and accurate BNG report, the proposal fails to demonstrate achievement of a 10% uptake in biodiversity in line with the criteria set out in Biodiversity Net Gain under Schedule 7A of the Town and Country Planning Act (1990) (as inserted by Schedule 14 of the Environment Act (2021))"
