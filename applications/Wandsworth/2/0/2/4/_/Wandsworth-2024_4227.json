    "Reason : 1 - By reason of the scale, design and appearance, the proposed development would appear as a visually intrusive and unsympathetic addition to the host building and streetscene and thus would result in harm to the character and appearance of the Wandsworth Common Conservation Area with no public benefit to offset this. As such, the proposal would be contrary to Section 72(1) of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act (1990), the NPPF (2024), policies LP1, LP3 and LP5 of the Wandsworth Local Plan (2023) and the Housing SPD (2016).\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
