    "Reason : 1 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably. In addition further guidance was offered to the applicant by the case officer during the processing of the application to identify amendments to address those elements of the scheme considered unacceptable. However, the necessary amendments to make the application acceptable are substantial and would materially change the development proposal. They would require further consultations to be undertaken prior to determination, which could not take place within the statutory determination period specified by the Department of Communities and Local Government. You are therefore encouraged to consider submission of a fresh application incorporating the material amendments set out below which are necessary to make the scheme acceptable. \r\n\r\nRequired amendments:\r\nAmend the rear glazing to a size and style in line with the first floor windows.\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed variation would by reason of the size and style of glazing proposed give a bulky, unbalanced appearance to the dormer which would fail to maintain subservience to the host property. The proposal would be considered visually dominant in style and would result in harm to the character and appearance of the conservation area. No public benefit has been identified that would outweigh this harm.\r\nThe proposal therefore fails to comply with policies LP1, LP2, LP3 and LP5 of the Wandsworth Local Plan 2023, and the Housing SPD.\r\n"
