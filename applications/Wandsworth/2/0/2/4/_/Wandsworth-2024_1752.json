    "Reason : 2 - INFORMATIVE: The onus lies with the applicant to demonstrate that the use has existed for 4 years from the date of the application. The submitted information does not cover the whole four years ending with the date of the application. In addition, no certified statutory declaration/sworn affidavit was provided in order to provide more material weight to the application being made. You are advised to provide robust documentary evidence for the self-contained unit which focuses on the claim being made in terms of the relevant time period that needs to be demonstrated."
