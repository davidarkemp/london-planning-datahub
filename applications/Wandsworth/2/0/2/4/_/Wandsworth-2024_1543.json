    "Reason : 1 - The development would by reason of its scale, design and location be considered a visually incongruous and overly dominant addition that would harm the character and appearance of the host property and streetscene.  The proposal therefore fails to comply with policies LP1 and LP5 of the WLP (2023) and guidance within the Housing SPD (2016). ",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
