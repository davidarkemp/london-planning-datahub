    "Reason : 1 - By reason of its scale, design and siting, it is considered that the proposed roof addition would appear as a bulky and incongruous addition that would relate poorly to the scale, form and character of the existing property, causing harm to the appearance of the existing property and harm to the character and appearance of the conservation area. The proposal has no public benefits. The proposed development is therefore contrary to Local Plan Policies LP1, LP2, LP5 and LP3, London Plan Policy HC1 and NPPF paragraphs: 200, 205 and 208.",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
