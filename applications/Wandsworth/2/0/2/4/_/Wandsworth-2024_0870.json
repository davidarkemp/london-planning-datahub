    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development fails to be in accordance with policy LP7 of the Wandsworth Local Plan (2023), as the original dwelling has a floorspace of less than 130sqm, and the proposal would not provide an uplift in the number of family sized dwellings with direct access to a dedicated rear garden of at least 15sqm.",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed properties would both fall short of the required minimum space standards for two-storey, two-bedroom, three-person dwellings. The proposed end-of-terrace property also proposes an undersized single bedroom below 7.5sqm, and also fails to meet the minimum space standards for a two-storey, one-bedroom, two-person dwelling. The amenity space provided for the end-of-terrace property, house 2, would also fall short of the required 10sqm amenity space for 1- or 2-bedroom dwellings. The proposed development would therefore result in a poor standard of accommodation for future occupiers and fails to comply with policy LP27 of the Wandsworth Local Plan (2023).",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed development by reason of its scale, design and location within part of an undeveloped residential garden would be an inappropriate form of development. The development would infill the side garden space and extend past the established building line along Thurleigh Road resulting in harm to the appearance of the streetscene and local spatial character. The proposed car parking spaces would dominate the frontage area and contribute to the harm of local visual amenity. The proposal therefore fails to comply with policies LP1, LP5 and LP7 of the Wandsworth Local Plan (2023) and the Housing SPD (2015).",
    "Reason : 4 - The two proposed off street parking spaces to the front of the properties  would exceed the adopted London Plan maximum parking standard (Inner London, PTAL 3) of up to 0.25 spaces per dwelling. The proposal therefore fails to comply with policy LP51 of the Wandsworth Local Plan (2023) and the London Plan (2021).",
    "Reason : 5 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
