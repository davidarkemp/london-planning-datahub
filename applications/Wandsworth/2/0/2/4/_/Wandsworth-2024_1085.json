    "Reason : 1 - The proposed roof extension, by reason of its siting, scale and design, would constitute an incongruous and inappropriate form of development that would be unsympathetic to the existing property and the specific pattern of development within the terrace to which it forms part. The proposal would result in less than substantial harm to the character and appearance of the host property, the Battersea Bridge Road streetscene, and Battersea Park Conservation Area whilst failing to provide public benefits that would outweigh this harm. \r\n\r\nThe proposal would therefore be contrary to Section 72 (1) of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990, the NPPF (2023), policies LP1, LP3 and LP5 of the Wandsworth Local Plan (2023) and guidance within the Housing Supplementary Planning Document (2016) and the Battersea Park Conservation Area Appraisal and Management Strategy. \r\n\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
