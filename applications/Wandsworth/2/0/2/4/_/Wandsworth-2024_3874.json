    "Reason : 1 - The proposed conversion into a large HMO (sui generis) would result in the loss of a dwelling suitable for occupation by families as defined in Part A of Wandsworth Local Plan policy LP26, as the property as originally constrcuted is less than 130sqm in GIA. Accordingly, the development would result in harm to the provision of family housing within the borough and is contrary to Part A.1 of policy LP29 of the Wandsworth Local Plan (2023). ",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
