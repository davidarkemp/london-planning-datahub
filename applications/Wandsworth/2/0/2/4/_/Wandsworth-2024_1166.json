    "Reason : 1 - By reason of the loss of the existing storage facility (Class B8 use), the proposal would adversely affect the stock of for industrial land and premises within borough and the applicant has failed to demonstrate that there is no reasonable prospect of the site to continue to be used for the existing established storage purposes. The proposal therefore fails to comply with policy LP34 of the Wandsworth Local Plan (2023).\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - By reason of its scale and design, the proposed development would provide a substandard level of accommodation in terms undersized dedicated outdoor amenity space. Therefore, the proposal fails to accord with policy LP27 of the Wandsworth Local Plan (2023).\r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - By reason of its scale, siting and design, the proposed development would result in harm to neighbouring amenities in terms of increased overlooking and resulting actual and perceived loss of privacy. The proposal therefore fails to comply with policy LP2 of the Wandsworth Local Plan (2023).\r\n",
    "Reason : 4 - By reason for a lack of submitted evidence, the application has failed to demonstrate that the proposed dwelling would achieve BREEAM Domestic Refurbishment 'Outstanding' standard or demonstrate that this would not be technically feasible. Therefore, the proposal fails to comply with policy LP10 of the Wandsworth Local Plan (2023).\r\n",
    "Reason : 5 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan and Supplementary Planning documents, as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
