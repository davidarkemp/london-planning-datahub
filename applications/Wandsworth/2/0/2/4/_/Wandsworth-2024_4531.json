  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposal, by reason of its scale, design and location, would result in an unsympathetic and discordant form of development that would fail to integrate sympathetically with the character and appearance of the existing terrace to the harm of  local visual amenity. The development therefore fails to comply with policies LP1 and LP5 of the Wandsworth Local Plan (2023) and the Housing SPD (2016).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposal, due to the siting, scale and design of the increased building mass at the rear of the property, would result in an unneighbourly form of development that harms the amenity of the neighbouring occupiers in the form of loss outlook, being overbearing and creating an increased sense of enclosure. The application has also failed to demonstrate that there would not be unacceptable harm to neighbouring windows in respect to reductions in daylight and sunlight. As a result, the proposal conflicts with Policy LP2 of the Wandsworth Local Plan (2023), as well as the guidance set out in the Housing Supplementary Planning Document (2016).",
    "Reason : 3 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
