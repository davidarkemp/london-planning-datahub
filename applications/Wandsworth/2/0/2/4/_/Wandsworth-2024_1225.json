    "Reason : 1 - The development would by reason of its bulk and scale result in a visually intrusive and unneighbourly addition, which would be considered overbearing in nature and create an unsatisfactory outlook and sense of enclosure for neighbouring occupiers. The proposal therefore fails to comply with policy LP2 of the Wandsworth Local Plan (2023) and the guidance within the Housing SPD (2016).\r\n\r\n\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan and Supplementary Planning documents as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the scale and design of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
