    "Reason : 1 - The proposed front lightwell, by reason of its siting, scale and design would form a highly visible, over dominant, incongruous feature to the harm of the host property and streetscene while relating poorly and being harmful to the  character and appearance of the Clapham Common Conservation Area. As such, the application is considered contrary to the NPPF (2023), Policies LP1, LP3, LP5 and LP6 of the Wandsworth Local Plan and Housing SPD (2016).",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
