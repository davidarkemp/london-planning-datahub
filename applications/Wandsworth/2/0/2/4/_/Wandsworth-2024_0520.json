    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development, by reason of its scale, bulk and location would constitute an excessive and visually obtrusive form of development that would compete with and dominate the existing property causing unacceptable harm to the character and appearance of the terrace and wider area. The development would therefore fail to comply with policies LP1 and LP5 of the Wandsworth Local Plan (2023) and the Housing SPD (2016).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed development, by reason of its scale, design and location would result in an unneighbourly form of development that harms the amenity of the neighbouring occupiers in the form of loss outlook, being overbearing, creating an increased sense of enclosure. The proposal therefore fails to comply with policy LP2 of the Wandsworth Local Plan (2023) and the Wandsworth Housing SPD (2016).\r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
