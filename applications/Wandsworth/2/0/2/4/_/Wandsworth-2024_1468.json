    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development, by reason of its design and layout would fail to provide an acceptable standard of accommodation for the future occupiers. The ground floor flat would fail to meet minimum external amenity area standards and would have poor levels of outlook,  privacy and internal daylight/sunlight. The proposal is therefore contrary to policy LP27 of the Wandsworth Local Plan (2023), policy D3 of the London Plan (2023), the guidance within the Mayor of London's Housing Supplementary Planning Guidance (2023) and the Wandsworth Housing SPD (2016).",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
