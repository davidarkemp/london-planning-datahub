  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposal, by reason of design, scale and location would constitute an alien and incongruous form of development, on a prominent and sensitive junction.  The proposal would be visually intrusive and of a scale, massing and appearance which would fail to enhance local character.  It would not complement the form, setting, period or detailing of the host property, is not subservient and would be overly dominant. For the same reasons, the proposal would fail to preserve the character, appearance and significance of the Battersea Park Conservation Area. The proposal therefore fails to comply with the NPPF (2023), policies LP1, LP3 and LP5 of the Wandsworth Local Plan (2023) and the Housing SPD (2016). \r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed development, by reason of its design, scale and location would result in harm to the occupiers of the neighbouring property through loss of daylight to the rear first floor window. The proposal therefore fails to comply with policy LP2 of the Wandsworth Local Plan (2023) and the Housing SPD (2016). ",
    "Reason : 3 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably. In addition further guidance was offered to the applicant by the case officer during the processing of the application to identify amendments to address those elements of the scheme considered unacceptable. However, the necessary amendments to make the application acceptable are substantial and would materially change the development proposal. They would require further consultations to be undertaken prior to determination, which could not take place within the statutory determination period specified by the Department of Communities and Local Government.
