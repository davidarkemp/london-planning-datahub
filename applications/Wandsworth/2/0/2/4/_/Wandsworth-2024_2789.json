    "Reason : 1 - The proposed extension, by reason of its scale, bulk, design and location would represent an inappropriate form of development that would represent a visually intrusive and incongruous addition, thereby resulting in harm to the appearance of the host building and local spatial character. Accordingly, the proposed development is contrary to Wandsworth Local Plan policies LP1 and LP5 along with policies D3 and D4 of the 2021 London Plan (2021). \r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed extension, by reason of its scale and siting would be an unneighbourly form of development that would have a detrimental impact on the amenity of neighbouring properties and gardens in the form of a loss of outlook, and an increased sense of overbearing. The proposal has also failed to demonstrate that there would not be unacceptable harm to neighbouring properties in respect to reductions in daylight and sunlight. The proposed windows would also result in overlooking and loss of privacy to neighbouring occupiers, and the proposed terrace would be sufficiently large to potentially accommodate large and noisy gatherings.  The proposal is therefore contrary to policy LP2 of the Wandsworth Local Plan (2023) and the Housing SPD (2016).\r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed development would fail to provide a satisfactory standard of accommodation for future occupiers as Flat 05 would fail to meet nationally described minimum space standards and Flat 06 only has a single aspect layout and is located within close proximity to facing windows of Mellison Road properties to the harm of future occupiers privacy. The substandard accommodation would be contributed to by the lack of private amenity space.  The proposal therefore fails to comply with the policy requirements set out in policy LP27 of the Wandsworth Local Plan (2023), the London Plan (2021), and Nationally Described Space Standards (2015).",
    "Reason : 4 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
