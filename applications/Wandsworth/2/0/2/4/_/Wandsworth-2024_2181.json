    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development, due to its siting, scale and design, would result in unduly dominant and overbearing additions, that would fail to be subservient to and would detract from the character and appearance of the host property. The proposed development would unacceptably unbalance the composition and coherence of the group in which the property is set, resulting in harm to the character and appearance of this part of the Magdalen Park Conservation Area. There are no identifiable public benefits to outweigh the 'less than substantial' harm identified and the proposal therefore fails to satisfy policies LP1, LP3, and LP5 of the Local Plan (2023); the Housing SPD (2016); the Historic Environment SPD (2016) and the Magdalen Park Conservation Area Appraisal and Management Strategy, as well as the statutory duty of Section 72 (1) of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 and paragraphs 205 and 208 of the NPPF (2023).",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
