  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development fails to constitute as permitted development which requires prior approval from the local planning authority, per Schedule 2, Part 16, Class A of the General Permitted Development Order 2015 (as amended), as it has not been demonstrated that the developer has served notice on every person described in sub-paragraph (1) of A.3 of Part 16 of the GPDO (2015).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed telecommunications mast and associated equipment would by reason of its siting and appearance be of an overly dominant and visually intrusive scale and design, resulting in undue and excessive clutter in the open streetscene, harming the visual amenities and spatial character of the locality, and the setting of the Clapham Common Conservation Area and openness of the Metropolitan Open Land (Clapham Common). The proposal would not meet with the relevant conditions attached to the Class A of Part 16 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order and would be contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Section 72(1) of the Planning (Listed Building and Conservation Areas) Act 1990, policies SI6 and G3 of the London Plan (2021), policy IS3 of the Wandsworth Core Strategy (2016), policies DMS1, DMS2, DMO1 and DMS9 9 of the Wandsworth Development Management Policies Document (2016).",
    "Reason : 3 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
