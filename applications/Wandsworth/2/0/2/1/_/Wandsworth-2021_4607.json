    "Reason : 1 - The proposed telecommunications equipment would by reason of their siting and appearance be visually discordant, unsympathetic and of intrusive scale and design that would result in harm to the character and appearance of the host building and wider streetscape. The equipment would also result in an imposing and overbearing impact on the amenity of residents using the roof terrace.The proposal would not meet with the conditions attached to the relevant Class A of Part 16 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order and would be contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policy IS3 of the Wandsworth Core Strategy (2016), policies DMS1 and DMS9 of the Wandsworth Development Management Policies Document (2016).",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
