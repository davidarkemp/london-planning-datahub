    "Reason : 1 - The proposed amendment to the previously approved scheme would result  in the loss of significant original character features of the properties which it is considered provide a positive contribution to the Conservation area. The proposed alterations would cause significant harm to the character and appearance of the application property, the streetscene and the heriatge significance of the conservation area with no public benefit put forward to justify the loss, contrary to Section 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990, paragraph 196 of the NPPF (2019), Policy HC1 of the London Plan (2021) and Policies DMS1 and DMS2 of the DMPD.",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
