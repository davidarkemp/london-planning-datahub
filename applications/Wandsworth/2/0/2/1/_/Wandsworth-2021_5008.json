    "Reason : 1 - The development by reason of it is appearance, scale and siting represents a visually obtrusive and incongruous addition that relates poorly to the host building and is out of place with the prevailing character of shopfronts within the street. Furthemore, the shutters by reason of their coverage across the whole shopfront and visually impermeable nature would lack visual interest, failing to facilitate the establishment of an active frontage with visual integration between the host property and streetscene.Therefore, they fail to integrate with its surroundings and detracts from the local spatial character and Tooting Town Centre. The development is therefore contrary to policy IS3 of the Core Strategy (2016), policies DMS1 and DMTS9 of the Development Management Policies Document (2016) and the Shopfronts SPG (1988).\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - ENFORCEMENT ACTION:\r\nFor the reasons set out above it is considered expedient and in the public interest to initiate formal enforcement action to secure removal of the unauthorised alterations to the frontages of the property, including the roller shutter and associated framework. This action may consist of issue of an enforcement notice, prosecution proceedings and the taking of direct action pursuant to sections 172, 178 and 179 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended).\r\n",
