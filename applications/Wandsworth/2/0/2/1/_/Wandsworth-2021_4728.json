    "Condition : 1 - The development hereby permitted shall be begun within 3 years from the date of this permission.\nReason: To prevent the accumulation of unimplemented planning permissions and to comply with Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended) and to meet the requirements of Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004 and to meet the requirements of The Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015.\n",

    "Condition : 4 - Prior to occupation of the development the windows to first floor rooms of the development shall be obscure-glazed and non-opening (unless the parts of the window which can be opened are more than 1.7 metres above the floor of the room in which the window is installed).  The windows shall so be maintained and retained as such. \nReason: To control overlooking and safeguard the privacy of neighbours in accordance with Council policy DMS1(c) of the Development Management Policies Document (adopted March 2016) coupled with the requirements of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021.\n",

    "Condition : 7 - Prior to the first occupation of the development the cycle parking shown on approved drawing 605/80 shall be provided, and be retained for cycle parking purposes for the users of the development and for no other purpose.\nReason: To ensure adequate provision is made for cycle parking in accordance with Council policy DMT2 of the Development Management Policies Document (adopted March 2016) coupled with the requirements of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021.\n",
    "Condition : 8 - No development shall take place until a construction management plan is submitted to and approved by the local planning authority.  The construction management plan shall include details of the routing of construction vehicles, time of arrival and departure, and any proposed temporary traffic and pedestrian management measures during the course of construction.  The construction works shall be carried out in accordance with the approved plan.\nReason: In the interests of traffic, general amenity of the area and neighbour amenity in accordance with Council policy DMT1 of the Development Management Policies Document (adopted March 2016) coupled with the requirements of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021. It is necessary for the condition to be discharged prior to the commencement of any works on site to ensure the whole construction phase is in accordance with an approved plan.\n",
    "Condition : 9 - The development hereby approved shall achieve a minimum of a 19% reduction in CO2 emissions below the maximum threshold set in Building Regulations Part L 2013. Prior to first occupation of the development, evidence (e.g. photographs, copies of installation contracts and as-built worksheets prepared under SAP) shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority, to demonstrate that the development has achieved at least a 19% reduction in CO2 emissions below the maximum threshold set in Building Regulations Part L 2013.  The installed measures shall be retained in accordance with the approved details unless otherwise agreed by the local planning authority.\nReason: In the interest of sustainable development and to accord with Council policy DMS3 of the Development Management Policies Document (adopted March 2016) coupled with the requirements of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021.\n",
    "Condition : 10 - The development shall achieve a maximum water use of 105 litres per person per day (plus 5 litres for outside use) in line with the Water Efficiency Calculator for new dwellings from the Department of Communities and Local Government.

Measures integrated shall be retained for the lifetime of the development.\nReason: In the interest of sustainable development and to accord with Council policy DMS3 of the Development Management Policies Document (adopted March 2016) coupled with the requirements of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021.",
    "Condition : 11 - Prior to the first occupation of the development, the refuse and recycling storage shown on approved drawing 605/80 shall be provided and shall be retained for the users of the development and for no other purpose.\nReason: To ensure adequate provision is made for waste storage in accordance with Council policy DMS1 of the Development Management Policies Document (adopted March 2016) coupled with the requirements of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021.\n",
    "Condition : 12 - INFORMATIVE: In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework 2021 to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application.  The Council has made available detailed advice in the form of its statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning Documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre-application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably. In addition, where appropriate, further guidance was offered to the applicant during the processing of the application.  ",
    "Condition : 13 - INFORMATIVE: With regard to surface water drainage it is the responsibility of a developer to make proper provision for drainage to ground, water courses or a suitable sewer. In respect of surface water it is recommended that the applicant should ensure that storm flows are attenuated or regulated into the receiving public network through on or off site storage. When it is proposed to connect to a combined public sewer, the site drainage should be separate and combined at the final manhole nearest the boundary. Connections are not permitted for the removal of groundwater. Where the developer proposes to discharge to a public sewer, prior approval from Thames Water Developer Services will be required to ensure that the surface water discharge from the site shall not be detrimental to the existing sewerage system. They can be contacted on 0800 009 3921. ",
    "Condition : 14 - INFORMATIVE: Where a developer proposes to discharge groundwater into a public sewer, a groundwater discharge permit will be required. Groundwater discharges typically result from construction site dewatering, deep excavations, basement infiltration, borehole installation, testing and site remediation. Groundwater permit enquiries should be directed to Thames Water's Risk Management Team by telephoning 020 8507 4890 or by emailing wwqriskmanagement@thameswater.co.uk. Application forms should be completed on line via www.thameswater.co.uk/wastewaterquality. Any discharge made without a permit is deemed illegal and may result in prosecution under the provisions of the Water Industry Act 1991.",
    "Condition : 15 - INFORMATIVE: Thames Water will aim to provide customers with a minimum pressure of 10m head (approximately 1 bar) and a flow rate of 9 litres/minute at the point where it leaves Thames Waters pipes. The developer should take account of this minimum pressure in the design of the proposed development."
