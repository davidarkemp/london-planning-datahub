    "Reason : 1 - By reason of insufficient evidence provided, the applicant has failed to demonstrate that the unit has been vacant for a continuous period of at least 3 months immediately prior to the date of the application for prior approval. The proposal would therefore fail to meet the requirement  MA.1(1)(a)  of  Schedule 2, Part 3 Class MA of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "Reason : 2 - Insufficient evidence has been given to ensure that the existing/proposed internal floor space would be a minimum of 37sqm require to provide residential accommodation, and comply with the nationally described space standard issued by the Department for Communities and Local Government on 27th March 2015(1),  in line with  Paragraphs 9(A) and 9(B) of Article 3 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "Reason : 3 - By reason of a lack of an recent and adeqaute flood risk assessment, the development fails to demonstrate that the proposed change of use to a residential dwelling would not result in unacceptable flood risk for future occupiers for a ground floor property located within Flood Zone 3. The proposal therefore fails to comply with condition M.2.(1)(c) of Part 3, Class M, Schedule 2 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 2015 (as amended), policy SI12 of the London Plan (2021), policy PL 2 of the Wandsworth Core Strategy (2016) and policy DMS5 of the Wandsworth Development Management Policies Document (2016).",
    "Reason : 4 - The proposed development would be located on a busy parade and fails to demonstrate that the impact of noise from commercial premises on the intended occupiers of the development would be within acceptable parameters and not harm their residential amenity. Therefore, the proposed development fails to comply with Condition MA.2(d) of Part 3, Schedule 2 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended) and policy DMS1 of the Development Management Policies Document (2016)."
