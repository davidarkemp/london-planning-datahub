    "Condition : 1 - This notice indicates that the proposed development would comply with conditions MA.2 of Schedule 2 Part 3 Class MA of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 2015 (as amended) (\"the GPDO\"). \n\nIt is a requirement of condition MA.2(5) of the GPDO that the development must be completed within a period of 3 years starting with the prior approval date.\n\nIt is a requirement of condition MA.2(6) of the GPDO that any building permitted to be used as a dwellinghouse by virtue of Class MA is to remain in use as a dwellinghouse within the meaning of Class C3 of Schedule 1 to the Use Classes Order and for no other purpose, except to the extent that the other purpose is ancillary to the use as a dwellinghouse. \n\nIt is a requirement of paragraph W(12) of the GPDO that the development is carried out in accordance with the details provided in the application unless the developer and the local planning authority agree in writing.\n",
    "Condition : 2 - The development permitted by this planning permission shall only be carried out in accordance with the approved Flood Risk Assessment ( July 2021, S20-529/FRA/C, Southwest Environmental Limited)].\nThe mitigation measures, including the finished floor level of the sleeping accommodation (bedroom) being set no lower than 5.85 metres Above Ordnance Datum (mAOD), shall be implemented and retained as such. \nReason: To reduce the risk of flooding to the proposed development and future occupants, and third parties in accordance with policy DMS5 of the Development Management Policies Document (adopted March 2016) coupled with the requirements of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021.\n",
    "Condition : 3 - Prior to commencement of occupation, details of the location, number and design of secure and covered cycle parking shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority.  The cycle parking shall be provided in accordance with the approved details prior to the occupation of the development and be retained for cycle parking purposes for the users of the development and for no other purpose.\nReason: To ensure adequate provision is made for cycle parking in accordance with Council policy DMT2 of the Development Management Policies Document (adopted March 2016) coupled with the requirements of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021.\n",
    "Condition : 4 - INFORMATIVE: It should be noted that as the subject application forms part of Plantation Wharf where there have been a significant number of prior approval applications for the change to residential units, the development as a whole fulfils the criteria for being excluded from applying for permits to any such future Controlled Parking Zone operating in this area.\n",
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development, by reason of insufficient evidence, has failed to demonstrate that the levels of natural light to all habitable rooms for the new units would be acceptable and not detract from the living conditions of future occupiers. Therefore, the proposed development fails to comply with Condition MA.2(f) of Part 3, Schedule 2 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended) and policies DMS1 and DMH4 of the Development Management Policies Document (2016).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed development, by reason of insufficient evidence, has failed to demonstrate that the fire risks in relation to the building would not pose a threat to the safety of future occupiers. Therefore, the proposed development fails to comply with Condition MA.2(i) of Part 3, Schedule 2 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended)."
