    "Reason : 1 - The proposed building by reason if its form, siting and design would fail to provide a high-quality design that would contribute positively to the local spatial character, contrary to the provisions of policy DMS1 of the Development Management Policies Document (adopted March 2016).  ",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposal dwelling by reason of its siting and size would result in an unacceptable degree of enclosure and loss of outlook, contrary to the provisions of policy DMS1 of the Development Management Policies Document (adopted March 2016). ",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposal would provide a very poor standard of accommodation in terms of minimal levels outlook, contrary to the provisions of policy DMH4 of the Councils Development Management Policies Document (adopted 2016) and London Plan (adopted 2021) policy D6.  ",
    "Reason : 4 - The application site is located within flood risk zone 2 and basement bedrooms are proposal, contrary to the provisions of policy DMS5 of the Development Management Policies Document (adopted March 2016).  ",
    "Reason : 5 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
