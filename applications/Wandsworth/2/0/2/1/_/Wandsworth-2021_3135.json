    "Reason : 1 - The application has failed to demonstrate that the proposed opening hours would not result in the generation of unacceptable levels of noise and disturbance associated with the increased levels of commercial activity as well as customers and staff accessing and leaving the site during a normal period of respite from the day's activities. As such, the proposed development would result in unacceptable harm to the neighbouring residential uses and would fail to comply with policy DMS1 of the Development Management Policies Document (2016), policy IS4 of the Core Strategy (2016) and policies D13 and D14 of the London Plan (2021). ",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably. However, the necessary amendments to make the application acceptable are substantial and would materially change the development proposal. Should you consider the submission of a fresh application then it would be advisable to incorporate the additional information as set out below:\r\n\r\nSuggested amendments:\r\nA Noise Management Plan and Noise Impact Assessment could be provided to explore the feasibility of extended openings hours. You may wish to contact the Council's Environment Health Officer (Noise) (tel.020 8871 6127) to discuss the breadth of the assesment and management plans and understand these matters further. \r\n"
