  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The  proposed  Street  Hub  structure,  by  reason  of  its  scale,  design,  location,  size  and  the nature, number and scale of advertisement panels, would pose a potential distraction to road users  to  the  harm  of  public  safety  and  would  unacceptably  obstruct  the  public  footpath hindering the convenient and safe passage of pavement users. It would fail to comply with the Mayor�s  Vision  Zero  which  aims  to  eradicate  deaths  and  serious  injuries  from  London�s transport network. Furthermore, with five Street Hubs proposed within Tooting Town Centre it could  result  in  an  unnecessary  proliferation  of  the  structures  to  the  harm  of  visual  amenity. Whilst  the  proposal  would  result  in  some  facilities  for  the  general  public,  these  benefits  are lowand  do  not  outweigh  the  harm  identified.  The  proposal  fails  to  comply  with  the  NPPF, policies D3,D8, T2 and T4 of the London Plan (2021), and policies DMS1, DMS8, DMS9 and DMT1  of  the  DMPD  (2016).  It  would  also  fail  to  comply  with  policies  LP1,  LP9,  LP22,  LP49 and LP50 of the PVLP (2022).",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
