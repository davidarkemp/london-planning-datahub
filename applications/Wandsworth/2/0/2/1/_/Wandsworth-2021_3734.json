    "Reason : 1 - By reason of its design and siting, the rear first floor roof terrace constitutes an unneighbourly form of development that results in harm to the amenities of neighbouring occupiers through increased overlooking and significant loss of privacy. The development is therefore contrary to policies DMS1 and DMH5 of the Wandsworth Development Management Policies Document (2016) and Housing SPD (2016).",
    "Reason : 2 - By reason of its detailed design and siting at first floor level,  the rear first floor roof terrace with wooden balustrading, constitutes an unsympathetic and visually discordant  feature that fails to relate appropriately to the existing and neighbouring properties and harms the local spatial character. The development is therefore contrary to policies DMS1 and DMH5 of the Wandsworth Development Management Policies Document (2016) and Housing SPD (2016).\r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - ENFORCEMENT ACTION:\r\nFor the reasons set out above it is considered expedient and in the public interest to initiate formal enforcement action to secure the following:\r\n- Remove additional wall and railing balustrading.\r\n- Revert height of single-storey rear/side rear/side extension to previously approved under application ref: 2016/3999.\r\n- Replace rear first floor door with window as previously approved under application ref: 2016/3999.\r\nThis action may consist of issue of an enforcement notice, prosecution proceedings and the taking of direct action pursuant to sections 172, 178 and 179 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended). \r\n",
    "Reason : 4 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
