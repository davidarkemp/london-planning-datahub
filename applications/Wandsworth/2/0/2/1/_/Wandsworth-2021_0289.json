    "Reason : 1 - The proposed loss of the HMO is considered unacceptable, by reason of the lack of replacement HMO floorspace provided, insufficient evidence to demonstrate that the HMO facility no longer caters for current or future needs and insufficient evidence to demonstrate that it is no longer viable to continue use of the property as an HMO, contrary to Policies H9 of the London Plan (2021) and DMH9 of the DMPD (2016), as such facilities are considered to meet a specific need for low cost accommodation in the Borough and such a loss is considered detrimental to the housing stock in the Borough. ",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
