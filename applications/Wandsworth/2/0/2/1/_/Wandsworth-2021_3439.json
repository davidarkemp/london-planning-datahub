  "description": "Alterations including erection of roof extension above back addition to provide additional accommodation at fourth floor level  including spiral stair access to roof as means of escape.",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed roof extension, by reason of its style, scale, footprint, location and siting, would be an unsympathetic development which would cause less than substantial harm to the special historic and architectural character, appearance and significance of the host Grade II Listed Building and would have an undue design impact on the character and appearance of the host building and surrounding Putney Embankment Conservation Area. The proposal would lead to residential amenity implications in terms of overbearing, visual intrusion and sense of enclosure.\r\n\r\nThe proposal would fail to comply with paragraphs 199, 200 and 202 of the NPPF (2021), section 66 and 72 of the Town and Country Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990, policy HC1 (C) of the London Plan (2021), locally adopted policy IS3 of the Core Strategy (2016), policies DMS1, DMS2 and DMH5 of the Council's adopted DMPD (2016), the SPD 'Housing' (2016) and Putney Embankment Conservation Area Appraisal and Management Strategy.",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably. In addition further guidance was offered to the applicant by the case officer during the processing of the application to identify amendments to address those elements of the scheme considered unacceptable. However, the necessary amendments to make the application acceptable are substantial and would materially change the development proposal. They would require further consultations to be undertaken prior to determination, which could not take place within the statutory determination period specified by the Department of Communities and Local Government. You are therefore encouraged to consider submission of a fresh application incorporating the material amendments set out below which are necessary to make the scheme acceptable. \r\n\r\nRequired amendments:\r\n1. To reduce scale/footrprint of the proposed roof extension.\r\n2. To amend style/design of the proposed roof extenion so it appears as a fully glazed structure.\r\n3. To remove alterations to flank/rear elevation of the adjacent Grade II listed building, inlcuding the proosed brick wall. \r\n4. To provide detailed information/drawings/expertise on how the new roof extension and external staircase woudl be attached to a flank elevation of the adjacnet Gra"
