    "Reason : 1 - The proposed telecommunications mast and associated equipment would by\r\nreason of its siting and appearance be of an overly dominant, overbearing and visually intrusive scale and design, resulting in undue and excessive clutter in the open streetscene, harming spatial character of the locality including the setting and character of the adjoining Tooting Common Metropolitan Open Land and locally listed heritage asset. Furthermore, the discordant mast would harm the visual amenity of neighbouring residents. The proposal would therefore be contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policies D8, HC1 and SI6 of the London Plan (2021), policy IS3 of the Wandsworth Core Strategy (2016), policies DMS1, DMS2, DMS9 and DMO1 of the Wandsworth Development Management Policies Document (2016).\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
