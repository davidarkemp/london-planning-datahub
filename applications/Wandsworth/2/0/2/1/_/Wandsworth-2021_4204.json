  "description": "Alterations in connection with conversion of single dwellinghouse into 1 x 2 bedroom and 1 x 3 bedroom flats with associated off-street parking and cycle storage.",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The development would result in the conversion of a property consisting of less than 150sq.m of existing habitable floorspace (prior to any extensions carried out since end of 2008), which is not unsuitable for family accommodation. The proposal would therefore result in harm to the quality and mix of local housing stock within the borough and would fail to comply with policy DMH2 of the Development Management Policies Document (2016).\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposal fails to provide a family sized unit with a double bedroom that meets minimum size standards and in conjunction with the inconvenient and disjointed access to private garden space at the rear of the property results in an overall substandard level of accommodation for future occupiers. Therefore, the development would not be in compliance with policies DMH4, DMH6 and DMH7 of the Development Management Policies Document (2016) and  the Technical Housing Standards - nationally described space standards (2015). ",
    "Reason : 3 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
