As such, the proposal would fail to comply with Class A.1(e), Part 20, Schedule 2 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 2015 (GDPO) as amended.",
    "Reason : 2 - In the absence of a Flood Risk Assessment, Sequential and Exception tests it has not been demonstrated that the proposal would be an appropriate form of development at this location and would not be at risk from flooding or result in increased risk of flooding in the surrounding area.  As such, the proposal would fail to comply with Class A.2(1)(d), Part 20, Schedule 2 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 2015 (GDPO) as amended, in addition to the NPPF (2021) and policy DMS5 of the Development Management Policies Document (2016).\r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed development by reason its appearance, design, scale and height would constitute a prominent, discordant and inappropriate form of development, which would appear overly dominant to the harm of the character and appearance of the host property and streetscene. As such, the proposal would fail to comply with Class A.2(1)(e), Part 20, Schedule 2 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 2015 (GDPO) as amended, in addition to the NPPF (2021), policy IS3 of the Core Strategy (2016), policy DMS1 of the Development Management Policies Document (2016) and the guidance within the Housing SPD (2016).",
    "Reason : 4 - The proposal by reason its scale, design and siting would constitute an unneighbourly form of development, that would have a detrimental impact on the amenity of neighbouring properties in the form of loss outlook, being overbearing and creating an increased sense of enclosure. The proposals have also failed to demonstrate that there would not be unacceptable harm to neighbouring windows in respect to reductions in daylight and sunlight. As such, the proposal would fail to comply with Class A.2(1)(g), Part 20, Schedule 2 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 2015 (GDPO) as amended, in addition to the NPPF (2021) and policy DMS1 of the Development Management Policies Document (2016) and the guidance within the Housing SPD (2016).
