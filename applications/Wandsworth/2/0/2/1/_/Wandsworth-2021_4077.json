    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development by reason of its bulk, scale, design and siting would cause undue harm to the character and appearance of the building, the semi-detached pair of buildings of which it forms part, the streetscape and the heritage significance of the West HIll Road conservation area.\r\nThe proposal therefore fails to comply with the NPPF, policies D3 and HC1 of the London Plan, policies PL1 and IS3 of the Core Strategy (2016), policies DMS1, DMS2 and DMH5 of the Development Management Policies Document (2016), and the Housing Supplementary Planning Document (2016).",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
