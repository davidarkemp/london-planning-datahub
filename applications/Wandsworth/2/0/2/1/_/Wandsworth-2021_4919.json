    "Condition : 1 - The development hereby permitted shall be begun within 3 years from the date of this permission.\r\nReason: To prevent the accumulation of unimplemented planning permissions and to comply with Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended) and to meet the requirements of Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004 and to meet the requirements of The Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015.\r\n",
    "Condition : 2 - The development shall be carried out in accordance with the reports, specifications and drawings detailed ST_OCT 21_152 UPP_02A. \r\nReason: To ensure a satisfactory standard of development and to allow the local planning authority to review any potential changes to the scheme. \r\n",
    "Condition : 3 - All external materials used in the construction of the development hereby approved shall match the type, texture, tone, colour, size and profile of those used on the existing building and shall be retained permanently. Brickwork shall be built in a matching bond using lime mortar and the pointing shall be flush and rag-finished.\r\nReason: In the interest of the appearance of the development and to safeguard visual amenity of the conservation area, in accordance with Council policies DMS1 and DMS2 of the Development Management Policies Document (adopted March 2016) coupled with the requirements of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021.\r\n",
    "Condition : 4 - INFORMATIVE: In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework 2021 to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application.  The Council has made available detailed advice in the form of its statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning Documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre-application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably. In addition, where appropriate, further guidance was offered to the applicant during the processing of the application.  ",
    "Condition : 5 - INFORMATIVE: The site of the alteration works is on the A205 Upper Richmond Road, which forms part of the Transport for London Road Network (TLRN). Transport for London is the highway authority for the TLRN, and is therefore concerned about any proposal which may affect the performance and/or safety of the TLRN.\r\nThe footway and carriageway on the A205 Upper Richmond Road must not be blocked during the alteration works. Temporary obstructions during the alteration works must be kept to a minimum and should not encroach on the clear space needed to provide safe passage for pedestrians or obstruct the flow of traffic on the A205 Upper Richmond Road.\r\nAll vehicles associated with the alteration works must only park/stop at permitted locations and within the time periods permitted by existing on-street restrictions.\r\nNo skips or construction materials shall be kept on the footway or carriageway on the TLRN at any time. Should you wish to install scaffolding or a hoarding on the footway whilst undertaking the alteration works, separate licences may be required from Transport for London. Please see https://www.tfl.gov.uk/info-for/urban-planning-and-construction/highway-licences."
