    "Reason : 1 - The proposed external staircase by reason of its location and design represents an unneighbourly form of development that enables users of the staircase to overlook into the rear garden and windows of 2a Mandrake Road and 1 Fircroft Road to the harm of privacy. The staircase also unacceptably impedes upon the safety and security of neighbouring occupiers. Therefore, the proposal fails to comply with policies DMS1(c) and DMS1(j) of Wandsworth's Development Management Policies Document (2016) and Policy D11 of the London Plan (2021). ",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
