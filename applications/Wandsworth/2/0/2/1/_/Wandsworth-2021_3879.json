  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The development would by reason of its design, scale and bulk result in a highly prominent and visually dominant addition that would fail to retain a subservient relationship with no. 177 Battersea Bridge Road and would relate inappropriately to the existing property and the terrace it forms part of. Accordingly, the development would result in unacceptable harm to the streetscene and the character and appearance of the Battersea Park Conservation Area. The proposal therefore fails to comply with policy HC1 of the London Plan (2021) and policies DMS1, DMS2 and DMH5 of Wandsworth's Development Management Policies Document (2016) and Wandsworth's Housing SPD 2016).\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The development would by reason of its height, scale and positioning would result in an unduly overbearing addition that would foster an increased sense of enclosure and result in harm to neighbouring outlook. The proposal therefore fails to comply with policy DMS1 of Wandsworth's Development Management Policies Document (2016). \r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
