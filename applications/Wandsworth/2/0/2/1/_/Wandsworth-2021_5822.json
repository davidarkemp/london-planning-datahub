  "description": "Installation of external metal staircase from first floor flat to access the garden at rear.",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed external staircase by reason of its scale, design and siting would constitute an unneighbourly form of development that would have harmful impact on neighbouring amenity in terms of privacy, outlook, noise and disturbance.  The application has also failed to demonstrate that the structure would not significantly harm access to daylight and sunlight in respect to the ground floor dwelling.  As such, the proposal would fail to accord with policy DMS1 of the Development Management Policies Document (2016) and the guidance within the Housing SPD (2016).\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
