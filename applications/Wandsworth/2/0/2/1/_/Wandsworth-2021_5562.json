    "Reason : 1 - The proposal, by reason of its location and scale encroaching on a significant proportion of existing residential garden within its setting, would not be an appropriate form of development where national, regional and local planning policies makes presumption against such development due to the harm to the local spatial character that would occur, as in this case.\r\nFurthermore, by reason of its scale, form, siting and appearance, the proposed development would form a prominent and incongruous feature that would result in a harmful impact to the character and appearance of the surrounding area, including the open rear garden setting of adjoining properties along this section of Longley Road. The proposed development would conflict with the NPPF (2021), policy D3 of the London Plan (2021), policies PL1 and IS3 of the Core Strategy (2016) and policies DMS1, DMS2 and DMH4 of the Wandsworth Development Management Policies Document (2016) and the Wandsworth Housing SPD (2016).\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed residential development, by reason of its scale, design and proximity to the boundary with the neighbouring properties would be an unneighbourly form of development that would result in harm to the visual amenities of adjoining occupiers by being intrusive and visually overbearing. The proposal therefore fails to comply with policy D6 of the London Plan (2021), policies DMS1 and DMH4 of the Development Management Policies Document (2016), and the Wandsworth Housing SPD (2016).\r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - By reason of the scale of the development and the absence of appropriately designed cycle storage for the majority of units, it has not been demonstrated that the proposal would have sufficient cycle parking for future occupiers at this location. The proposal is therefore contrary to the NPPF (2021), policy T5 of the London Plan (2021) and policy DMT2 of the Development Management Policies Document (2016).",

The proposal is therefore contrary to the NPPF (2021), policy T5 of the London Plan (2021) and policy DMT2 of the Development Management Policies Document (2016).",
    "Reason : 4 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably. In addition further guidance was offered to the applicant by the case officer during the processing of the application to identify amendments to address those elements of the scheme considered unacceptable. However, the necessary amendments to make the application acceptable are substantial and would materially change the development proposal. They would require further consultations to be undertaken prior to determination, which could not take place within the statutory determination period specified by the Department of Communities and Local Government. \r\n"
