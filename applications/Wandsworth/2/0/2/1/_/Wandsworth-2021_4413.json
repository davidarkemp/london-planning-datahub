  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - By reason of its size, scale, and design the proposals would constitute an unsympathetic and incongruous form of development in this prominent and sensitive corner location. The proposals would harm the character of the existing building and would relate poorly to the Belleville Road street frontage and corner properties on the junction of Belleville Road and Northcote Road. Furthermore, the development would fail to preserve the setting of the Wandsworth Common Conservation Area. The development would therefore be contrary to the policies DMS1, DMS2 and DMH5 of the Development Management Policies Document (2016), policy IS3 of the Core Strategy (2016) the National Planning Policy Framework (2021) and the guidance provided in the Housing SPD (2016).\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
