    "Reason : 1 - The proposed ground floor extension by reason of its siting, scale and design would result in an inappropriate and prominent addition, which would relate poorly to the host and neighbouring properties. The proposal would result in less than substantial harm to the character and appearance of the host property, Franciscan Road and Derinton Roads streetscene, and the Totterdown Fields Conservation Area whilst failing to provide public benefits that would outweigh the harm. The proposal would be contrary to policies PL1 and IS3 of the Core Strategy (2016), polcies DMS1, DMS2 and DMH5 of the Development Management Policies Document (2016), the guidance within the Housing Supplementary Planning Document (2016) and the NPPF (2021).",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably. In addition further guidance was offered to the applicant by the case officer during the processing of the application to identify amendments to address those elements of the scheme considered unacceptable. However, the necessary amendments to make the application acceptable are substantial and would materially change the development proposal. They would require further consultations to be undertaken prior to determination, which could not take place within the statutory determination period specified by the Department of Communities and Local Government. You are therefore encouraged to consider submission of a fresh application incorporating the material amendments set out below which are necessary to make the scheme acceptable. \r\n\r\nRequired amendments: The rear extension should not project further than the\r\nestablished building line of the existing side elevation. \r\n"
