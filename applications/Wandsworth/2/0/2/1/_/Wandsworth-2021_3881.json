  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - By reason of the insensitive and unnecessary siting of the proposed rooflights, the development would be an incongruous and visually intrusive addition to the original property. The proposed development would visually unbalance the pair of mansion properties and would fail to physically integrate with the architectural integrity and appearance of the host property and its surroundings. The proposed development would therefore be contrary to Section.72(1) of the Planning (LBCA) Act 1990, the NPPF (2021), the London Plan (2021), policies PL1 and IS3 of the Core Strategy (2016), policies DMS1, DMS2, DMH4 and DMH5 of the Council's Development Management Policies Document (2016), the Supplementary Planning Document: Housing (2016) and the Nightingale Lane Conservation Area Appraisal & Management Strategy (2007).\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed development, by reason of its scale and design, would present a substandard level of accommodation, with cramped living conditions and restricted outlook into key habitable rooms. The proposal would therefore be contrary the Technical Housing Standards- Nationally Described Space Standard (2015) and policies DMS1, DMS4 and DMH6 of the Council's Development Management Policies Document (2016), the Supplementary Planning Document: Housing (2016).",
