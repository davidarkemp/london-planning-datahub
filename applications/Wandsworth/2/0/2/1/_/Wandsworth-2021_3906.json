  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed telecommunications equipment would, by reason of its siting and appearance, be overly prominent, unsympathetic and of intrusive scale and design, resulting in a visually overbearing addition to the streetscape and excessive clutter, causing unacceptable harm to the setting of the adjacent Grade II* Listed building and failing to preserve or enhance the character and appearance of the surrounding Wandsworth Common Conservation Area, whilst having the potential to cause harm to existing trees adjacent to the site. The proposal would not meet with the relevant conditions attached to Class A of Part 16 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order and would be contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policies SI6 of the London Plan (2021), policy IS3 of the Wandsworth Core Strategy (2016), policies DMS1, DMS2, DMS9 and DMO1 of the Wandsworth Development Management Policies Document (2016).",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
