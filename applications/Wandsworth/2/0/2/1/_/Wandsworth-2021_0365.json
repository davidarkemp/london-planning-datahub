    "Reason : 1 - The proposed extensions, due to their form, scale and appearance, would be unduly dominant and visually obtrusive additions detrimental to the appearance of the host property and its setting, contrary to policies DMS1 and DMH5 of the Development Management Policy Document (adopted March 2016) and the advice within the adopted Housing Supplementary Planning Guidance (adopted November 2016). ",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably. In addition further guidance was offered to the applicant by the case officer during the processing of the application to identify amendments to address those elements of the scheme considered unacceptable. However, the necessary amendments to make the application acceptable are substantial and would materially change the development proposal. They would require further consultations to be undertaken prior to determination, which could not take place within the statutory determination period specified by the Department of Communities and Local Government. You are therefore encouraged to consider submission of a fresh application incorporating the material amendments set out below which are necessary to make the scheme acceptable. \r\n\r\nRequired amendments:\r\nReduce extent and form of raised ridge height by continuing front roofslope back in the same plane; reduce width of main reaar roof extension and set within a 70-degree mansard slope; reduce length of second floor extension to no more than half the length of the back addition and replace vertical faces with 70-degree mansard slopes to side and rear of extension. \r\n"
