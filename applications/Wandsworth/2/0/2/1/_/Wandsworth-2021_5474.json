  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed mast and equipment would collectively, by reason of their scale, siting and design, constitute an obtrusive and incongruous addition that would result in an undue adverse impact on the visual amenity of the streetscene, heritage significance of the conservation area and would adversely impact on the openness of the MOL. The equipment would constitute a safety hazard in the form of obstruction to the free flow of pedestrians and would result in a distraction to drivers within this area, especially bus drivers, resulting in risk to pedestrians and other vulnerable road users in this location.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the proposal fails to provide an acceptable siting and design contrary to Part 16 of the GPDO 2015 (as amended), National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policies D8, HC1 and SI6 of the London Plan (2021), policy IS3 of the Wandsworth Core Strategy (2016), policies DMS1, DMS2, DMS9 and DMO1 of the Wandsworth Development Management Policies Document (2016).\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
