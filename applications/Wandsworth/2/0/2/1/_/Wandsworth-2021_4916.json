    "Reason : 1 - The proposed extension by reason of its scale, form and siting would be an inappropriate and incongruous addition that would cause undue harm to the character and appearance of the application site, the streetscene and the heritage significance of the conservation area.  The proposed development would cause less than substantial harm to the character and appearance of the conservation area, with no public benefit outlined that it is considered would be sufficient to outweigh this harm, contrary to  Section 72(1) of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990, the NPPF, polices DMS1, DMS2 and DMH5 of the DMPD and policy HC1 of the London Plan.",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
