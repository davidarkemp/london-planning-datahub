    "Reason : 1 - The proposed telecommunications equipment would result in excessive street clutter which would unacceptably narrow the pavement resulting in potential obstruction to the free movement of pedestrians and cyclists and would be likely to impede future improvements to the area. The proposal would therefore fail to meet the conditions attached to the relevant Class A of Part 16 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order and would be contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policy IS3 of the Wandsworth Core Strategy (2016), policies DMS1 and DMS9 of the Wandsworth Development Management Policies Document (2016)."
