    "Reason : 1 - The proposed rear roof extension by reason of its size, location and design would result in an unsympathetic and incongruous addition to the host dwelling resulting in less than substantial harm to the Wandsworth Common Conservation Area without public benefits to outweigh this harm. The proposal would therefore fail to accord with the statutory duty of the 1990 Act, paragraphs 190, 200 and 202 of the NPPF (2021), policies IS3 of Core Strategy (2016) and policies DMS1, DMS2 and DMH 5 of the DMPD (2016) in addition to the guidance set out within the Housing SPD (2016) and the Wandsworth Common Conservation Area Appraisal. ",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably. In addition further guidance was offered to the applicant by the case officer during the processing of the application to identify amendments to address those elements of the scheme considered unacceptable. However, the necessary amendments to make the application acceptable are substantial and would materially change the development proposal. They would require further consultations to be undertaken prior to determination, which could not take place within the statutory determination period specified by the Department of Communities and Local Government. You are therefore encouraged to consider submission of a fresh application incorporating the material amendments set out below which are necessary to make the scheme acceptable. \r\n\r\nRequired amendments:\r\n- Amend to smaller rear dormer in accordance with SPD guidance \r\n"
