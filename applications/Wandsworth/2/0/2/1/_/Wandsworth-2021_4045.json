  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposal, by reason of its style, scale, location, siting and mass/bulk, would be an unsympathetic and incongruous development which would have an undue adverse design impact on the character and appearance of the host building, streetscene and surrounding area. The proposal would result in less than substantial harm to the setting of the Grade II listed building and cause harm to the significance of the adjacent Grade II listed building and its special architectural and historic interest.   \r\nThe proposal would be contrary to section 2, 12 and 16 of the NPPF (2021), section 66 (1) of the Town and Country Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990, policy HC1 (C) of the London Plan (2021), locally adopted policies such as policy IS3 of the Core Strategy (2016), policies DMS1 and DMH5 of the Council's adopted DMPD (2016), and the SPD 'Housing' (2016). \r\n\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposal would worsen the existing conditions on site for neighbouring occupiers of properties at no.  2 and no. 3 Eden Court in terms of overbearing and visual intrusion, it would have an adverse impact at no. 1 Eden Court in terms of loss of light, sense of enclosure, overbearing, visual intrusion, loss of vertical sky component and loss of ventilation to the flat, and undue impact at flats of no. 59 Standen Road in terms of overbearing and visual intrusion.  The proposal would be contrary to the Council's develoment plan policies, in particular, policy DMS1 and Housing SPD 2016. \r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
