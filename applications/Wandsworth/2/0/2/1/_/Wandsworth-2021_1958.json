  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed rear canopy structure by reason of its scale, siting and materials would constitute an unsightly and incongruous addition that would cause undue harm to the visual amenity and character of the existing property and the wider conservation area, contrary to Policies DMS1 and DMS2 of the DMPD, Policy HC1 of the London Plan and the NPPF. ",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed rear canopy strucrure would be likely to result in the intensification of the use of the rear courtyard would be expected cause undue adverse noise disturbance for neighbouring residents, in significant detriment to neighbour amenity, contrary to Policy DMS1 of the DMPD. ",
    "Reason : 3 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
