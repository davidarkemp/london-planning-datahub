    "Condition : 3 - All external materials used in the construction of the development hereby approved shall match the type, texture, tone, colour, size and profile of those used on the existing building and shall be retained permanently. \nReason: In the interest of the appearance of the development and to safeguard visual amenity, in accordance with Council policy DMS1 of the Development Management Policies Document (adopted March 2016) coupled with the requirements of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021.",
    "Condition : 4 - The development shall achieve a maximum water use of 105 litres per person per day (plus 5 litres for outside use) in line with the Water Efficiency Calculator for new dwellings from the Department of Communities and Local Government. Prior to first occupation, evidence to demonstrate that that the internal water consumption of the development will not exceed 105l/p/day must be submitted to the local planning authority and approved in writing, unless otherwise agreed in writing by the local planning authority. Measures integrated shall be retained for the lifetime of the development.\nReason: In the interest of sustainable development and to accord with Council policy DMS3 of the Development Management Policies Document (adopted March 2016) coupled with the requirements of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021.",
    "Condition : 5 - Prior to occupation, an operational waste and recycling strategy shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority. The submitted operational waste and recycling strategy shall include details of the arrangements for storage and collection of waste from the development. The measures detailed in the approved operational waste and recycling strategy shall be installed prior to first occupation of the development and operated and maintained in accordance with the approved operational waste and recycling strategy in perpetuity.\nReason: To ensure adequate refuse storage is provided on site and can be readily collected, to accord with Council policies DMS1 and DMT2 of the Development Management Policies Document (adopted March 2016) coupled with the requirements of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021.",

    "Condition : 7 - INFORMATIVE: In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework 2021 to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application.  The Council has made available detailed advice in the form of its statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning Documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre-application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably. In addition, where appropriate, further guidance was offered to the applicant during the processing of the application.",
    "Condition : 8 - INFORMATIVE: Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL): From the information available, it appears that the development permitted is subject to a Community Infrastructure Levy charge in accordance with the Community Infrastructure Levy Regulations 2010 (as amended) (the \"Regulations\"). \nYou or the relevant interested parties are required to provide the Council with the information set out in the Regulations. This process for the collection of CIL includes:  the requirement to complete an \"Assumption of Liability\" form as soon as possible;  in order to claim charitable exemption or social housing relief or other forms of relief you or the relevant interested party should also complete a \"Claiming Exemption or Relief\" form. \nThe Council will, if appropriate, then issue a Liability Notice(s) which details the charges due. As soon as the developer, landowner or other interested party(ies) is aware of the date when development is going to start they must also submit a \"Commencement Notice\".  Failure to comply with the Regulations, including failure to complete the forms when required or providing inaccurate information can lead to surcharges or other penalties as set out in the Regulations. It can also mean that any exemptions or reliefs are lost.\nGeneral information on the Community Infrastructure Levy, including the forms mentioned above can be found on the Planning Portal (www.planningportal.gov.uk). Details of the Mayoral CIL can be found on the GLA and TfL websites (www.london.gov.uk and www.tfl.gov.uk). The Assumption of Liability Form, Claiming of Exemption or Relief Form and Commencement Notice must be sent to: Community Infrastructure Levy Environment and Community Services Wandsworth Council Town Hall London SW18 2PU cil@wandsworth.gov.uk Fax: 020 8871 6003 (marked FAO CIL)",
    "Condition : 9 - INFORMATIVE: Any assessment of CIL liability by the Council has been based on the information provided. The assessment of CIL liability referred to in this informative is indicative only and is not intended to provide a binding estimate of the actual CIL liability likely to be incurred.  The assessment of the actual CIL liability will be provided pursuant to and in accordance with the Community Infrastructure Levy Regulations 2010 (as amended).  Where the calculation of CIL liability includes taking account of the existing use of a building, CIL liability may change if the information provided in relation to the existing use(s) of buildings, is not still current at the time of the decision which first permits development."
