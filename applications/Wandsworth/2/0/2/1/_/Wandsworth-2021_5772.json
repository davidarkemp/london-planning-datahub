  "description": "Alterations including erection of two-storey extension to main roof; erection of a part single, part-four, part-five storey rear/side extension, with French doors and safety railings to the second and third floor rear elevation; formation of roof terraces at rear first and fourth floor levels in connection with change of use from 6-bed HMO (Class C4) to 11-bed HMO (Class Sui Generis) including retention of commercial unit to front part of ground floor.",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - \r\nThe proposed development, by reason of its siting, scale, massing and form, would be an inappropriate and unneighbourly over-development, resulting in the provision of unduly dominant additions that would relate poorly to and overwhelm the host property and its setting within the streetscape, and would fail to preserve or enhance the character. appearance and Heritage significance of the Wandsworth Town Conservation Area. The proposal also fails to demonstrate adequate arrangements for cycle parking and refuse storage, contrary to policies IS3 of the Core Strategy (March 2016); DMS1; DMS2, DMH5 and DMT2 of the Development Management Policies Document (March 2016) and the Housing SPD (November 2016), the Refuse and Recyclables SPD (February 2014), coupled with the requirements of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021.",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
