  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The development, by reason of insufficient supporting detail, in conjunction with inappropriate materials and design, would cause harm to the character and appearance of the locally listed host site, the Clapham Common Conservation Area and the Metropolitan Open Land, to which no compelling justification in providing evidence of the very special circumstances to overcome the harm identified have been produced. The proposal therefore fails to comply with Section 72 of the Planning (Listed Building and Conservation Area Act (1990), the NPPF (2021), the London Plan (2021), policies DMS1, DMS2 and DMO1 of the Wandsworth Development Management Policies Document (2016) and the Clapham Common Conservation Area Appraisal and Management Strategy (2007).\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The development, by reason of its insufficient detail and design, would cause harm to public visual amenity and the amenities of neighbouring residential occupiers in relation to light pollution. The proposal therefore fails to comply with policy DMS1 of the Wandsworth Development Management Policies Document (2016).\r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - By reason of its insufficient detail, design and scale, the development would cause harm to local wildlife, trees and biodiversity. The proposal therefore fails to comply with policy DMS1, DMO4 and DMO5 of the Wandsworth Development Management Policies Document (2016).\r\n",
    "Reason : 4 - By reason of a lack of a fire safety stragtegy, the applicant has failed to submit sufficient evidence that fire safety risks have duly been accounted for and would not harm future users of the facility and public users of the adjoining wider MOL. The proposal therefore fails to comply with policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\n",
    "Reason : 5 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably. In addition further guidance was offered to the applicant by the case officer during the processing of the application to identify amendments to address those elements of the scheme considered unacceptable. However, the necessary amendments to make the application acceptable are substantial and would materially change the development proposal. They would require further consultations to be undertaken prior to determination, which could not take place within the statutory determination period specified by the Department of Communities and Local Government."
