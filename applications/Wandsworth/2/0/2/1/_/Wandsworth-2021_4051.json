  "decision_conditions": [
    "Condition : 1 - The development hereby permitted shall be begun within 3 years from the date of this permission.\r\nReason: To prevent the accumulation of unimplemented planning permissions and to comply with Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended) and to meet the requirements of Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004 and to meet the requirements of The Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015.\r\n",
    "Condition : 2 - The development shall be carried out in accordance with the reports, specifications and drawings detailed [Location plan, 201, 202, 203 Rev A, 204 Rev A, 205 Rev A, 206, 207, 208 Rev B, 209 Rev C, 210 Rev A, 211, 212 Rev A, planning fire safety strategy (received on 01/09/2021)].\r\nReason: To ensure a satisfactory standard of development and to allow the local planning authority to review any potential changes to the scheme. \r\n",
    "Condition : 3 - All external materials used in the construction of the development hereby approved shall match the type, texture, tone, colour, size and profile of those used on the existing building and shall be retained permanently. \r\nReason: In the interest of the appearance of the development and to safeguard visual amenity, in accordance with Council policy DMS1 of the Development Management Policies Document (adopted March 2016) coupled with the requirements of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021.\r\n",
    "Condition : 4 - INFORMATIVE: In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework 2021 to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application.  The Council has made available detailed advice in the form of its statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning Documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre-application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably. In addition, where appropriate, further guidance was offered to the applicant during the processing of the application.  ",
    "Reason : 1 - \"\tThe proposed front dormer by reason of its siting, scale and massing would be harmful to the character and appearance of this property and to the visual amenities of the surrounding area. It would result in a highly visible, over-dominant roof feature that could not be considered as subservient to the host property. The proposal would therefore be contrary to policies DMS1 (General development principles) and DMH5 (Alterations and extensions) of the Development Management Policies Document (2016) and the Housing (2016).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed first floor roof terrace, by reason of its siting, scale and design would result in an incongruous, prominent and visually intrusive addition to the rear elevation of the property that would be harmful to the character and appearance of the property, to the predominant local pattern of development and the streetscene. The use of the roof terrace would also constitute an unneighbourly form of development that would harm the amenity of neighbouring properties in the form of noise disturbance and loss of privacy through actual and perceived overlooking. Accordingly, the proposal would therefore be contrary to policies DMS1 and DMH5 of the Development Management Policies Document (2016), and the Housing SPD (2016).",
    "Reason : 3 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
