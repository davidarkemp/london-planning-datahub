It does therefore not comply with Core Strategy (2016) policy IS4 and DMPD policy DMS5, and the provisions of the NPPF.",
    "Reason : 2 - 2.\tUnder Schedule 2, Part 20, Class AA.2 (1) (e) of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended), prior approval is refused. The proposed two storey addition to the existing building, by reason of its combined siting, height, scale, bulk and overall design results in an incongruous, disproportionate, dominant and unsympathetic form of development that would have an adverse impact on the form and appearance of the host property, be out of character with the surrounding area and have a harmful visual impact on the street scene. As such, the development is contrary to DMPD policy DMS1, Core Strategy policy IS3 and the NPPF (2019)."
