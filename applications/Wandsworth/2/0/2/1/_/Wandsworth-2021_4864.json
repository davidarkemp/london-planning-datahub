  "decision_conditions": [
    "Condition : 1 - The development hereby permitted shall be begun within 3 years from the date of this permission.\nReason: To prevent the accumulation of unimplemented planning permissions and to comply with Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended) and to meet the requirements of Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004 and to meet the requirements of The Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015.",
    "Condition : 2 - The development shall be carried out in accordance with the reports, specifications and drawings detailed 20061PL3140, 20061PL3170A, 20061PL3171A, 20061PL3111A, 20061PL3110A, 20061PL3109A, 20061PL3114A, 20061PL3175, 'Construction Drawings', and 'DuoPlain Product Data Sheet'. \nReason: To ensure a satisfactory standard of development and to allow the local planning authority to review any potential changes to the scheme.",
    "Condition : 3 - Prior to the first occupation of the development the cycle parking shown on the approved drawing 20061PL3110A shall be provided, and be retained for cycle parking purposes for the users of the development and for no other purpose.\nReason: To ensure adequate provision is made for cycle parking in accordance with Council policy DMT2 of the Development Management Policies Document (adopted March 2016) coupled with the requirements of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021.",
    "Condition : 4 - Prior to occupation of any part of the development the disabled parking area shown on the approved drawing 20061PL3110A shall be provided and shall be retained for disabled parking purposes for the users of the development and for no other purpose. \nReason: To ensure adequate arrangements are made for off-street parking in accordance with Council policy DMT2 of the Development Management Policies Document (adopted March 2016) coupled with the requirements of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021.",
    "Condition : 5 - Prior to the first occupation of the development, the refuse and recycling storage shown on approved drawing 20061PL3109A shall be provided and shall be retained for the users of the development and for no other purpose.\nReason: To ensure adequate provision is made for waste storage in accordance with Council policy DMS1 of the Development Management Policies Document (adopted March 2016) coupled with the requirements of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021.",
    "Condition : 6 - INFORMATIVE: In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework 2021 to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application.  The Council has made available detailed advice in the form of its statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning Documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre-application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably. In addition, where appropriate, further guidance was offered to the applicant during the processing of the application.",
    "Condition : 7 - INFORMATIVE: The Council's refuse and recycling collectors must be able to gain access freely to the approved storage area or by using an FB 2 or 4 standard pattern key, and there must be a smooth and level bin push route. Kitchen waste storage should be twin stream and the Council encourages food waste macerators in kitchen sinks where composting is likely to be impractical.",
    "Condition : 8 - INFORMATIVE: Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL): From the information available, it appears that the development permitted is subject to a Community Infrastructure Levy charge in accordance with the Community Infrastructure Levy Regulations 2010 (as amended) (the \"Regulations\"). \nYou or the relevant interested parties are required to provide the Council with the information set out in the Regulations. This process for the collection of CIL includes:  the requirement to complete an \"Assumption of Liability\" form as soon as possible;  in order to claim charitable exemption or social housing relief or other forms of relief you or the relevant interested party should also complete a \"Claiming Exemption or Relief\" form. \nThe Council will, if appropriate, then issue a Liability Notice(s) which details the charges due. As soon as the developer, landowner or other interested party(ies) is aware of the date when development is going to start they must also submit a \"Commencement Notice\".  Failure to comply with the Regulations, including failure to complete the forms when required or providing inaccurate information can lead to surcharges or other penalties as set out in the Regulations. It can also mean that any exemptions or reliefs are lost.\nGeneral information on the Community Infrastructure Levy, including the forms mentioned above can be found on the Planning Portal (www.planningportal.gov.uk). Details of the Mayoral CIL can be found on the GLA and TfL websites (www.london.gov.uk and www.tfl.gov.uk). The Assumption of Liability Form, Claiming of Exemption or Relief Form and Commencement Notice must be sent to: Community Infrastructure Levy Environment and Community Services Wandsworth Council Town Hall London SW18 2PU cil@wandsworth.gov.uk Fax: 020 8871 6003 (marked FAO CIL)",
    "Condition : 9 - INFORMATIVE: Any assessment of CIL liability by the Council has been based on the information provided. The assessment of CIL liability referred to in this informative is indicative only and is not intended to provide a binding estimate of the actual CIL liability likely to be incurred.  The assessment of the actual CIL liability will be provided pursuant to and in accordance with the Community Infrastructure Levy Regulations 2010 (as amended).  Where the calculation of CIL liability includes taking account of the existing use of a building, CIL liability may change if the information provided in relation to the existing use(s) of buildings, is not still current at the time of the decision which first permits development."
