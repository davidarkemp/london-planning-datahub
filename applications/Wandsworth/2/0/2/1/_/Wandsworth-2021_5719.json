    "Reason : 1 - By reason of its design, scale and appearance the replacement front boundary results in  an inappropriate and incongruous addition that is out of keeping with the original boundary treatments and harms the rhythm, unity, character and appearance of the streetscene and the Totterdown Fields Conservation Area. The development therefore is considered to cause less than substantial harm to the character and appearance of the conservation area, with no public benefit to outweigh the harm, contrary to Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 and paragraphs 199, 200, and 202 of the NPPF (2021), as well as policies DMS1 and DMS2 of the Development Management Policies Document (2016), the Housing SPD (2016) and the Totterdown Fields Conservation Area Appraisal and Management Strategy. ",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
