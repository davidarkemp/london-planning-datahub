    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development by reason its scale and depth of protrusion in front of the established building line on the northern side of Terrapin Road would represent an unsympathetic and visually intrusive addition within the street scene. It would unacceptably detract from the local spatial character and would fail to preserve the character and appearance of the Heaver Estate Conservation Area. The proposal would therefore be contrary to s.72(1) of the Planning (LBCA) Act 1990 and policies DMS1 (General development principles) and DMS2 (Managing the historic environment) of Wandsworth's Development Management Policies Document (2016) and Policy HC1 of the London Plan (2021). \t",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
