  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The development would by reason of its design cause harm to the Conservation Area. The shutters do not create an acceptable degree of visual integration with the host property or the street scene. \r\nThe proposal therefore fails to comply with the objectives of DMPD (2016) policies DMS1, DMTS5, DMTS9, DMT1, and the Shopfronts SPG (1988).",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably. In addition further guidance was offered to the applicant by the case officer during the processing of the application to identify amendments to address those elements of the scheme considered unacceptable. However, the necessary amendments to make the application acceptable are substantial and would materially change the development proposal. They would require further consultations to be undertaken prior to determination, which could not take place within the statutory determination period specified by the Department of Communities and Local Government. You are therefore encouraged to consider submission of a fresh application incorporating the material amendments set out below which are necessary to make the scheme acceptable. \r\n\r\nRequired amendments:\r\n\r\nLaminated glass, and/or a lattice brick-bond grille which should be installed internally behind the windows, with the box inserted into the ceiling so it is not visible through the window\r\n\r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - Enforcement action:\r\nFor the reasons set out above it is considered expedient and in the public interest to initiate formal enforcement action to secure removal of the unauthorised shutters. This action may consist of issue of an enforcement notice and in the event of non-compliance, prosecution proceedings and the taking of direct action pursuant to sections 172, 178 and 179 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended)."
