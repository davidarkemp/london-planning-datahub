  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The development by reason of it is appearance, scale and siting represents a visually obtrusive and incongruous addition that relates poorly to the host building and is out of place with the prevailing character of shopfronts on this parade. Therefore, it fails to integrate with its surroundings and detracts from the local spatial character. The development is contrary to policy IS3 of the Core Strategy (2016), policies DMS1, DMTS9 and DMTS10 of the Development Management Policies Document (2016) and the Shopfronts SPG (1988).",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
