    "Condition : 1 - The development shall be carried out in accordance with the reports, specifications and drawings detailed [\"BT Streethub: WDW-201 Rev B\", Drawing Showing Elevations and Plan of the Proposed Street Hub, and Planning Support Statement (ref. WDW-201)]. \r\nReason: To ensure a satisfactory standard of development and to allow the local planning authority to review any potential changes to the scheme. \r\n\r\n",
    "Condition : 2 - The maximum steady brightness of any signs hereby permitted is not to exceed 600 candelas per sq. m during daylight hours and 280 candelas per sq. m between dusk and dawn. The levels of luminance on the digital signs should be controlled by light sensors to measure the ambient brightness and dimmers to control the lighting output to within these limits.\r\nReason: To ensure the sign does not have an adverse effect on the amenity of the area in accordance with Council policy DMS8 and to comply with paragraph 132 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021.\r\n",
    "Condition : 3 - The advertisements must be static and contain no moving features, flashing, animation, intermittent light source or exposed cold cathode tubing. Sequential advertisements displayed via the unit permitted by this consent shall not change more than once every 10 seconds. The interval between successive displays shall take place over a period no greater than one second; the complete screen shall change with no visual effects (including fading, swiping or other animated transition methods) between displays and the display will include a mechanism to freeze the image in the event of a malfunction. \r\nReason: In the interest of highway safety and of the visual amenities of the locality in accordance with Council policy DMS8 and to comply with paragraph 132 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021.\r\n",
    "Condition : 4 - No advertisement displayed shall resemble traffic signs, as defined in section 64 of the Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984. \r\nReason: In the interest of highway safety in accordance with Council Policy DMS8.\r\n",
    "Condition : 5 - No music or sound shall be emitted from the advertisements. \r\nReason: In the interest of the aural amenities of the locality in accordance with Council Policy DMS1 and DMS8.\r\n",
    "Condition : 6 - INFORMATIVE: In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework 2021 to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application.  The Council has made available detailed advice in the form of its statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning Documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre-application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably. In addition, where appropriate, further guidance was offered to the applicant during the processing of the application.  ",
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed Street Hub structure, by reason of its scale, design, location, size and the nature, number and scale of advertisement panels would harm visual amenity including the setting of the surrounding conservation area. Whilst the proposal would result in some facilities for the general public, these benefits are low and do not outweigh the harm identified. The proposal fails to comply with the NPPF, policies HC1, D3 and D8 of the London Plan (2021), and policies DMS1, DMS2, DMS8 and DMS9 of the DMPD (2016). It would also fail to comply with policies LP1, LP3, LP9 and LP22 of the PVLP (2022).\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
