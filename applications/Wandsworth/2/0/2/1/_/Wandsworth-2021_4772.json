    "Reason : 1 - The proposal constitutes development under the Town and Country Planning Act 1990, and the local planning authority is not satisfied that, based on the drawings submitted as part of the application, this proposal falls within any class of 'permitted development' specified within Schedule 2 to the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).\r\nINFORMATIVE: The proposed development fails to comply with paragraph A.1(9)(c) of Class A of Part 16, Schedule 2 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended) as the volume of the proposed cabinets exceeds 2.5 cubic metres.\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The development would by reason of its siting and appearance dominate the surrounding public open space, obstruct pedestrian access to it and cause unacceptable safety concerns. It would dominate and cause harm to the streetscape, conservation area, and the adjacent locally listed building, because of the siting, height and width of the pole, and siting, height, width and number of the cabinets. Its scale and appearance would provide an unacceptable outlook to surrounding residential development.\r\nThe proposal therefore fails to comply with the National Planning Policy Framework, policies D3, D8, HC1 and T2 of the London Plan (2021), and policies DMS1, DMS2, DMS9 and DMO1 of the Development Management Policies Document (2016).\r\n"
