    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development, by reason of its design, siting and general layout, would result in a poor standard of additional accommodation that would fail to physically integrate well with the host building, and would not contribute positively to the local spatial character of the wider site and surrounding area contrary to the aims of DMPD policy DMS1.  ",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed development, by reason of the introduction of balconies in close proximity to existing residential dwellings in Kersfield House, would result in undue overlooking and noise to the detriment of the existing amenities of those nearby residents, contrary to DMPD policy DMS1.",
    "Reason : 3 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
