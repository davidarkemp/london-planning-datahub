  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development for co-living units does not meet an identified local need as evidenced by the Council's up-to-date Local Housing Needs Assessment (2020) (LHNA).  Granting consent for the proposed development would prevent an extant planning permission, under reference 2018/3776, for self-contained residential units from being constructed on-site for which there is an identified need. This extant permission includes 60 affordable homes (39 affordable rented units and 21 intermediate units) for which Wandsworth has a documented need as evidenced within the LHNA, particularly affordable rented units.  The proposed development fails to deliver on-site affordable accommodation which runs contrary to this objective.  In this respect, the proposed development does not comply with Policy IS5 (Achieving a mix of housing including affordable housing) of the Council's Core Strategy (adopted March 2016) and Policy DMH9 (Hostels, staff and shared accommodation (including student housing), specialist and supported housing) of the Council's Development Management Policy Document (adopted March 2016) and Policy H1 of the London Plan 2021 (Increasing housing supply).  The proposed development also fails to comply with Policies PM9B (Wandsworth's Riverside) and LP29C (Housing with Shared Facilities) of the Council's emerging Local Plan (Regulation 19) Version January 2022, submitted for examination on 29 April 2022 along with Section 5 of the 2021 NPPF with particular regard to paragraphs 61, 62, 63, 66 and 68. ",
    "Reason : 2 - In the absence of a completed Section 106 planning obligation the proposal fails to meet the objectives of Policy IS7 (Planning obligations) of the Council's Core Strategy (2016) and the Wandsworth Planning Obligations Supplementary Planning Document (2020) and Policy LP62 (Planning Obligations) of the Council's Local Plan Publication (Regulation 19) Version January 2022 submitted for examination on 29 April 2022.  A Section 106 planning obligation would be required to include but not be limited to:\r\naffordable housing payment in lieu (�16,560,000) with payment triggers including early and late stage review mechanisms\r\na Shared Living Operational Management Plan \r\nprevention of sale or use as self-contained Class C3 accommodation and tenancy controls\r\na Work Space Management Plan\r\na construction management plan \r\nparking and highways improvements/contributions including exclusion from future controlled parking zone \r\nFlood Evacuation and Refuge Plan\r\nlocal employment and skills contribution, local employment skills plan\r\ncarbon offset payment\r\nfuture connection to District Heat Network\r\nenergy monitoring\r\ncontributions toward GP practices in the Wandsworth Primary Care Network \r\nassociated monitoring fee \r\n"
