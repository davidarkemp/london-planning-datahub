  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The scale and design of the second floor rear extension (and associated roof terrace) would appear as bulky and unsympathetic addition to the host building and causes harm to the character and appearance of the streetscene. In addition, the applicant has failed to demonstrate how the development would not cause any increase in flood risk following the internal changes at ground level, nor has sufficient bin/refuse storage space been provided in accordance with the provisions as set out within the Waste and Recyclables SPD. As such, the proposal would not be in accordance with the NPPF (2021), policy DMS1 and DMS5 or DMH5 of the Wandsworth DMPD (2016), draft policies contained within the LP1 and LP2 of the 2022 Publication Version Local Plan, and the guidance contained within the Housing SPD (2016) and Refuse and Recyclables SPD (2014). ",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
