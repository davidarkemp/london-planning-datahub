  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - 1.\tGiven its size, scale, prominent location and illumination, it is considered that the proposed freestanding illuminated advertisement would be an obtrusive, conspicuous and unsympathetic structure that would detract from the visual amenity of the surroundings and would obscure adjacent trees. It is considered that the illuminated advertisement would have a harmful impact upon the visual amenity and green and open character of the area which includes an area of public open space. As a result, the proposed illuminated freestanding advert would fail to comply with the NPPF (2021), the NPPG (2019) and policy and DMS8 of Wandsworth's Development Management Policies Document (2016)."
