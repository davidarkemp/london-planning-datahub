    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development, by reason of its scale, siting, form and appearance, would be an inappropriate and visually intrusive addition, failing to maintain subservience to the existing property and failing to achieve a high degree of physical integration with its surroundings, contrary to policies DMS1 and DHM5 of the Development Management Policies Document (adopted March 2016), policy D3 of the London Plan (2021) and paragraph 130 of the NPPF (2021).",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
