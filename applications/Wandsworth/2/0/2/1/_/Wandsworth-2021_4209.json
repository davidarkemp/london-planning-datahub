  "description": "Variation of condition 2 (in accordance with approved drawings) and removal of condition 4 (requires conservtion area roof lights that are flush with roof plane) pursuant to planning permission dated 24/02/2020 ref 2019/4775 (Erection of roof extension to main rear and side roof slopes and set-back to gable (with French doors and safety railings) and roof extension with projecting dormers over two-storey back addition) to allow the approval of plan numbers of drawings submitted.",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - This application, made under s.73A of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended), is not capable of being assessed at it seeks to obtain retrospective planning permission for non-compliance with conditions where the degree of development undertaken at the application site has fundamentally altered from that originally permitted and no planning permission therefore exists at the same site. ",
    "Reason : 2 - Notwithstanding reason for refusal one (1), the proposed works, including the increase in pitch of the front roof-plane and increase in height of the ridge are poorly designed alterations that and fail to integrate successfully with the design and proportions of the host building. The alterations also result in a discordant relationship between the host building and the adjoining property (no. 41) which have been designed cohesively as a pair. This is harmful to the appearance of both buildings and harmful to the streetscape of Wakehurst Road, failing to comply with policies DMS1 (General Development Principles) and DMH5 (Residential Alterations and Extensions) of our adopted DMPD (2016). ",
    "Reason : 3 - The property is located in the Wandsworth Common Conservation Area, a designated heritage asset which the LPA has a duty to consider preserving or enhancing when making decisions on applications which affect it. This part of Wakehurst Road is characterised by two to three storey terrace and semi-detached late Victorian dwellinghouses which are largely of a homogenous design with individual features replicated between sets of pairs. This creates a noticeable harmony between the buildings which contributes positively to the character of the CA. The unauthorised development has a negative visual impact on this character and results in (less than substantial) harm to the character of the CA. There is no identifiable public benefit or justification that outweighs this harm. The proposals fail to comply with policy DMS2 (Managing the Historic Environment) of our adopted DMPD (2016) and chapter 16 of the NPPF (2021). "
