  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - By reason of its design, siting, size and scale the proposed development would be an incongruous, unsympathetic and visually intrusive addition to the streetscene and locality. It would fail to physically integrate with its surroundings and would detract from the local spatial character. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policy DMS1 (General development principles) of the Council's Development Management Policies Document (2016), Policy IS3 (Good quality design and townscape) of the Council's Core Strategy (2016) and the provisions of the NPPF (2021).\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - By reason of its location, height and depth the proposal would constitute an unneighbourly form of development that would result in an unacceptable loss of outlook, appear visually overbearing and create an increased sense of enclosure to the detriment of the neighbouring occupants' residential and visual amenities. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policy DMS1c of the Council's Development Management Policies Document (2016).\r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - By reason of its location and design, the proposed roof terrace would result in an unacceptable loss of privacy to no. 1 Marney Road and nos. 8-12 Stormont Road to the detriment of the occupants' residential amenities. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policy DMS1c of the Council's Development Management Policies Document (2016).\r\n",
    "Reason : 4 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
