  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed telecommunications equipment would by reason of their siting and appearance be visually discordant, unsympathetic and of intrusive scale and design that would result in excessive clutter in the streetscene, harming visual amenity and spatial character of the location and the character, appearance and heritage significance of the conservation area. The equipment would also result in an imposing and overbearing impact on the amenity of nearby residents and would impact the quality of the local play area. The proposal would not meet with the conditions attached to the relevant Class A of Part 16 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order and would be contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policies SI6, T1 and T4 of the London Plan (2021), policy IS3 of the Wandsworth Core Strategy (2016), policies DMS1, DMS2, DMS9 and DMT1 of the Wandsworth Development Management Policies Document (2016) and the guidance within the TfL's Streetscape Guidance Publication (2019 rev 1) ",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
