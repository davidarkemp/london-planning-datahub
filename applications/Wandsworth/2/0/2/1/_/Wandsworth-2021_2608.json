    "Reason : 1 - The proposal would result in the conversion of a property consisting of less than 150m2 of existing habitable floorspace, which is not unsuitable for family accommodation. By reason of the size and proposed level of occupancy, the 2 bedroom flat on the first and second floors would present an undersized residential unit. In addition, the proposal would result in a substandard level of accommodation and amenity for the future occupiers of the 2 bedroom flat on the ground floor with poor levels of daylight/sunlight and outlook for the rear double bedroom. The proposal has also failed to demonstrate that adequate floor to ceiling head height would be achieved for both flats. As such, the proposal has not overcome the previous reason for refusal and would be contrary to policies DMS1, DMH2, DMH4 and DMH6 of the Development Management Policies Document (2016), and the Technical Housing Standards - Nationally Described Space Standard (2015).",
    "Reason : 2 - INFORMATIVE: Please be advised that the proposed drawings are inaccurate as they do not include the rear dormer extension on the proposed side elevation. ",
