    "Condition : 1 - The development hereby permitted shall be begun within 3 years from the date of this permission.\nReason: To prevent the accumulation of unimplemented planning permissions and to comply with Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended) and to meet the requirements of Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004 and to meet the requirements of The Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015.\n",
    "Condition : 2 - The development shall be carried out in accordance with the reports, specifications and drawings detailed 2020-014-LP; 2020-014-004 Rev C; 2020-014-005 Rev B; 2020-014-006 Rev B; 2020-014-007. \nReason: To ensure a satisfactory standard of development and to allow the local planning authority to review any potential changes to the scheme. \n",
    "Condition : 3 - All external materials used in the construction of the development hereby approved shall match the type, texture, tone, colour, size and profile of those used on the existing building and shall be retained permanently. \nReason: In the interest of the appearance of the development and to safeguard visual amenity, in accordance with Council policy DMS1 of the Development Management Policies Document (adopted March 2016) coupled with the requirements of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021.\n",
    "Condition : 4 - Prior to commencement of use of the terrace as shown on drawing numbers  2020-014-004 Rev B, 2020-014-005 Rev B and 2020-014-006 Rev B the obscure glazed screening to each side and rear at a minimum height of 1.7m above finished floor level shall be installed.  The screening shall be retained and maintained as such thereafter.\nReason: To protect the privacy of neighbours by preventing overlooking and in the interest of visual amenity in accordance with Council policy DMS1 of the Development Management Policies Document (adopted March 2016) coupled with the requirements of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021.\n",
    "Condition : 5 - INFORMATIVE: This application is in an area known to host house sparrow \n(Passer domesticus), a species undergoing national declines in population. \nThis species often use buildings for nesting, and works to add extensions can disturb such nesting activity and can therefore be detrimental to biodiversity unless appropriately timed. We recommend you time your preparatory, demolition and construction works to occur outside the nesting season (ie between Sept and Feb) as a precautionary approach to prevent breaches of wildlife law. Additionally, we would welcome the inclusion of bird nesting boxes particularly those designed for swifts as these can also be used by sparrows -these can be integrated within the new construction or retrofitted onto the outside. For further advice please contact the biodiversity team at Enable Leisure and Culture who provide biodiversity advice on behalf of the Council by email to biodiversity@enablelc.org.\n",
    "Condition : 6 - INFORMATIVE: In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework 2021 to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application.  The Council has made available detailed advice in the form of its statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning Documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre-application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably. In addition, where appropriate, further guidance was offered to the applicant during the processing of the application.  "
