  "decision_conditions": [
    "Condition : 1 - INFORMATIVE: In making its decision, the Local Planning Authority brings attention to a number of inconsistencies within the submission documents, notably the number of existing residential units within the six-storey building known as 'Creative House'. The submitted application form states that there are 22, with the proposal applying to 21 of those units. However, the submitted floor plans only show 18 residential units, with the suggestion that 1no. of these is excluded from the application (Flat 12 on the 4th floor). ",
    "Condition : 2 - INFORMATIVE: In making its decision, the Local Planning Authority has taken the view that the ground and mezzanine areas identified as office use on the submitted plans continue to be used in this manner and as such there is no increased risk of flooding owing to the site's location in Flood Zone 3A. If these areas are in short-term let use, the Applicant should be aware that there would have been a requirement for an Exceptions Test Assessment to be carried out that would be expected to set out in an Flood Risk Assessment which would address the increased risk arising from changing to a more vulnerable use compared with the approved use.",
    "Reason : 1 - 1.\tThe proposed change of use of 21 of the 22 residential units (Class C3) to short-let accommodation (Class C1) for a temporary period of six months would result in the unacceptable loss of residential accommodation contrary to London Plan Policy H8 and DMPD Policy DMH1. ",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
