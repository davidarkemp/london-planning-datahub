  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposal would result in the loss of a dwelling with less than 150sq.m. existing habitable floorspace (excluding post-2008 additions) and considered suitable for families. The proposal would therefore result in harm to the existing choice of housing stock within the borough and would fail to comply with policy DMH2 of the Development Management Policies Document (adopted 2016). ",
    "Reason : 2 - By reason of the their scale and design, the proposed flats would fail to meet the minimum internal floor area requirement for 2b/4p and 3b/6p flats and the rear bedroom within the lower flat would have poor access to outlook and daylight. The development would therefore result in substandard accommodation for future occupiers and would therefore fail to accord with the Technical housing standards - Nationally described space standard and policies DMH4 and DMH6 of the Development Management Policies Document 2016. ",
    "Reason : 3 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
