    "Condition : 1 - The development shall be carried out in accordance with the reports, specifications and drawings detailed [001; 300; 301; 302; 310; 320; Design and Access Statement (dated 06/10/2021); Proposed Refuse and Recycling Storage Facilities (received 11/01/2022); Waste Storage Cover Note (received 11/01/2022); Fire Safety Strategy (dated 07/10/2021)]. \nReason: To ensure a satisfactory standard of development and to allow the local planning authority to review any potential changes to the scheme. \n",
    "Condition : 2 - The development hereby permitted shall be begun within 3 years from the date of this permission.\nReason: To prevent the accumulation of unimplemented planning permissions and to comply with Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended) and to meet the requirements of Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004 and to meet the requirements of The Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015.\n",
    "Condition : 3 - All external materials used in the construction of the development hereby approved shall match the type, texture, tone, colour, size and profile of those used on the existing building and shall be retained permanently. \nReason: In the interest of the appearance of the development and to safeguard visual amenity, in accordance with Council policy DMS1 of the Development Management Policies Document (adopted March 2016) coupled with the requirements of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021.\n",
    "Condition : 4 - Prior to commencement of use of the terrace as shown on drawing number [310; 320] the obscure glazed screening to each side and rear at a minimum height of 1.7m above finished floor level shall be installed.  The screening shall be retained and maintained as such thereafter.\nReason: To protect the privacy of neighbours by preventing overlooking and in the interest of visual amenity in accordance with Council policy DMS1 of the Development Management Policies Document (adopted March 2016) coupled with the requirements of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021.\n",
    "Condition : 5 - The development shall achieve a maximum water use of 105 litres per person per day (plus 5 litres for outside use) in line with the Water Efficiency Calculator for new dwellings from the Department of Communities and Local Government. Prior to first occupation, evidence to demonstrate that that the internal water consumption of the development will not exceed 105l/p/day must be submitted to the local planning authority and approved in writing, unless otherwise agreed in writing by the local planning authority. Measures integrated shall be retained for the lifetime of the development.\nReason: In the interest of sustainable development and to accord with Council policy DMS3 of the Development Management Policies Document (adopted March 2016) coupled with the requirements of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021.",
    "Condition : 6 - Prior to commencement of above ground works (excluding demolition), details of the location, number and design of secure and covered cycle parking shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority.  The cycle parking shall be provided in accordance with the approved details prior to the occupation of the development and be retained for cycle parking purposes for the users of the development and for no other purpose.\nReason: To ensure adequate provision is made for cycle parking in accordance with Council policy DMT2 of the Development Management Policies Document (adopted March 2016) coupled with the requirements of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021.\n",
    "Condition : 7 - Prior to the commencement of above ground works (excluding demolition), details of the siting, design and materials of refuse and recycling storage to serve the development shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority. The refuse storage facilities shall be provided in accordance with the approved details prior to occupation of the development, and shall be retained thereafter.\nReason: In the interests of amenity and hygiene, in accordance with Council policy DMS1 of the Development Management Policies Document (adopted March 2016) coupled with the requirements of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021.\n",
    "Condition : 8 - INFORMATIVE: In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework 2021 to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application.  The Council has made available detailed advice in the form of its statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning Documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre-application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably. In addition, where appropriate, further guidance was offered to the applicant during the processing of the application.  ",
    "Reason : 1 - The development would by reason of the conversion of a property consisting of less than 150square metres of existing habitable floorspace which is not unsuitable for family accommodation, cause harm to the quality and mix of local housing stock. The development would therefore result in harm to the existing choice of housing stock within the borough, and would fail to comply with policy DMH2 and DMH4 of the Wandsworth Development Management Policies Document (adopted 2016).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
    "Reason : 2 - Insufficient details for the siting, design and materials of refuse and recyling storage have been provided to demonstrate that the development would comply with the Refuse and Recyclables in Developments SPD (2014), Council policy DMS1 of the Development Management Policies Document (adopted March 2016) coupled with the requirements of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021.",
    "Reason : 3 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
