    "Reason : 1 - By reason of its poor design, siting, size and scale the proposed development would be an incongruous, unsympathetic and visually intrusive addition to the original building, streetscene and locality. It would fail to physically integrate with its surroundings, would detract from the local spatial character, and would fail to preserve the character and appearance of the Park Town Conservation Area. The proposal would therefore be contrary to s.72(1) of the Planning (LBCA) Act 1990 and Policies DMS1 (General development principles), DMS2 (Managing the historic environment) and DMH5 (Alterations and extensions) of the Council's Development Management Policies Document (2016) and the Supplementary Planning Document: Housing (2016).\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
