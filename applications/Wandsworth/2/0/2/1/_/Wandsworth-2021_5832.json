  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed Street Hub structure, by reason of its scale, design, location, size and the nature, number and scale of advertisement panels, would harm visual amenity, would pose a potential distraction to road users to the harm of public safety. It would fail to comply with the Mayor's Vision Zero which aims to eradicate deaths and serious injuries from London's transport network. Whilst the proposal would result in some facilities for the general public, these benefits are low and do not outweigh the harm identified. The proposal fails to comply with the NPPF, policies D3, D8, T2 and T4 of the London Plan (2021), and policies DMS1, DMS8, DMS9 and DMT1 of the DMPD (2016). It would also fail to comply with policies LP1, LP9, LP22, LP49 and LP50 of the PVLP (2022).\r\n\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
