    "Reason : 1 - By reason of its poor standard of design, siting, size and scale the development is an incongruous, unsympathetic and visually intrusive addition to the streetscene and locality. It fails to physically integrate with its surroundings and detracts from the local spatial character. The development is contrary to Policies DMS1 (General development principles) and DMH5 (Alterations and extensions) of the Council's Development Management Policies Document (2016) and the Supplementary Planning Document: Housing (2016).   \r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal.",
    "Reason : 3 - ENFORCEMENT ACTION:\r\nFor the reasons set out above it is considered expedient and in the public interest to initiate formal enforcement action to secure removal of the unauthorised wall and gate to the front and side elevation. This action may consist of issue of an enforcement notice, prosecution proceedings and the taking of direct action pursuant to sections 172, 178 and 179 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended). \r\n"
