  "decision_conditions": [
    "Condition : 1 - The development hereby permitted shall be begun within 3 years from the date of this permission.\nReason: To prevent the accumulation of unimplemented planning permissions and to comply with Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended) and to meet the requirements of Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004 and to meet the requirements of The Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015.\n",
    "Condition : 2 - The development shall be carried out in accordance with the reports, specifications and drawings detailed [\"BT Streethub: WDW-201 Rev B\", Drawing Showing Elevations and Plan of the Proposed Street Hub, and Planning Support Statement (ref. WDW-201)]. \nReason: To ensure a satisfactory standard of development and to allow the local planning authority to review any potential changes to the scheme. \n",
    "Condition : 3 - No development shall take place until the existing phone boxes shown on plan ref: \"BT Streethub: WDW-201 Rev B\", outside no. 80 to 86 St Johns Road (SW11 1PX) are removed in their entirety and the land made good to the same condition as the adjacent land. \nReason: To prevent the retention of redundant telecoms equipment in order to achieve an acceptable effect on the appearance, amenity and public safety of the location in accordance with Council Policies DMS1 and DMS2 of the Development Management Policies Document (adopted March 2016).\n",
    "Condition : 4 - In the event that the BT Street Hub scheme ceases or alters in a manner so as to leave this structure without function, then the structure shall be removed in its entirety and the land made good to the same condition as the adjacent land within 3 months of the cessation of the use of the structure. \nReason: To prevent the retention of redundant telecoms equipment in order to ensure no long term harm to the appearance, amenity and public safety of the location in accordance with Council Policy DMS1 of the Development Management Policies Document (adopted March 2016).\n",
    "Condition : 5 - INFORMATIVE: In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework 2021 to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application.  The Council has made available detailed advice in the form of its statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning Documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre-application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably. In addition, where appropriate, further guidance was offered to the applicant during the processing of the application.  ",
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed Street Hub structure, by reason of its scale, design, location, size and the nature, number and scale of advertisement panels would harm visual amenity including the setting of the surrounding conservation area. Whilst the proposal would result in some facilities for the general public, these benefits are low and do not outweigh the harm identified. The proposal fails to comply with the NPPF, policies HC1, D3 and D8 of the London Plan (2021), and policies DMS1, DMS2, DMS8 and DMS9 of the DMPD (2016). It would also fail to comply with policies LP1, LP3, LP9 and LP22 of the PVLP (2022).\n",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
