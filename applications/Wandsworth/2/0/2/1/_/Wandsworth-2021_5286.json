    "Reason : 1 - The development would by reason of its siting, design and highly visible alterations to the original building and terrace's form cause harm to the character, appearance and significance of the building, the terrace and the heritage significance of the wider Dover House Estate conservation area. This harm would not be outweighed by the proposed improvements to the front of the building.\r\nThe proposal therefore fails to comply with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policies D3 and HC1 of the London Plan (2021), and policies DMS1, DMS2 and DMH5 of the Development Management Policies Document (2016).",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
