    "Reason : 1 - By reason of their design, siting, size and scale the proposed roof extensions would be a prominent, unsympathetic and visually intrusive addition to the original building, streetscene and locality. They would fail to physically integrate with its surroundings and would detract from the local spatial character. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policies IS3 and PL1 of the Core Strategy (2016) and policies DMS1 and DMH5 of the Development Management Policies Document (2016) and the Supplementary Planning Document: Housing (2016).",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
