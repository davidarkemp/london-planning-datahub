    "Reason : 1 - The proposal, by reason of its style, scale and location, would be an incongruous and unsightly form of development which would have an undue impact on the visual amenity, character and appearance of the host dwelling, the terrace of which it forms part and surrounding area. As such the proposal would fail to comply with sections 2 and 12 of the NPPF (2021), policy D6 of the London Plan (2021), locally adopted policies IS3 of the Core Strategy (2016) and local policies DMS1 and DMH5 of the DMPD (2016), and 'Housing' SPD (2016). ",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
