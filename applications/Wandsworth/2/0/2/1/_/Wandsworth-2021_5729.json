  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The development by reason of its bulk, materials, siting and overall design would be an obtrusive feature and cause undue harm to the visual amenity of the street scene and local character. It would be unduly harmful to the amenity of nearby occupiers in the form of overlooking, being overbearing and creating an increased sense of enclosure compared to the existing situation. The proposed accommodation would be substandard and would fail to provide adequate cycle and refuse storage.\r\nThe proposal therefore fails to comply with the National Planning Policy Framework, policies D3, D6 and T5 of the London Plan (2021), policies DMS1, DMS3, DMH4, DMH6, DMH7 and DMT2 of the Development Management Policies Document (2016), the Housing supplementary planning document (2016), and the Refuse and Recyclables in Developments supplementary planning document (2014).\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
