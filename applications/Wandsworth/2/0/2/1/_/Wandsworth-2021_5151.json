    "Condition : 2 - INFORMATIVE: You are reminded that this certificate is issued on the basis of the physical circumstances prevailing at the property when the application was made. If BEFORE the construction of the extension is substantially complete, any other extension is undertaken (such as the extension proposed by planning application 2021/5189 which is currently under consideration), then this certificate would no longer be applicable and planning permission may be required for the development presently proposed.",

    "Condition : 4 - INFORMATIVE: This certificate is based on the drawings and any other information as submitted being a true reflection of the physical circumstances prevailing at the site on the date of the submission of the application.
