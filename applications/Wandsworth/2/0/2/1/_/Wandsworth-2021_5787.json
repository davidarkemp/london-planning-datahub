  "decision_conditions": [
    "Condition : 1 - The development hereby permitted shall be begun within 3 years from the date of this permission.\nReason: To prevent the accumulation of unimplemented planning permissions and to comply with Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended) and to meet the requirements of Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004 and to meet the requirements of The Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015.",
    "Condition : 2 - The development shall be carried out in accordance with the reports, specifications and drawings detailed P_03A, P_04, P_05, P_06, P_07, P_08, P_09, P_10, P_11, PP14 (received on 2 March 2022), PP15, and 'Tree Development Report'. \nReason: To ensure a satisfactory standard of development and to allow the local planning authority to review any potential changes to the scheme.",
    "Condition : 3 - Prior to commencement of above ground works details and samples of materials proposed to be used on all external surfaces of the development shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority. The development shall be carried out in accordance with the approved materials and thereafter so retained. \nReason: In order to assess the suitability of the proposed materials, in the interests of the appearance of the locality, in accordance with Council policy DMS1 of the Development Management Policies Document (adopted March 2016) coupled with the requirements of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021.",
    "Condition : 4 - Prior to commencement of the above ground works details of those parts of the site not covered by buildings, including but not limited to any parking areas, access ways, surface treatment including whether the hard surfacing is porous, and boundary treatment, shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority. The development shall thereafter be carried out in accordance with the approved details and completed prior to occupation of the development or otherwise in accordance with a timetable agreed in writing with the local planning authority.\nReason: To ensure a high quality of development and sustainable drainage in compliance with Council policies DMS1 and DMS6 of the Development Management Policies Document (adopted March 2016) coupled with the requirements of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021.",
    "Condition : 5 - Prior to the commencement of any development preparatory works, including (but not limited to) the erection of scaffolding, soft stripping or works to the roof, confirmation that a European Protected Species (EPS) licence in relation to bats has been secured from Natural England, along with details of the agreed safe working methods and mitigation plan for the loss of multiple roosts shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority. The methods (which may be updated upon confirmation of an accepted licence application) are likely to include:\n1. Confirmation that works will only commence following receipt of an EPS licence from Natural England\n2. Details of alternative roosting before, during and post demolition and construction works\n3. Prior to the start of works a suitably qualified ecologist will deliver a tool-box talk to contractors and staff on site, informing them of the likelihood of encountering bats, what to do if they find bats and give a brief overview of the licence documents.\n4. Pre-works check by a Chartered Institute of Ecology and Environmental Management (CIEEM) qualified ecologist of all known and potential roosting locations on the site. If the entirety of a feature can be searched and found to be empty these will be blocked (with newspaper or expanding foam). If the feature cannot be fully searched it will be excluded using folded acetate or similar to allow bats to leave the feature but not re-enter. If exclusions are used, they will be left in place for a minimum of 5 nights in suitable weather conditions. Following this they will be permanently filled using the same methods as above.\n5. Any required tile removal will be completed under the watching brief of a CIEEM qualified ecologist, with tiles being removed carefully by hand.\n6. If bats are found during works they will be caught by a CIEEM qualified ecologist who will be wearing suitable gloves. The bat will be placed into a cloth bag and carefully placed",
    "Condition : 6 - Prior to the commencement of any development preparatory works, a Construction Environment Management Plan (CEMP) shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority. The demolition and construction works shall be carried out in accordance with the approved plan. The CEMP shall include:\n1. If works are to happen during the nesting season (February to September), details of timing of works and the named ecological clerk of works (a member of CIEEM with experience and knowledge of working in London), who will undertake a site walkover at least 48 hours prior to commencement of any preparatory works to assess for evidence of use of the site (including buildings) by any nesting birds. If a nest is found, an appropriate exclusion zone should be implemented around it until the young have fully fledged in accordance with the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981. ). The law protects all wild bird species, their eggs and nests.\n2. Details of measures to prevent mammal, amphibian or reptile entrapment on site and in excavations.\n3. A construction lighting plan outlining how lighting will be prevented from negatively impacting any protected and priority species during construction. This construction lighting plan must follow best practice industry guidance produced by the Bat Conservation Trust and Institute of Lighting Professionals ('Bats and Artificial Lighting in the UK' (2018) and 'Landscape and Urban Design for Bats and Biodiversity.' (2012)).\n3. Details of measures to be taken to ensure that the immediately adjacent Richmond Park will not be impacted negatively by the works, including (but not limited to) lighting, noise, dust, and air quality and confirmation that Richmond Park will not be used to facilitate any of the building works including (but not limited to) site access and storage of materials, including waste materials and any scaffolding, to prevent any damage to Richmond Park.\n4. An Invasive Non-Native Species (INNS) Plan detailing",
    "Condition : 7 - Prior to commencement of the development, details of bat-related enhancements to the new building shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority, including (but not limited to):\n1. Details of all roofing and roof lining materials. Breathable roofing membranes must not be used in the construction of the new roofs where roosting features could be created due to issues with bat entanglement and reduced membrane performance if used in areas of bat use. 1F bitumastic felt should be used instead.\n2. Specifications (including type and locations) of bat boxes and bricks. These need to be fixed on a south-east to south-west elevation at a height of 4 to 10 metres. Integrated bat boxes within the new build structures or at least attached to the exterior of existing buildings are recommended if possible as they require less maintenance.\nReason: To retain the ecological interest of the site in accordance with Council policy DMO4 of the Development Management Policies Document (adopted March 2016) coupled with the requirements of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021. The details are required prior to the commencement of works to ensure existing biodiversity is protected and the measures are incorporated in the layout and construction of the development.",
