    "Reason : 1 - By reason of its siting, scale and appearance, the proposed air-conditioning unit would be of an incongruous and visually intrusive scale and design, resulting in an awkward addition to the existing roofscape, harming the appearance and spatial character of the host building, the setting of the Grade II Listed Battersea Park and the setting and character of the Battersea Park Conservation Area. The proposal would be contrary to Sections 66(1) and 72(1) of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990, the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policy HC1 of the London Plan (2021), policies PL1 and IS3 of the Wandsworth Core Strategy (2016), policies DMS1, DMS2, and DMH5 of the Wandsworth Development Management Policies Document (2016), as well as guidance within the Housing SPD (2016) and the Battersea Park Conservation Area Appraisal & Management Strategy (2014).",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal.",
