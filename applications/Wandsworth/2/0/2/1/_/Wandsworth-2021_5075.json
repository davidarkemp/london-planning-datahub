    "Reason : 1 - The replacement windows by reason of their design and materials would cause undue harm and cumulative harm to the character and appearance of the building, the terrace, the street scene and the heritage significance of the Dover House Estate conservation area.\r\nThe proposal therefore fails to comply with the NPPF, policies D3 and HC1 of the London Plan, policies PL1 and IS3 of the Core Strategy (2016), and policies DMS1 and DMS2 of the Development Management Policies Document (2016).",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
