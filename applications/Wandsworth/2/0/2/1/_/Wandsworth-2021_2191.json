    "Reason : 1 - The proposed roof extension, by reason of it's design, scale and location would be an inappropriate form of development that combined with previous enlargements would fail to remain subservient to the original property. As a result, the extension would result in harm to the character and appearance of the host property, the pair of semi-detached dwellings it forms part of, the wider street scene and the Wandsworth Common Conservation Area. The proposal therefore fails to comply with policies and DMS1, DMS2 and DMH5 of the Development Management Policies Document (2016), and Housing SPD (2016).\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
