  "decision_conditions": [
    "Condition : 1 - The development hereby permitted shall be begun within 3 years from the date of this permission.\nReason: To prevent the accumulation of unimplemented planning permissions and to comply with Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended) and to meet the requirements of Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004 and to meet the requirements of The Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015.\n",
    "Condition : 2 - The development shall be carried out in accordance with the reports, specifications and drawings detailed [Arboricultural Impact Assessment; Ecological Assessment by LUC dated December 2021; 7067-LD-PLN-115 P1; 7067-LD-SEC-611B Rev P3; 7067-LD-SEC-601B Rev P3 and 7067-LD-PLN-101B Rev P3]. \nReason: To ensure a satisfactory standard of development and to allow the local planning authority to review any potential changes to the scheme. \n",
    "Condition : 3 - Prior to the commencement of works, submit for approval a Construction Environment Management Plan (CEMP) including (but not limited to):\n1. Details of the named ecological clerk of works (a member of CIEEM with experience and knowledge of working in London) who will undertake a site walkover at least 48 hours prior to commencement to assess for evidence of use of the site by protected and priority species (including, but not limited to, hedgehogs, reptiles, stag beetles, Great Crested Newts, bats, nesting birds). \nDetails of measures to prevent mammal, amphibian or reptile entrapment or harm on site and in excavations.\n2. A lighting plan outlining how lighting will be prevented from negatively impacting any protected and priority species during construction, in particular commuting bats, as well as the wider Roehampton Golf Club SINC. \n3. Details of measures to prevent disturbance or contamination (such as dust, water runoff or plant/soil debris) of nearby habitats that are remaining including (but not limited to) trees, scrub, ponds etc.\nREASON: to prevent harm to protected and priority species (DMO4a).\n",
    "Condition : 4 - Prior to commencement of fencing works submit for approval the fencing specifications (including but not limited to):\n- the thickness of the netting\n- the size of the holes in the netting\n- details of how the fencing will be maintained to prevent harm to protected and priority species, in particular birds and bats\n- location and specifications of holes in the bottom of the fencing to allow the movement of hedgehogs and badgers between green spaces.\nREASON: to prevent harm to protected and priority species (DMO4a).\n",
    "Condition : 5 - Prior to commencement of fencing works submit for approval specifications of the proposed bird and bat boxes, including (but not limited to):\n- Location of at least 3 no. bat boxes. These need to be installed on a south-east to south-west elevation at a height of 4 to 10m.\n- Location and number of at least 3 no. bird boxes. These need to be on a north to east elevation to provide protection from direct sunlight, wind and rain at a height of at least 3m. \n- Confirmation that any lighting near the bird and bat boxes will not be directed towards the bird and bat boxes\n- Details of how these bat and bird boxes will be managed going forward\nREASON: to prevent harm to protected and priority species (DMO4a) and to provide biodiversity gain (DMO4b).\n\n",
    "Condition : 6 - Prior to commencement of fencing works submit for approval details of ecological enhancements, including (but not limited to):\n1. Locations and species of shrubs, hedges and trees to be planted. These should be native species and we would recommend consideration being given to including a mixed native species hedge where appropriate (five woody species and one climber, arranged with 3 species at the front and 2 at the back (or visa versa) to ensure a good thickness)). The aim should be to create greater structural diversity than what currently exists.\n2. Locations of log piles to provide suitable habitat for reptiles, hedgehogs and invertebrates and partially buried log piles to provide habitat for stag beetles.\nREASON: to prevent harm to protected and priority species (DMO4a).\n",
    "Condition : 7 - A post-installation bat activity survey to help us understand any impacts of the fencing changes on bats shall be submitted and approved to the Council on completion of the works.\nREASON: to prevent harm to protected and priority species (DMO4a).\n",
    "Condition : 8 - INFORMATIVE: In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework 2021 to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application.  The Council has made available detailed advice in the form of its statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning Documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre-application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably. In addition, where appropriate, further guidance was offered to the applicant during the processing of the application.  "
