    "Condition : 40 - INFORTMATIVE: Sustainable surface water drainage systems are endorsed and encouraged by the Environment Agency as the collection and dispersal of clean surface water to ground allows recharge aquifer units. It also can help to prevent localised flooding in heavy rainfall events. Approved Document Part H of the Building Regulations 2000 establishes a hierarchy for surface water disposal. As part of this hierarchy the first option is for the disposal of surface water via SUDS, which encourage infiltration such as soakaways or infiltration trenches. An appraisal of SUD options must be undertaken to ensure feasibility and/or suitability and it must be proven that they can be properly maintained and would not lead to any other environmental problems  \nThe use soakaways will always require a site specific investigation and risk assessment to assess suitability. There must be no discharge to land with is impacted by contamination and there must be no direct discharge to groundwater. As a rule of thumb we would accept roof drainage going to soakaway, but other surface drainage may need to go through treatment systems or to foul main, for instance vehicle parking. However discharge into the ground from car parking for less than 20 private cars is normally acceptable, provided there are suitable pollution prevention measures in the system prior to the discharge point and the groundwater is greater than 10 metres below final discharge level. We would not accept any vehicle parking drainage going to ground in an SPZ1.\n\nWhere the intention is to dispose to soakaway, these should be shown to work through an appropriate assessment carried out under Building Research Establishment (BRE) Digest 365.\n\nThe detailed design at any site can be negotiated on a site specific basis dependant on environmental setting and drainage design proposals. The following website is helpful in planning drainage design.\nhttp://www.bgs.ac.uk/products/hydrogeology/infiltrationSuds.html",
