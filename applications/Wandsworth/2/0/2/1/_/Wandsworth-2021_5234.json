  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed removal of 'Public Right of Way' and 'Access Point 9' (Mendip Gate) east of Ensign House and amalgamation of the public accessible land with Ensign Garden as part of `Private Amenity Areas� would result in the loss of a pedestrian access route between the Thames Path and Mendip and Chatfield Roads. The loss of the public route would diminish accessibility and connectivity in the location to the harm of the public realm, public access, walking networks and sustainable communities contrary to the NPPF (2021) and policies SI16, T2 and T3 of the London Plan (2021) and policies LP15 and LP58 of the Wandsworth Publication Version Local Plan (Regulation 19 version). The provision and retention of the public right of way in the existing planning obligation serves a useful purpose and that purpose would not be served equally well by the proposed modification.",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed modification of 'Public Access Areas' to make Ensign Garden 'Private Amenity Areas' with no public access would result in the loss of public open space to the harm of quality of life, health and well-being of the wider community, contrary to the NPPF (2021), policies GG2 (F), G4 and D8 of the London Plan (2021), policy PL4 of the Core Strategy (2016), policy DMO1 of the Development Management policies Document (2021) and policies LP1, LP15 and LP53 of the Wandsworth Publication Version Local Plan (Regulation 19 version). The provision and retention of Ensign Gardens as public open space in the existing planning obligation serves a useful purpose and that purpose would not be served equally well by the proposed modification. ",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed deletion of Clause 16.7 could result in the loss of the opportunity to secure access from Battersea Reach at `Mendip Gate� [Access Point 9 on Plan E] through the adjacent land to Mendip Road / Chatfield Road, should it be redeveloped. The loss of the public route would diminish accessibility and connectivity in the location to the harm of the public realm, public access, walking networks and sustainable communities contrary to the NPPF (2021), policies SI16, T2 and T3 of the London Plan (2021) and policies LP15 and LP58 of the Wandsworth Publication Version Local Plan (Regulation 19 version). It is considered that the obligation serves a useful purpose in the existing planning obligation and that purpose would not be served equally well by the proposed modification. ",
    "Reason : 4 - The proposed replacement Clause 16.1.2 of the Section 106 Agreement would fail to secure reasonable public access to the `Public Access Areas� within Battersea Reach as set out and agreed within the existing planning obligation. The potential loss of public access for `passive recreation� within Battersea Reach could result in harm to quality of life, health and well-being\r\nof the wider community, contrary to the NPPF (2021), policies GG2 (F), G4 and D8 of the London Plan (2021), policy PL4 of the Core Strategy (2016), policy DMO1 of the Development Management policies Document (2021) and policies LP1, LP15 and LP53 of the Wandsworth Publication Version Local Plan (Regulation 19 version). The provision and retention of public access area in the existing planning obligation serves a useful purpose and that purpose would not be served equally well by the proposed modification. ",
    "Reason : 5 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as parts of the proposals are clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
