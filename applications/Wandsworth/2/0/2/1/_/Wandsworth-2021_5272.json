  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The development would by reason of the conversion of a property consisting of less than 150square metres of existing habitable floorspace, which is not\r\nunsuitable for family accommodation, cause harm to the quality and mix of local housing stock. Furthermore, notwithstanding the refusal in principle, the\r\ndevelopment fails to provide at least one family-sized unit with access to a\r\ndedicated rear garden and the provision of one-bedroom units has not been limited to one. As such, the proposal would be contrary to policies DMH2 of the Development Management Policies Document (2016).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed two one-bedroom flats would fail to meet the minimum bedroom width requirements. Accordingly, the development provides a substandard level of accommodation for residential occupiers contrary to policies DMH4 and DMH6 of the Development Management Policies Document (2016) and Technical Housing StandardsNationally Described Space Standards (2015).",
    "Reason : 3 - Enforcement action:\r\nFor the reasons set out above it is considered expedient and in the public\r\ninterest to initiate formal enforcement action to secure removal of the two\r\nunauthorised flats and reinstatement of the single dwellinghouse. This action may consist of issue of an enforcement notice, prosecution proceedings and the taking of direct action pursuant to sections 172, 178 and 179 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended).\r",
    "Reason : 4 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
