  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development by reason of its location within a residential garden would result in an inappropriate form of development and lead to an intensification of a small site where national, regional and local planning policies makes a presumption against such development. Accordingly, the proposals would be contrary to the NPPF (2021), policies H1 and H2 of the London Plan (2021), policy DMH4 of the Development Management Policies Document  (2016) and the Housing SPD (2016).",
    "Reason : 2 - The development would by reason of its size and layout would fall below the minimum gross internal floor area as required by the Technical housing standards - nationally described space standard (2015). The proposal therefore fails to comply with policy D6 of the London Plan (2021), policies DMH4 and DMH6 of the Development Management Policies Document (2016), the Technical housing standards - nationally described space standard (2015) and the Housing SPD (2016).",
    "Reason : 3 - The applicant has failed to demonstrate the impact of the proposal and the continued health of the adjacent protected London plane tree which displays significant amenity value contributing positively to the streetscene of the location. In the absence of an arboricultural assessment that includes root exploration details, the proposed development within close proximity of the London plane tree is considered contrary to policy G7 of the London Plan (2021) and policy DMO5 of the  Development Management Policies Document (2016)\r\n",
    "Reason : 4 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
