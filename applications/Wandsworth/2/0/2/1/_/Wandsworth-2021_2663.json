    "Reason : 1 - The proposed telecommunications equipment would, by reason of its siting and appearance be visually intrusive, resulting in harm to the spatial character of the location, and would result in excessive clutter in the streetscene, harming the visual amenity of the area. The proposal would not meet with the conditions attached to the relevant Class A of Part 16 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order and would be contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2019) and the Local Plan, in particular policies DMS1, DMS9 and DMT1 of the Development Management Policies Document (2016).
