    "Reason : 1 - The proposed installation of external insulation with associated brick slips would result in the near total loss of the external historic fabric of the building, and the brick slips would not relate well to the materiality of the existing terrace given their finish and them protruding beyond the plane of the external elevations by 220mm.   This would cause less-than-substantial harm to the character, appearance and significance of Charlwood Road/Lifford Street Conservation Area, without there being justifiable public benefits to outweigh this harm, contrary to the provisions of the NPPF (2021) and policies DMS1, DMS2 and DMH5 of the Councils Development Management Policies Document (DMPD) (2016).  ",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
