    "Reason : 1 - The proposal constitutes development under the Town and Country Planning Act 1990, and the local planning authority is not satisfied that, based on the drawings submitted as part of the application, this proposal falls within any class of 'permitted development' specified within Schedule 2 to the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).\r\nINFORMATIVE: The proposed development includes external alterations, which are not provided for in the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended); it fails to comply with paragraph 3.(9A) of the Order, as the dwellinghouses do not comply with the nationally described space standard; and it fails to comply with paragraph MA.1.(1)(g) of Part 3, Schedule 2 of the Order, as it is of a description falling within Class O of Part 3 of the General Permitted Development Order as it had effect immediately before 1 August 2021 and a current article 4 direction prevents development under Class O.\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The development would not provide adequate natural light in all habitable rooms of the dwellinghouses, and, in consideration of the representations received, it would create unacceptable privacy impacts.\r\n"
