  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - By reason of its size, scale, and design, the proposed development would constitute an overly dominant, unsympathetic and incongruous form of development within the property frontage, and lead to the significant loss of historic original ancillary structures to the locally listed building. The proposed development would harm the character and appearance of the host locally listed building and the wider Park Town Estate Conservation Area. The development would be contrary to the NPPF (2021), Section 72(1) of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990, policy HC1(C) of the London Plan (2021), policy IS3 of the Wandsworth Core Strategy (2016), and policies DMS1, DMS2, DMH4 and DMH5 of the Wandsworth DMPD as well as the guidance within the Housing SPD (2016) and the Park Town Estate Conservation Area Appraisal and Management Strategy (2010).",
    "Reason : 2 - By reason of the design and layout, the proposed development would provide habitable rooms with significantly restricted outlook and therefore result in a poor standard of accommodation, detrimental to the amenities of future occupiers. Accordingly, the proposals would fail to comply with policies DMS1 and DMH4 of the DMPD (2016).",
    "Reason : 3 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably. In addition further guidance was offered to the applicant by the case officer during the processing of the application to identify amendments to address those elements of the scheme considered unacceptable. However, the necessary amendments to make the application acceptable are substantial and would materially change the development proposal. They would require further consultations to be undertaken prior to determination, which could not take place within the statutory determination period specified by the Department of Communities and Local Government. \r\n\r\n",
