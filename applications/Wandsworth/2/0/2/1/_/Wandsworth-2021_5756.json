    "Reason : 1 - The total loss of the existing front boundary wall, the erection of the replacement wall with gates by reason of their size, and the loss of significant amount of greening within the front garden including two trees, would cause undue harm to the visual amenity of the property and the streetscene as well as unacceptable harm to the character, appearance and heritage significance of Wandsworth Common Conservation Area contrary to the provisions of the NPPF and policies DMS1, DMS2 and DMO5 of the Councils adopted Development Management Policies Document (2016).  ",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
