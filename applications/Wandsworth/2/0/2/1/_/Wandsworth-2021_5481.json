  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposal, by reason of the level of proposed alterations to the front boundary treatment and occupation of the front yard with hardstanding, would harm the existing rhythm, unity, character and appearance of the streetscene and the Totterdown Fields Conservation Area.  As such, The development is therefore considered to cause less than substantial harm to the character and appearance of the conservation area, with no public benefit outlined, contrary to Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 and paragraphs 199, and 202 of the NPPF, as well as policies DMS1 and DMS2 of the DMPD (2016), the Housing SPD (2016) and Totterdown Fields Conservation Area Appraisal and Management Strategy.",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
