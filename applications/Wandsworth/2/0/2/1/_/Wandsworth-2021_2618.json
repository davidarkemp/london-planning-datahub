    "Reason : 1 - The proposed render to the front elevation would be harmful towards the host property and the setting, character and appearance of the wider streetscene within the Rusholme Road Conservation Area, contrary to the aims of the NPPF and of the London Plan and the Council's development plan policies, in particular, DMPD Policies DMS1, DMS2, DMH5 and the Rusholme Road Conservation Area Appraisal.  ",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
