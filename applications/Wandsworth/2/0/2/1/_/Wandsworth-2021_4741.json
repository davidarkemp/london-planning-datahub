    "Reason : 1 - The proposal constitutes development under the Town and Country Planning Act 1990, and the local planning authority is not satisfied that, based on the drawings submitted as part of the application, this proposal falls within any class of 'permitted development' specified within Schedule 2 to the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).\r\nINFORMATIVE: The proposal is not permitted development, under paragraph A.1(ja) of Part 1 of Schedule 2 of the Town and Country (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015, as any total enlargement (being the enlarged part together with any existing enlargement of the original dwellinghouse to which it will be joined) must not exceed the limits set out in sub-paragraphs (e) to (j);.the proposal would exceed the limits as set out in paragraph (h) as the two-storey rear addition extends beyond the rear wall of the original dwellinghouse by more than 3 metres. The proposal would also exceed the limits as set out in paragraph (j) as the two-storey rear addition is within 2 metres of the boundary of the curtilage of the dwellinghouse, and the height of the eaves of the enlarged part would exceed 3 metres\r\n\r\nThe proposal is also not permitted development, under paragraph B.1(d) of Part 1 of Schedule 2 of the Town and Country (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015, as the cubic content of the resulting roof space would exceed the cubic content of the original roof space by more than 40 cubic metres.
