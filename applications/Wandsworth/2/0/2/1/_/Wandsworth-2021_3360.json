    "Reason : 1 - By reason of its scale and siting the proposed development would unacceptably harm the setting of the Grade II Listed Buildings St Boniface Church and St Nicholas's Church, with insufficient public benefits to outweigh that harm. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Section 66(1) of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990, policy DMS2 of the Development Management Policies Document (2016), Policy HC1 of the London Plan (2021) and paragraph 202 of the NPPF (2021).\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
