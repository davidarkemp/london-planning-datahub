  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The development by reason of it is appearance, scale and siting represents a\r\nvisually obtrusive and incongruous addition that relates poorly to the host\r\nbuilding and is out of place with the prevailing character of shopfronts within the street. Therefore, it fails to integrate with its surroundings and detracts from the local spatial character and Tooting Town Centre. Furthermore, the development fails to provide access for people with disabilities. The development is therefore contrary to policy IS3 of the Core Strategy (2016), policies DMS1 and DMTS9 of the Development Management Policies Document (2016) and the Shopfronts SPG (1988). ",
    "Reason : 2 - Enforcement Action:\r\nFor the reasons set out above it is considered expedient and in the public interest to initiate formal enforcement action to secure removal of the unauthorised extension. This action may consist of issue of an enforcement notice and in the event of non-compliance, prosecution proceedings and the taking of direct action pursuant to sections 172, 178 and 179 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended).\r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
