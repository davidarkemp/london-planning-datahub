  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - By reason of the excessive scale, inappropriate design and siting, the proposed side roof extension would constitute an unsympathetic and incongruous form of development that would relate poorly to and dominate the host building while being visually conspicuous within the adjoining local streetscape. The proposed development would result in less than substantial harm to the character and appearance of the Totterdown Fields Conservation Area, for which no significant public benefits have been identified that would outweigh the harm caused to the special character and appearance of the conservation area. Accordingly, the proposals fail to conform to Section 72(1) of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990, the NPPF (2021), policy HC1 of the London Plan (2021), policies DMS1, DMS2 and DMH5 of the Development Management Policies Document (2016), the Wandsworth Housing SPD (2016) and the Totterdown Fields Conservation Area Appraisal & Management Strategy (2008).",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably. In addition further guidance was offered to the applicant by the case officer during the processing of the application to identify amendments to address those elements of the scheme considered unacceptable. However, the necessary amendments to make the application acceptable are substantial and would materially change the development proposal. They would require further consultations to be undertaken prior to determination, which could not take place within the statutory determination period specified by the Department of Communities and Local Government. \r\n"
