    "Condition : 1 - The development hereby permitted shall be begun within 3 years from the date of this permission.\r\nReason: To prevent the accumulation of unimplemented planning permissions and to comply with Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended) and to meet the requirements of Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004 and to meet the requirements of The Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015.\r\n",
    "Condition : 2 - The development shall be carried out in accordance with the reports, specifications and drawings detailed [002; 003; 004; 005; 006A and 007]. \r\nReason: To ensure a satisfactory standard of development and to allow the local planning authority to review any potential changes to the scheme. \r\n",
    "Condition : 3 - All external materials, including [brickwork, roof tiles, window frames], used in the construction of the development hereby approved shall match the type, texture, tone, colour, size and profile of those used on the existing building and shall be retained permanently. The bricks should exactly match the existing house and the brickwork should be built in a matching bond using lime mortar. The pointing should be flush and rag-finished to give a traditional appearance. The roof should be covered in matching clay Courtrai pantiles. The window on the front elevation of the extension should be a timber sash or flush casement to match one of the original timber windows found on houses on the Dover House Estate. This should incorporate Georgian glazing bars mounted externally and the beading and spacer bars should be white to match the frames. The sliding doors to the rear should be timber or metal. \r\nReason: In the interests of the appearance of the locality, in accordance with Council policy DMS1 of the Development Management Policies Document (adopted March 2016) coupled with the requirements of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021. \r\n",
    "Condition : 4 - INFORMATIVE: In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework 2021 to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application.  The Council has made available detailed advice in the form of its statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning Documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre-application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably. In addition, where appropriate, further guidance was offered to the applicant during the processing of the application.  "
