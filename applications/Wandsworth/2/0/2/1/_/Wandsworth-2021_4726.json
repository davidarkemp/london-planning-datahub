  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - By reason of its scale, height, design and bulk, the proposal would constitute an unsympathetic and prominent form of development that would relate poorly to the host property and neighbouring properties to the detriment of the spatial character of the location and appearance of the streetscene. The development has not overcome the previous reason for refusal and would fail to positively contribute to the character of the area and would be contrary to policy IS3 of the Core Strategy (2016) and policy DMS1 of the Development Management Policies Document (2016). \r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The application has not been accompanied by a robust sequential test to demonstrate justification for office (Class E) use outside of the areas identified within the adopted Employment and Industry Document (2018). In addition, the site is not located within a designated strategic reservoir of industrial land for storage (Class B8) use . As such, the proposal would be contrary to the NPPF (2021) and policies EI2 and EI3 of the adopted Employment and Industry Document (2018). ",
    "Reason : 3 - By reason of the scale, design and location of the windows facing the rear of Upper Tooting Road and Beechcroft properties, the development would result in harm to the privacy of the neighbouring residential occupiers through overlooking. The development has not overcome the previous reason for refusal and would be contrary to policy DMS1 of Development Management Policies Document (2016).\r\n",
    "Reason : 4 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
