    "Reason : 1 - The proposed dwelling by reason of its design, scale and bulk would fail to physically integrate with its surroundings and would detract from local spatial character. The dwelling would form a visually intrusive and unsympathetic feature that would result in harm to the open setting between 1a Bennerley Road and 94 Bolingbroke Grove, the Bennerley Road streetscene and character and appearance of the Wandsworth Common Conservation Area. Therefore the development would contravene the objectives of policies DMS1 and DMS2 of the Wandsworth's Development Management Policies Document (2016) and the Supplementary Planning Document: Housing (2016). \r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed development by reason of its scale and height would be an unneighbourly form of development as it would be unduly overbearing, lead to harmful loss of outlook and the application has also failed to demonstrate that there would not be unacceptable harm to neighbouring windows in respect to reductions in daylight. Therefore, the proposal would be contrary to policy DMS1 of the DMPD (2016) and the Supplementary Planning Document: Housing (2016).\r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably. In addition further guidance was offered to the applicant by the case officer during the processing of the application to identify amendments to address those elements of the scheme considered unacceptable. However, the necessary amendments to make the application acceptable are substantial and would materially change the development proposal. They would require further consultations to be undertaken prior to determination, which could not take place within the statutory determination period specified by the Department of Communities and Local Government. You are therefore encouraged to consider submission of a fresh application incorporating the material amendments set out below which are necessary to make the scheme acceptable. \r\n\r\nRequired amendments:\r\n- Reduce the scale and height of the development. \r\n"
