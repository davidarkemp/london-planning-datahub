    "Reason : 1 - The proposed illuminated advertisement would by reason of its height, size and prominent location would result in a visually intrusive and unsympathetic feature to the existing property and the streetscape to the detriment of the local visual amenity. In addition, the proposal would cause less than substantial harm to the special architectural and historic interest of the setting of the Grade I listed Gala Bingo Club (formerly The Granada Cinema). Due to the location, scale and illumination, the proposed advertisement would be an obtrusive form of development that would result in harm to the amenity of neighbouring occupiers. The proposal has not overcome the previous reason for refusal and would therefore be contrary to policies DMS1, DMS2 and DMS8 of the Development Management Policies Document (2016) and paragraphs 136 and 202 of the NPPF 2021."
