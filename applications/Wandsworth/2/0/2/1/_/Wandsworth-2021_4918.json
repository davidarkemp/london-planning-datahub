  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development by reason of its excessive scale, prominent and unsympathtic design, would result in harm to the appearance of the host building and local spatial character. The proposal therefore fails to comply with policies DMS1 and DMH5 of the Development Management Policies Document (2016), and the guidance within the Housing SPD (2016).\r\n\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed development, by reason of its overt scale and design, would result in an unneighbourly form of development to the harm of the amenities of neighbouring occupiers in terms of increased overshadowing, noise, disturbance, loss of privacy and appearing overbearing. The proposal therefore fails to comply with policy DMS1 of the Development Management Policies Document (2016), and the guidance within the Housing SPD (2016).\r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed development by reason of insufficient unit size and design, would result in harm to the amenities of future occupiers by way of restricted internal layout, outlook, and natural light. The proposed units would also fail to provide adequate sizes of dedicated external amenity space for the new units. The proposal therefore fails to comply with policies DMS1, DMH4, DMH6 and DMH7 of the Development Management Policies Document (2016), and the guidance within the Housing SPD (2016).\r\n",
    "Reason : 4 - The proposed development, by reason of a lack of identified suitable cycle and waste storage locations, would result in inadequate means of sustainable transport provision and adverse waste management on site. The proposal therefore fails to comply with policies DMT2 and DMS1 of the Development Management Policies Document (2016), and the guidance within the Refuse and recyclables in developments SPD (2014).",
    "Reason : 5 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
