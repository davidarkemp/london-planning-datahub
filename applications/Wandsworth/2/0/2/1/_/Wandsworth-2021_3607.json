    "Reason : 1 - The proposed telecommunications mast and associated equipment would by reason of its siting and appearance be of an overly dominant, overbearing and visually intrusive scale and design, resulting in undue and excessive clutter in the open streetscene, harming the visual amenities and spatial character of the locality, and the setting and character of the adjoining Tooting Common Metropolitan Open Land and locally listed heritage asset. The proposal would not meet with the relevant conditions attached to Class A of Part 16 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order and would be contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policies SI6 of the London Plan (2021), policy IS3 of the Wandsworth Core Strategy (2016), policies DMS1, DMS2, DMS9 and DMO1 of the Wandsworth Development Management Policies Document (2016).",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. \r\n"
