  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposal, by reason of its location within an existing residential garden, would not be an appropriate form of development where national, regional and local planning policies makes presumption against such development due to the harm to the local spatial character that would occur, as in this case. Furthermore, by reason of their scale, form, siting and appearance the development would form a prominent and incongruous feature that would result in a harmful impact to the character and appearance of the surrounding area, including the open rear garden setting of Longley Road and the locally listed building at no.46 Longley Road. The proposed development has not overcome the previous reason for refusal and would conflict with the NPPF (2021), policies H1 and D3 of the London Plan (2021), policies PL1 and IS3 of the Core Strategy (2016) and policies DMS1, DMS2 and DMH4a of the Development Management Policies Document (2016) and the Housing SPD (2016).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed two-storey houses by reason of their scale, design and proximity to the boundary with the neighbouring properties would be an unneighbourly form of development that would result in harm to amenity adjoining occupiers by being intrusive, overbearing and resulting in loss of privacy through overlooking. The submitted information has also failed to demonstrate that there would not be unacceptable harm to neighbouring windows and gardens in respect to reductions in daylight and sunlight. The proposal has not overcome the previous reason for refusal and therefore fails to comply with policy DMS1 of the Wandsworth Development Management Policies Document (2016) and guidance contained in the Housing SPD (2016).",
    "Reason : 3 - By reason of the size and proposed level of occupancy, the proposed residential units would fail to meet minimum floor space requirements for the single bedrooms and the proposal fails to demonstrate appropriate ceiling height. The proposal is therefore contrary to policy DMH6 of the Development Management Policies Document (2016) and the Technical Housing Standards-Nationally Described Space Standards (2015).",
    "Reason : 4 - In the absence of a Flood Risk Assessment, Sequential and Exception tests it has not been demonstrated that the proposal would be an appropriate form of development at this location and would not be at risk from flooding or result in increased risk of flooding in the surrounding area. The proposal has not overcome the previous reason for refusal and is therefore contrary to the NPPF (2021) and policy DMS5 (Flood Risk Management) of the Development Management Policies Document (2016).",
    "Reason : 5 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
