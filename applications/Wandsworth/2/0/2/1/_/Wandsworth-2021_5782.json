    "Reason : 1 - The proposal is stated to be ancillary for the use of the existing residents within the site curtilage. If this were the case, in accessing and exiting a facility with no controlled operating hours throughout the day and night, a degree of activity would be created that would result in noise and disturbance to existing adjacent residential occupiers that would be to demonstrably harmful levels. The proposal therefore fails to comply with policy DMS1 of the Wandsworth Development Management Policies Document (2016), in conjunction with policies LP1 and LP2 of the Wandsworth Publication Version Local Plan (Regulation 19 Version) (2022). \r\n\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposal comprises a mixture of uses that have been stated to be ancillary and for the enjoyment of residents within the curtilage of the site. No legal mechanisms have been proposed in order to ensure that only residents would be capable of using the facility. In this regard, these mixture of uses that would be capable of being used by the wider community is to be regarded as an independent sui generis use providing commercial activity. The introduction of such a proposed commercial facility would intensify activity within a residential shared garden setting that would be inappropriate and harmful to the amenities of existing and adjacent residential occupiers, while being inappropriately located outside of a town centre. The proposed development would conflict with policies DMS1 and DMTS2 of the Wandsworth Development Management Policies Document (2016), and policies LP1 and LP43 of the Wandsworth Publication Version Local Plan (Regulation 19 Version) (2022).",
    "Reason : 3 - The introduction of a proposed commercial facility would lead to the inappropriate and unjustified loss of rear residential garden space, causing harm to the existing open green space and local spatial character. The proposed development would conflict with policy DMH1 of the Wandsworth Development Management Policies Document (2016), policies LP25 of the Wandsworth Publication Version Local Plan (Regulation 19 Version) (2022), and the guidance within the Wandsworth Housing Supplementary Planning Document (2016).",
    "Reason : 4 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably. \r\n"
