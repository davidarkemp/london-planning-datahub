    "Reason : 1 - By reason of scale, massing and location, the proposed extensions to the roof and the increased ridge height would constitute an unsympathetic and over prominent form of development with public views of the front and the rear of the host property available from Octavia Street and Orbel Street. The proposal would therefore detract from the generally unaltered roofscape of this immediate locality and thus fail to preserve or enhance the character of the Three Sisters Conservation Area. The development would be contrary to the policies DMS1, DMS2 and DMH5 of the Development Management Policies Document (2016); policies LP1, LP3 and LP5 of the Publication Version (Reg 19) Local Plan (Jan 2022); and the guidance within the Housing SPD (2016), the Historic Environment SPD (2016) and the Three Sisters Conservation Area Appraisal & Management Strategy. ",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
