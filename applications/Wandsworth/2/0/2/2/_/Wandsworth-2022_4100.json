  "description": "Alterations, including partial demolition (retrospective) and rebuilding of existing three-storey building with the addition of a further two-storey upward extension on topl, in connection with the provision of flexible Class 'E' commercial use, including office accommodation/employment hub, together with a caf�/restaurant space at ground floor and roof level, associated soft and hard landscaping, upgrading of central courtyard and provision of a roof top garden, provision of car parking spaces, cycle parking spaces, refuse storage and other associated works.",
  "decision_date": "23/01/2023",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development, by reason of the additional infill extension proposed at first floor level on the Deodar Road elevation, would lead to an unacceptable increase in the bulk and massing onto the Deodar Road frontage resulting in an overbearing and unneighbourly form of development that would fail to ensure a high level of physical integration with its immediate surroundings, contrary to the Council's development plan policies, in particular, policy DMS1.",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably. In addition further guidance was offered to the applicant by the case officer during the processing of the application to identify amendments to address those elements of the scheme considered unacceptable. However, the necessary amendments to make the application acceptable are substantial and would materially change the development proposal. They would require further consultations to be undertaken prior to determination, which could not take place within the statutory determination period specified by the Department of Communities and Local Government. You are therefore encouraged to consider submission of a fresh application incorporating the material amendments set out below which are necessary to make the scheme acceptable. \n\nRemove additional extension at first floor level onto Deodar Road frontage."
