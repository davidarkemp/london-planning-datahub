    "Reason : 1 - By reason of its scale, siting and massing, it is considered that the scale of the proposed addition would be excessive, and would give the building a 'top heavy' appearance, that would dominate the low level adjacent terraced housing, and a building of the proposed height and massing would not be appropriate in this context, contrary to Site Allocation reference 99D as identified within the Councils adopted Site Specific Allocations Document, Policy DMS 1 of the DMPD and London Plan policies D1, D2 and D4.",
    "Reason : 2 - By reason of its siting and location, the proposed refuse and recycling storage area would be poorly accessible to building occupants and collectors, whilst restricting access to the cycle store. The proposed refuse and recycling storage is therefore considered to be inadequate, contrary to Policy DMS1 of the DMPD and the Councils Refuse and recyclables SPD (2014).",
    "Reason : 3 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
