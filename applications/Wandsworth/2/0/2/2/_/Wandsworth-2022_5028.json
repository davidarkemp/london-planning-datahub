    "Reason : 1 - The proposed extension, due to its scale, bulk and design, would be inappropriate, failing to integrate with and unduly dominating the host property, detrimental to its character and appearance and that of the vicinity, contrary to adopted policy, in particular policies DMS1 and DMH5 of the Development Management Policy Document (adopted March 2016) and the objectives of the 'Housing' SPD (adopted November 2016). ",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably. However, the necessary amendments to make the application acceptable are substantial and would materially change the development proposal. They would require further consultations to be undertaken prior to determination, which could not take place within the statutory determination period specified by the Department of Communities and Local Government. You are therefore encouraged to consider submission of a fresh application incorporating the material amendments set out below which are necessary to make the scheme acceptable. \r\n\r\nRequired amendments:\r\nReduce the length of the proposed extension and amend the design to reduce its bulk. \r\n"
