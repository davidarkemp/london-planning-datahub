    "Condition : 1 - This notice indicates that the proposed development would comply with Class A of Schedule 2 Part 1 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 2015 (as amended).  If you would like confirmation that the proposed development would be lawful, then you should submit an (optional) application to the local planning authority for a Lawful Development Certificate.\r\nIt is a requirement of condition A.4 (11) that the development shall be carried out in accordance with the details approved by the Local Planning Authority.\r\nThe materials used in any exterior work (other than materials used in the construction of a conservatory) must be of a similar appearance to those used in the construction of the exterior of the existing dwellinghouse.",
    "Condition : 2 - Prior to completion of the development the window in the side elevation at first floor level of the development shall be obscure-glazed and non-opening (unless the parts of the window which can be opened are more than 1.7 metres above the floor of the room in which the window is installed).  The window shall so be maintained and retained as such. \r\nReason: To control overlooking and safeguard the privacy of neighbours in accordance with Council policy DMS1(c) of the Development Management Policies Document (adopted March 2016) coupled with the requirements of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021.\r\n",
    "Condition : 3 - INFORMATIVE: You are reminded that this notice is issued on the basis of the physical circumstances prevailing at the property when the application was made.  If any other extension is undertaken BEFORE the construction of the extension, then this notice would no longer be applicable and planning permission may be required for the development presently proposed.\r\n",
    "Condition : 4 - INFORMATIVE: You are advised that this notice does not override your responsibilities under the Party Wall Act 1996.\r\n",
    "Condition : 5 - INFORMATIVE: This notice is based on the drawings and any other information as submitted being a true reflection of the physical circumstances prevailing at the site on the date of the submission of the application. If the existing conditions are different from those shown on the drawings or if the drawings or any other information are inaccurate in any way, the notice may not be valid.\r\n"
