    "Reason : 1 - The proposal constitutes development under the Town and Country Planning\r\nAct 1990, and the local planning authority is not satisfied that, based on the\r\ndrawings submitted as part of the application, this proposal falls within any class of 'permitted development' specified within Schedule 2 to the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).\r\n\r\nThe site of the proposed development is located partially within a conservation area and also within a within 3 km of the perimeter of an aerodrome that is used by aircraft engaged in the public transport of passengers and therefore the development would fail to comply with Class A.1.(o)(i) and (vii), Part 20, Schedule 2 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 2015 (GDPO) as amended.\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - INFORMATIVE: Notwithstanding the failure of the proposed development to comply with the GPDO in relation to the above, the proposed development by reason its appearance, design, scale and height would constitute a prominent, incongruous and inappropriate form of development, which would appear overly dominant to the harm of the character and appearance of the host property and streetscene. It would also harm the setting of the nearby listed buildings and conservation area. As such, the proposal would have failed to comply with Class A.2.(1)(e), Part 20, Schedule 2 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 2015 (GDPO) as amended, in addition to the NPPF (2021), policy IS3 of the Core Strategy (2016), policies DMS1 and DMS2 of the Development Management Policies Document (2016) and the guidance within the Housing SPD (2016). ",
    "Reason : 3 - Furthermore, the proposal has also failed to demonstrate that there would not be unacceptable harm to neighbouring windows in respect to reductions in daylight and sunlight. As such, the proposal would have failed to comply with Class A.2.(1)(g), Part 20, Schedule 2 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 2015 (GDPO) as amended, in addition to the NPPF (2021) and policy DMS1 of the Development Management Policies Document (2016) and the guidance within the Housing SPD (2016)."
