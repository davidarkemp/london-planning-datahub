  "description": "T4 - Oak - Fell The tree works are proposed to stop the influence of the tree(s) on the soil below building foundation level and provide long term stability. Estimated costs of repair to the building are ???68k if the influence of the tree(s) remain and ???4.3k if the proposed tree works are allowed to proceed. Granting permission will limit these costs. In the event of a refusal we, or our clients, will seek to secure compensation for the additional costs incurred through Section 202(e). Should the tree/s remain the total cost of repairs will be the Superstructural repairs + Alternative method of repairs = ???72.3k It is the expert opinion of both the case engineer and arboriculturalist that on the balance of probabilities the supporting information demonstrates the influence of the tree(s). Note: Further monitoring results may be submitted if these become available during the course of this application.",
