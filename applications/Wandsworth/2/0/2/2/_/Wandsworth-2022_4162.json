  "decision_date": "09/01/2023",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development, by reason of its location, design, removal of heritage features and a frontage that would be dominated by parking, results in a detrimental and unacceptable appearance to the host building, eroding the local spatial character of the local streetscape, thus failing to preserve the character and appearance of the Heaver Estate Conservation Area. The development is therefore contrary the NPPF (2021), Section 72(1) of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990, policies DMS1, DMS2, and DMH5 of the Wandsworth DMPD (2016), policies LP1, LP3 and LP5 of the Wandsworth Publication Version Local Plan (Regulation 19 version) (2022), as well as the guidance within the Housing SPD (2016) and the Heaver Estate Conservation Area Appraisal & Management Strategy (2010).",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
