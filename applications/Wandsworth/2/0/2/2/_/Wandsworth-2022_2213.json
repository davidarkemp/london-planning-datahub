    "Reason : 1 - The proposal, by reason of the projecting depth of the front lightwell into its existing garden and the failure to retain a minimum depth of 2m of the front garden with the site being in a conservation area, would result in the permanent loss of a landscaped area thus compromising the opportunity of the enhancement of this space in between and around the host building. Furthermore, the front lightwell would be an incongruous feature out of keeping within the streetscene. The proposal is therefore considered to result in harm to the host property and the wider character and appearance of the Battersea Park Conservation Area and is contrary to the NPPF (2021), policies DMS1, DMS2 and DMH5 of the Development Management Policies Document (2016), emerging PVLP policies LP1, LP3, LP5 and LP6 and Wandsworth Housing SPD (2016). ",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
