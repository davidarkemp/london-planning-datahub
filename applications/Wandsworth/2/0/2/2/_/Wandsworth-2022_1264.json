    "Reason : 1 - The removal of the condition is unacceptable as it would be likely to result in adverse impact on the visual amenity and character and apperance of the building, streetscene and adjacent conservation area and heritage assets, together with the potential for harm to the amenity of residents, by eliminating the control of installation of structures on the roof.\r\nThe proposal therefore fails to comply with policies DMS1 and DMS2 of the Development Management Policies Document (2016).",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
