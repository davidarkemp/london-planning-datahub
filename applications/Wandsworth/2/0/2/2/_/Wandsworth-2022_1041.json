    "Reason : 1 - The proposed roof terraces with glass balustrades when considered cumulatively with the approved first and second floor level balustrades would cause harm to the appearance of the existing building and less than substantial harm to the character, appearance and significance of Wandsworth Town Conservation Area, contrary to the provisions of policies DMS1, DMS2 and DMH5 of the Councils adopted Development Management Policies Document (2016).  ",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed roof terraces would result in direct overlooking into a neighbouring residential property contrary to the provisions of policy DMS1 of the Councils adopted Development Management Policies Document (2016).  ",
    "Reason : 3 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
