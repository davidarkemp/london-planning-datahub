  "description": "Excavation to enlarge basement with formation of lightwell to rear. Erection of a part single and part three-storey rear extension. Erection of a dormer extension to main rear roof slope with French doors and safety railing. Alterations internally with reconfiguration forming 1 x 2-bedroom and 3 x 1-bedroom flats.",
  "decision_date": "09/01/2023",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - By reason of their scale, form and siting it is considered that the proposed additions at roof level would constitute  incongruous and over dominant features that would disrupt the original roof form of the application property and adjacent properties in this location which is highly visible from the street. The public benefit of a contribution to the housing supply is not considered sufficient to outweigh the harm identified given only three additional residential units would be provided. The proposal would therefore cause harm to the character and appearance of the existing property and the wider conservation area, contrary to paragraph 4.165 of the Housing SPD, DMS1, DMS2 and DMH5, Section 72 (1) of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990, Policy HC1 (C) of the London Plan (2021) and paragraphs 199 and 202 of the NPPF (2021).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed third floor flat (flat 4), as indicated on the submitted section drawings and floor plans would have a floor to ceiling height of at least 2.3m for only approximately 52% of it gross internal area, which would be well below the 75% required under the NDSS. It is therefore considered that the proposed flat 4 would provide a substandard level of accommodation, in detriment to residential amenity, contrary to policy DMH4 of the DMPD, policy D6 of the London Plan and The Nationally Described Space Standards.",
    "Reason : 3 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably. In addition further guidance was offered to the applicant by the case officer during the processing of the application to identify amendments to address those elements of the scheme considered unacceptable. However, the necessary amendments to make the application acceptable are substantial and would materially change the development proposal. They would require further consultations to be undertaken prior to determination, which could not take place within the statutory determination period specified by the Department of Communities and Local Government. You are therefore encouraged to consider submission of a fresh application incorporating the material amendments set out below which are necessary to make the scheme acceptable. \r\n\r\nRequired amendments:\r\n-Remove proposed addition above the existing back addition\r\n-Amend design of rear mansard roof addtion to main roof\r\n-Ensure all residential units have a minimum floor to ceiling height of 2.5m for at least 75 per cent of the Gross Internal Area of each dwelling\r\n"
