  "description": "Determination as to whether prior approval is required for the installation of 18m high telecommunication mast with cabinet base, 3 x equipment cabinets and associated works.",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed telecommunications mast and associated equipment would by reason of its siting and appearance be of an overly dominant and visually intrusive scale and design, resulting in excessive clutter in the streetscene, harming the spatial character of the location and the visual amenities of neighbouring residents. The prominent, bulky and unsightly apparatus would result in harm to the setting and character of the nearby Grade II*listed Battersea Park and the Battersea Park Conservation Area. The proposal would not meet with the relevant conditions attached to the Class A of Part 16 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order and would be contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Sections 66 (1) and 72(1) of the Planning (Listed Building and Conservation Areas) Act 1990, policies HC1 and SI6 of the London Plan (2021), policy IS3 of the Wandsworth Core Strategy (2016), policies DMS1, DMS2 and DMS9 of the Wandsworth Development Management Policies Document (2016).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed telecommunications mast and associated equipment would by reason of its siting and scale, create an unnecessary obstruction of the public space, which would hinder the convenient and safe passage of pedestrians, given the demands placed on it. The proposal would not meet with the relevant conditions attached to the Class A of Part 16 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order and would be contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policies T1 and ST4 of the London Plan (2021), policy IS3 of the Wandsworth Core Strategy (2016), policies DMS1, DMS9 and DMT1 of the Wandsworth Development Management Policies Document (2016).",
    "Reason : 3 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
