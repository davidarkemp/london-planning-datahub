    "Reason : 1 - The proposal, by reason of its bulk and scale, with particular reference to the returning Bennerley Road elevation, would result in a dominant form of development to the detriment of the spatial character of the streetscape. The proposal is considered contrary to Policy PL1 (Attractive and distinctive neighbourhoods and regeneration initiatives) of the Wandsworth Local Plan Core Strategy 2016 and Policies DM1 (General development principles) and DMH4 (Residential development including conversions) of the Wandsworth Local Plan Development Management Planning Document 2016 and the Wandsworth Housing SPD 2016, along with the NPPF 2021. ",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably. In addition further guidance was offered to the applicant by the case officer during the processing of the application to identify amendments to address those elements of the scheme considered unacceptable. However, the necessary amendments to make the application acceptable are substantial and would materially change the development proposal. They would require further consultations to be undertaken prior to determination, which could not take place within the statutory determination period specified by the Department of Communities and Local Government."
