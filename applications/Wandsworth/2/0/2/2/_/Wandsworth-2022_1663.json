    "Reason : 1 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal.",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed extension and replacment roof tiles by reason of its scale, siting and design would result in undue harm to the visual amenity and character and appearance of the property and wider area. The proposal would be contrary to policies DMS1, DMH5, the NPPF 2021 and the London Plan. \r\n\r\n"
