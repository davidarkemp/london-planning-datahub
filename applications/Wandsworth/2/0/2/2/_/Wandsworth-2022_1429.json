    "Reason : 1 - By reason of the scale and extent of built from proposed in comparison to the existing level of development on site, the proposal would reduce the area of green open space on the site, with no replacement or compensatory provision provided, contrary to NPPF paragraph 99, DMPD policy DMO1 and Emerging Policy LP53, with the resultant harm to visual amenity and loss of potential space for informal recreation.\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - By reason of the proposed loss of existing allotments/food growing spaces, with insufficient details of replacement food growing space, the Council is not satisfied that the loss of the existing allotments which provide, visual, recreational and mental wellbeing value would be sufficiently mitigated against contrary to Policy G8 of the London Plan and Policy LP21 of the emerging Local Plan.",
    "Reason : 3 - By reason of the proposed loss of an existing community facility, the lack of \r\nappropriate alternative facilities for existing users of the site and the failure to \r\ndemonstrate a clear need for the proposed replacement community facility, the proposed development would result in the unacceptable loss of an existing facility of value to the local community, contrary to Policy DMC 2 of the DMPD, Policy IS 6 of the Core Strategy and Policy LP17 of the Emerging Local Plan.",
    "Reason : 4 - By reason of the proposed change of use which is anticipated to be more noise intensive for longer periods and inadequate information provided in relation to proposed noise mitigation measures, it is considered that the proposed development would have an unacceptable noise impact on neighbouring residents in significant detriment to neighbour amenity contrary to Policy DMS 1 of the Councilï¿½s Development Management Policies Document and Emerging Policy LP2.",
    "Reason : 5 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
