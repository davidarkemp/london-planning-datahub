  "description": "Alteration including erection of two storey rear extension above single-storey back addition in connection with creation of 1 x1 bedroom flat; erection of replacement dormer to main rear roof slope.",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed rear extension by reason of its size, siting and design would compete with and dominate the appearance of the host property and it would be a highly prominent and incongruous addition to the street scene that would fail to accord with local spatial character, contrary to the provisions of policies DMS1 and DMH5 of the Councils adopted Development Management Policies Document (2016).  ",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed rear extension would be reason of its size and siting have an unacceptable impact upon the amenity of residential occupiers at No. 197 which adjoins to the north, in terms of loss of daylight and outlook, contrary to the provisions of policy DMS1 paragraph C of the Councils adopted Development Management Policies Document (2016).  ",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed dwelling by reason of its size would provide a poor standard of residential accommodation contrary to the provisions of policy DMH6 the Councils adopted Development Management Policies Document (2016) and the Nationally Described Space Standards. ",
    "Reason : 4 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
