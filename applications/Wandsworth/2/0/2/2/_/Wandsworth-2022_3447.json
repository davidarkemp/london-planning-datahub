    "Reason : 2 - The proposed development would not comply with the provisions of  Schedule 2, Part 1, Class A conditions (g) and (ja) of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended). This is because the proposed steps down from the extension into the rear garden are also considered to be part of the enlargement to the dwellinghouse. Therefore, this brings the total extension beyond the original rear wall of the dwelling house to approximately 6.8m."
