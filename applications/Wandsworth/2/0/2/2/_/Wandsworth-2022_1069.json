    "Reason : 1 - The proposal constitutes development under the Town and Country Planning Act 1990, and the local planning authority is not satisfied that, based on the drawings submitted as part of the application, this proposal falls within any class of 'permitted development' specified within Schedule 2 to the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).\r\nINFORMATIVE: The application has not been accompanied with any information to demonstrate compliance with parts (a) to (d) of MA.2, Part 3 of Schedule 2 of the General Permitted Development Order and as such, has been refused in accordance with part (3)(b) of Section W (3) (b)",
    "Reason : 2 - By reason of a failure to provide a recent and adequate flood risk assessment (including Sequential and Exception tests), the development fails to demonstrate that the proposed change of use to a residential dwelling would not result in unacceptable flood risk for future occupiers for a ground floor property located within Flood Zone 2. The proposal therefore fails to comply with condition MA.2.(2)(c) of Part 3, Class MA, Schedule 2 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 2015 (as amended), policy SI12 of the London Plan (2021), policy PL 2 of the Wandsworth Core Strategy (2016) and policy DMS5 of the Wandsworth Development Management Policies Document (2016).",
    "Reason : 3 - By reason of a failure to provide a recent and adequate contamination report, the development fails to demonstrate that the proposed change of use to a residential dwelling would not result in unacceptable contamination risks for future occupiers. The proposal therefore fails to comply with condition MA.2.(2)(b) of Part 3, Class MA, Schedule 2 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 2015 (as amended), IS4 of the Wandsworth Core Strategy (2016) and policy DMS1 of the Wandsworth Development Management Policies Document (2016).",
    "Reason : 4 - By reason of a failure to provide a recent and adequate transport assessment the development fails to demonstrate that the proposed change of use to a residential dwelling would not result in unacceptable impact upon parking stressa and the existing road network. The proposal therefore fails to comply with condition MA.2.(2)(a) of Part 3, Class MA, Schedule 2 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 2015 (as amended), policy T4 of the London Plan (2021), policy PL 3 of the Wandsworth Core Strategy (2016) and policy DMT1 of the Wandsworth Development Management Policies Document (2016)."
