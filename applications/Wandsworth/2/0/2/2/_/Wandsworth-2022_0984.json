    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development, by virtue of its location within the takeaway restriction 400 metre buffer zone of 3 primary schools located at Chesterton Primary School, the Harris Academy Battersea and the Dominie would contribute to the creation of an unhealthy food environment, contrary to Policy E9 of the London Plan (2021), policy DMTS1 of the Development Management Policies Document (2016), guidance within the Town Centre Uses SPD (2015), together with draft policy LP15 of the Local Plan Publication (Reg 19) Version (2022). ",
    "Reason : 2 - A Flood Risk Assessment has not been provided to address flood risk management and therefore the propsals fail to accorde with policy DMS5 of the Development Management Policies Document (2016) and draft policy LP12 of the Local Plan Publication (Reg 19) Version (2022). ",
    "Reason : 3 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
