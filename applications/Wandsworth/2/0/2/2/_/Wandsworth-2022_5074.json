    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development, by reason of its inappropriate materials, resultant loss of original character features and inappropriate form and massing would cause harm to and completely alter the character and appearance of the application property which is considered to make a positive contribution to the character and appearance of the conservation area. The proposal would therefore cause less than substantial harm to the character and appearance of the conservation area, by failing to preserve or enhance the character, appearance and Heritage significance of the Victoria Drive Conservation Area. No public benefits put forward are considered sufficient to outweigh the harm identified. The proposal would therefore be contrary to policies IS3 of the Core Strategy (March 2016); DMS1; DMS2 and DMH5 of the Development Management Policies Document (March 2016) and the Housing SPD (November 2016), Policy HC1 of the London Plan, coupled with the requirements of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021.",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
