    "Reason : 1 - The development would by reason of its scale, siting and design would dominate and compete with the original building and relate poorly to neighbouring properties being visually intrusive and incongruous in its setting. The proposal therefore fails to comply with policies DMS1 and DMH5, the guidance of the Housing SPD (2016) and policies LP1 and LP5 of the Publication Version Local Plan Reg.19 (2022).",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the design of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
