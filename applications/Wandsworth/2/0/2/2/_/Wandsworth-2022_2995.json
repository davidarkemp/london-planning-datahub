    "Reason : 1 - The extract flue, by reason of its position and size, would result in food odours being discharged within close proximity neighbouring residential windows to the detriment of the amenities afforded to occupants of these properties. As such, the proposal is considered contrary to Policy DMS1 (c) of the Wandsworth Borough Council Development Management Policies Document 2016 and emerging policy LP2 (b) of the Publication Version Local Plan (Regulation 19 Version) (2022).\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The applicant has failed to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Council that the development would ensure that neighbouring occupiers are protected from noise disturbance and therefore the proposal fails to accord with Policy DMS1 (c) the Wandsworth Borough Council Development Management Policies Document 2016 and emerging policy LP2 (b) of the Publication Version Local Plan (Regulation 19 Version) (2022).\r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably. In addition further guidance was offered to the applicant by the case officer during the processing of the application to identify amendments to address those elements of the scheme considered unacceptable. However, the necessary amendments to make the application acceptable are substantial and would materially change the development proposal. They would require further consultations to be undertaken prior to determination, which could not take place within the statutory determination period specified by the Department of Communities and Local Government. You are therefore encouraged to consider submission of a fresh application incorporating the material amendments set out below which are necessary to make the scheme acceptable. \r\n\r\nAmendments: Revise design/location of extract flue; Provide noise impact assessment. \r\n"
