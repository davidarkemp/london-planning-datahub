    "Reason : 1 - By reason of its design, the replacement shopfront and security shutter is an unsympathetic and inappropriate addition to the property and wider parade, which would contribute towards the incremental loss of character of this part of the conservation area. The proposal would cause less than substantial harm to the character and appearance of the conservation area and there are no identified public benefits to outweigh this harm. The proposals fail to accord with the statutory duty, paras 199, 200 and 202 of the NPPF, local policies DMS1 and DMS2 and SPG Shopfronts.\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
