It is therefore considered that the proposed development would be contrary to policies DMH1 and DMTS13(c) of the Development Management Policies Document (2016).",
    "Reason : 2 - The application has failed to demonstrate that the proposal would include the provision of accessible rooms in accordance with British Standard BS8300-2:2018 Design of an accessible and inclusive built environment. Buildings. Code of practice. It is therefore considered that the proposed development would be contrary policy E10 of the London Plan (2021).\r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
