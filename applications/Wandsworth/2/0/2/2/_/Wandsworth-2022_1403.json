    "Reason : 1 - The proposal constitutes development under the Town and Country Planning Act 1990, and the local planning authority is not satisfied that, based on the drawings submitted as part of the application, this proposal falls within any class of 'permitted development' specified within Schedule 2 to the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposal would not be in accordance with A.1 (f) and (g) and A.2 (b). \r\nThe proposed development would result in a rearwards projection which would exceed the 3 metre maximum permitted for terraced dwellinghouses under permitted development contrary for A.1 (f). A prior notification application has not been submitted, in line with A.1 (g) and as the host property is located within the Oxford Road Conservation Area which is considered to be part of article 2(3) land, it's not possible for a lawful development application to exceed 3 metres in depth. \r\n\r\nAlso contrary to A.2 (b), the host site is on article 2(3) designated land and the extension would extend beyond the side elevation of part of the original dwellinghouse (outrigger). \r\n\r\nThe proposed extension would therefore not be in accordance with Class A of Part 1 of Schedule 2 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 as amended. \r\n"
