    "Reason : 1 - Provision A.4(7) of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended), requires that where any owner/occupier of any adjoining premises objects to a proposed development, the local planning authority must assess the amenity impacts of the proposed development on neighbouring properties. One objection has been received.  \r\n\r\nThe development would, by reason of its height and depth, result in an unacceptable loss of amenity to the neighbouring properties at no. 27 and 29 Kennet Close. The development would be overbearing, cause loss of outlook, and result in loss of light to the ground floor window of a habitable room in the adjoining properties. The proposal therefore fails to comply with policy DMS1 of the Development Management Policies Document (2016), and the Housing SPD (2016).\r\n\r\n"
