    "Reason : 1 - The development would by reason of its design cause harm to the Conservation Area. The shutters and housing do not create an acceptable degree of visual integration with the host property or the street scene and would result in less than substantial harm to the conservation area. Accordingly, the proposal does not conform with the objectives of DMPD (2016) policies DMS1, DMS2, DMTS9 and the Shopfronts SPG (1988).",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
