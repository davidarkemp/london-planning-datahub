The drawing does not accurately show the relationship of the extension with the neighbouring properties and the location of the first floor windows are not as existing. For a future planning application to be successful, there should be no discrepancies in plans or drawings. ",
    "Reason : 1 - Provision A.4(7) of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended), requires that where any owner/occupier of any adjoining premises objects to a proposed development, the local planning authority must assess the amenity impacts of the proposed development on neighbouring properties. One objection has been received. \r\n\r\nThe development would, by reason of its height and depth, result in an unacceptable loss of amenity to the neighbouring properties at no. 194 and 198 Southcroft Road. The development would be overbearing, cause loss of outlook, and result in loss of light to the ground floor window of a habitable room in the adjoining properties. The proposal therefore fails to comply with policy DMS1 of the Development Management Policies Document (2016), and Housing SPD (2016). \r\n\r\nINFORMATIVE: Please be advised that there are inaccuracies in drawing ref. A107 showing the proposed rear elevation. The drawing does not accurately show the relationship of the extension with the neighbouring properties and the location of the first floor windows are not as existing. For a future planning application to be successful, there should be no discrepancies in plans or drawings. \r\n"
