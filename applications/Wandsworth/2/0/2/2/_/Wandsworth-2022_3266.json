    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development, by virtue of the absence of any appropriate suitable access, would fail to provide safe and dignified independent access for all users without additional undue effort, separation or special treatment and therefore would fail to comply with policies DMS1(i) of the Development Management Policies Document (2016), policy LP1(12) of the Publication Version Local Plan (2022) and London Plan (2021) Policy D5.",
    "Reason : 2 - The Local Planning Authority is not satisfied that the proposed subterranean development would mitigate against the risk of internal flooding or otherwise exacerbate the flood risk on the site or beyond and therefore the proposal would fail to comply with policies DMS5 of the Development Management Policies Document (2016) and policy LP6 of the Publication Version Local Plan (2022)",
    "Reason : 3 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the reason for refusal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
