    "Reason : 1 - The proposal, due to its bulk, form and height, would be an unneighbourly overdevelopment of the site, failing to contribute positively to local spatial character or ensure a high level of physical integration with its surroundings, and resulting in a loss of amenity to neighbouring occupiers through a loss of light, outlook and an increased sense of enclosure, contrary to policies IS3 of the Core Strategy (March 2016); policy DMS1 of the Development Management Policies Document (March 2016) and policies LP1 and LP2 of the Wandsworth Emerging Local Plan. ",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably. In addition further guidance was offered to the applicant by the case officer during the processing of the application to identify amendments to address those elements of the scheme considered unacceptable. However, the necessary amendments to make the application acceptable are substantial and would materially change the development proposal. They would require further consultations to be undertaken prior to determination, which could not take place within the statutory determination period specified by the Department of Communities and Local Government. You are therefore encouraged to consider submission of a fresh application incorporating the material amendments set out below which are necessary to make the scheme acceptable. \r\n\r\nRequired amendments:\r\nReduce extent of three-storey rear addition and step the development down at the end. \r\n"
