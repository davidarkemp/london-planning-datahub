    "Reason : 1 - The proposed extensions by reason of their size, location and design \r\nwould result in unsympathetic and incongruous additions to the host dwelling. The roof extension and terrace would also result in a detrimental impact upon the amenity of neighbouring properties in terms of loss of privacy and overlooking. The proposed extensions would cause less than substantial harm to the Putney Embankment Conservation Area without public benefits to outweigh the identified harm. The proposals would therefore fail to accord with the statutory duty of the 1990 Act, paragraphs 190, 200 and 202 of the NPPF (2021), policies IS3 of Core Strategy (2016) and policies DMS1, DMS2 and DMH 5 of the DMPD (2016) in addition to the guidance set out within the Housing SPD (2016) and the Putney Embankment Conservation Area Appraisal and Management Strategy. ",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably. In addition further guidance was offered to the applicant by the case officer during the processing of the application to identify amendments to address those elements of the scheme considered unacceptable. However, the necessary amendments to make the application acceptable are substantial and would materially change the development proposal. They would require further consultations to be undertaken prior to determination, which could not take place within the statutory determination period specified by the Department of Communities and Local Government. You are therefore encouraged to consider submission of a fresh application incorporating the material amendments set out below which are necessary to make the scheme acceptable. \r\n\r\nRequired amendments:\r\n-Reduce size of roof extension, review materials \r\n-Amend design of side extension \r\n-Remove terrace\r\n"
