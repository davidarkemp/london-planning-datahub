    "Reason : 1 - The proposed two- storey extension, by reason of its scale and design would constitute an unsympathetic and incongruous form of development that would relate poorly to the host property, the neighbouring properties and would fail to preserve or enhance the character and appearance of the locally listed buildings and the Westbridge Road Conservation Area. Accordingly, it is considered that the proposal doesn't comply with paragraph 203 of the NPPF, DMS2, DMH5 of the Wandsworth DMPD (2016) and policies LP1, LP3 and LP5 within the PLVP (2023).\r\n\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
