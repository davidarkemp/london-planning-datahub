    "Reason : 1 - Insufficient evidence supplied to support the proposed tree works. As per the official guidance, all of the following information must be supplied:\r\nA description of the property, including a description of the damage and the crack pattern, the date that the damage first occurred/was noted, details of any previous underpinning or building work, the geological strata for the site identified from the geological map\r\nDetails of vegetation in the vicinity and its management since discovery of the damage. Include a plan showing the vegetation and affected building\r\nMeasurement of the extent and distribution of vertical movement using level monitoring. Where level monitoring is not possible, state why and provide crack monitoring data. Data provided must be sufficient to show a pattern of movement consistent with the presence of the implicated tree(s) \r\nA profile of a trial/bore hole dug to identify foundation type and depth and soil characteristics \r\nThe sub-soil characteristics including soil type (particularly that on which the foundations rest), liquid limit, plastic limit and plasticity index \r\nThe location and identification of roots found. Where identification is inconclusive, DNA testing should be carried out \r\nProposals and estimated costs of options to repair the damage \r\nA report from an arboriculturist to support the tree work proposals, including arboricultural options for avoidance or remediation of indirect tree related damage\r\n"
