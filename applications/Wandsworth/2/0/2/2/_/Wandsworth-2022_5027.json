    "Reason : 1 - The proposed extensions, due to their scale, bulk, siting and design, would result in an inappropriate and unneighbourly overdevelopment, with the additions failing to integrate with, and unduly dominating, the host property, detrimental to its character and appearance and contrary to adopted policy, in particular policies LP1, LP2 and LP5 of the Local Plan (adopted July 2023) and the objectives of the 'Housing' SPD (adopted November 2016).)",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan as well as offering a full pre application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably. However, the necessary amendments to make the application acceptable are substantial and would materially change the development proposal. They would require further consultations to be undertaken prior to determination, which could not take place within the statutory determination period specified by the Department of Communities and Local Government. You are therefore encouraged to consider submission of a fresh application incorporating the material amendments set out below which are necessary to make the scheme acceptable. \r\n\r\nRequired amendments:\r\nReduce the length of the proposed second floor extension and amend the design to reduce its bulk; omit the first floor extension.\r\n\r\n"
