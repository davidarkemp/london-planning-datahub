    "Reason : 1 - The development, due to the proposed mix of uses and the location of the site within the designated Thornsett Road Locally Significant Industrial Area, would be detrimental to the overriding objective to protect land and premises for industrial use and to retain a strategic reservoir of industrial land within the borough, contrary to policy LP34 of the Wandsworth Local Plan (adopted July 2023).",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan dated March 2016 consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document and in the adopted Local Plan dated July 2023, as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
