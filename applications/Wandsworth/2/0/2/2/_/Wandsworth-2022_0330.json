    "Reason : 1 - The proposal constitutes development under the Town and Country Planning Act 1990, and the local planning authority, pursuant to condition 8 of permission 84/W/3591 which removes permitted development rights for extensions, would require an application for planning permission for the development. In addition, the local planning authority is not satisfied that, based on the drawings submitted as part of the application, this proposal falls within any class of 'permitted development' specified within Schedule 2 to the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).\r\nINFORMATIVE: The proposed development fails to comply with paragraphs A.1(j) and (ja) of Class A of Part 1, Schedule 2 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended) as the enlarged part of the dwellinghouse, when considered with other enlargements would extend beyond a wall forming a side elevation of the original dwellinghouse and would have a width greater than half the width of the original dwellinghouse, and the total enlargement (being the enlarged part together with any existing enlargement of the original dwellinghouse to which it will be joined) exceeds or would exceed the limits set out in sub-paragraphs (h), (i) and (j).\r\n"
