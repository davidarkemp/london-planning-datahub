  "description": "TPO 10/1996 - T53 Cherry Laurel: The application is being made to remove the laurel tree in the front garden of 1-24 Albert Mansions. There is only one such tree in the garden and only one area of \"front\" garden for the above address, consequently no plan is being provided. As part of this work, we want to replace the tree with two smaller trees to compensate for the loss of the laurel. We are open to receiving your suggestions on the type of tree to be the replacement and would ideally like a few options from which to choose. Comments provided during a site visit by one of your officials some years ago, did suggest that the new trees should be allowed to establish themselves before the laurel could be removed, but we now consider that we would like to formally commence this process, obtain agreement to remove the tree and receive ideas of suitable replacements. In part answer to the next point on ownership of the tree, I am a director of Townready Property Management Ltd. and my address (15 Albert Mansions) has been entered in the address section earlier in this process. Townready owns 1-16 Albert Mansions and the leaseholders in those flats, own Townready; thus we have a share in the freehold of the building, with leases in excess of 900 years. I am entering the name and details of the managing agents for the block who attend to day-to-day issues in the next screen and they also handle the affairs of 17-24 Albert Mansions, although these flats are not owned by Townready. The directors of 17-24 Albert Mansions are in agreement with these works being carried out and will be given details of the replacement tree options to choose from along with ourselves.",
