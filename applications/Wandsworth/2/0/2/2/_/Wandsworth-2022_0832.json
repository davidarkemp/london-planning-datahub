    "Reason : 1 - The proposal constitutes development under the Town and Country Planning Act 1990, and the local planning authority is not satisfied that, based on the drawings submitted as part of the application, this proposal falls within any class of 'permitted development' specified within Schedule 2 to the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).\r\n\r\nIINFORMATIVE: The proposed development would fail to comply with the provisions of Schedule 2, Part 2, Class A of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended) by virtue of the height of the gate and fence exceeding 1 metre above ground level adjacent to a highway used by vehicular traffic. As the existing fence is to be entirely removed the replacement boundary would constitute a new boundary rather than one which would be 'maintained, improved or altered'. Therefore to extend the boundary up to it's former height requires planning permission.  "
