    "Condition : 1 - The development hereby permitted shall be begun within 3 years from the date of this permission.\r\nReason: To prevent the accumulation of unimplemented planning permissions and to comply with Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended) and to meet the requirements of Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004 and to meet the requirements of The Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015.\r\n",
    "Condition : 2 - The development shall be carried out in accordance with the reports, specifications and drawings detailed [FPA|0|225 02 rev B, FPA|0|225 04 rev B, Fire Safety Strategy (Email Correspondence sent 15 December 2022 15:04, Subject: Re: 61 Childebert Road SW17 8EY - 2022/4995)]. \r\nReason: To ensure a satisfactory standard of development and to allow the local planning authority to review any potential changes to the scheme. \r\n",
    "Condition : 3 - All brickwork used in the construction of the development hereby approved shall match the type, texture, tone, colour, size and profile of those used on the existing building and shall be retained permanently. \r\nReason: In the interest of the appearance of the development and to safeguard visual amenity, in accordance with Council policy DMS1 of the Development Management Policies Document (adopted March 2016) coupled with the requirements of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021.\r\n",
    "Condition : 4 - The outbuilding shall be used only in conjunction with and ancillary to the main use of the dwellinghouse. \r\nReason: To prevent the introduction of an independent use without prior consent by the local planning authority.\r\n",
    "Condition : 5 - INFORMATIVE: In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework 2021 to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application.  The Council has made available detailed advice in the form of its statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning Documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre-application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably. In addition, where appropriate, further guidance was offered to the applicant during the processing of the application.  ",
    "Reason : 1 - \r\nBy reason of its scale, siting and design, the proposal would cause an unneighbourly form of development due to an increased sense of enclosure and overbearingness.\r\nThe proposal therefore fails to comply with policies DMS1 and DMH5 of of the Development Management Policies Document (2016), policies LP1, LP2 and LP5 of the Wandsworth Publication Version Local Plan (Regulation 19 version) (2022) and the guidance within the Wandsworth Housing SPD (2016).\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably. In addition further guidance was offered to the applicant by the case officer during the processing of the application to identify amendments to address those elements of the scheme considered unacceptable. However, the necessary amendments to make the application acceptable are substantial and would materially change the development proposal. They would require further consultations to be undertaken prior to determination, which could not take place within the statutory determination period specified by the Department of Communities and Local Government.\r\n"
