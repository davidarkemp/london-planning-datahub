  "description": "1 x Mimosa Tree, 2 x Red Horse Chestnut Trees, 2 x White Horse Chestnut Trees, 4 x Lime Trees, 1 x Holm Oak, ! x Silver Birth Tree and 1 x Ash Tree. I would be looking to make a 15% crown reduction to the trees whilst keeping the original shaping and trimming them for overall health. The Horse Chestnut and Lime Trees are positioned along the property boundary and are currently overhanging the public pavement walkway, so i am looking to trim them back to clear the public pavement area. The Holm Oak, Ash and Silver Birch Trees are currently overhanging my neighbours roof anf I am looking to cut these back to avoid damage to their guttering or roof in the future. The Mimosa tree is just in need of a small trim. Ideally I would like to carry out the works as soon as possible before the trees come into full leaf to avoid damaging the trees growth period this Summer. A couple of the trees are coming into bud now so it would be good to do them within the next eight weeks or so.",
