    "Reason : 1 - The proposed works, by reason of their location, siting and design would result in a front curtilage that is dominated by parking and the removal of the front boundary treatment, detrimental to the visual amenity of the property and streetscene and would harm the character and appearance of the dwellinghouse, streetscene resulting in less than substantial harm to the Wandsworth Common Conservation Area without public benefits to outweight this harm contrary to the NPPF (2019), Policy IS3 of Council's Core Strategy (2016), Policies DMS2 and DMH5 of the Development Management Policies Document (2016), emerging policy LP3 and the Council's Housing SPD (2016)",
    "Reason : 2 - Due to the proximity of the junction with Henderson Road, the proposal would fail to have good visibility of pedestrians and traffic in both directions resulting in an unacceptable impact upon highway safety contrary to London Plan policy T4, DMT 1 and the Council's Housing SPD (2016). ",
    "Reason : 3 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
