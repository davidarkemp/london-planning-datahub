  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed side extension, by reason of its siting, design and scale, would constitute an unsympathetic and incongruous form of development in a prominent location.  It would relate poorly to, and cause harm to the neighbouring property and fail to preserve local spatial character.  The proposed development would conflict with policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021), policy PL1 of the Wandsworth Core Strategy (2016), policies DMS1 and DMH5 of the Wandsworth Development Management Policies Document 2016, policies LP1 and LP5 of the Wandsworth Publication Version Local Plan (Regulation 19 Version) (2022) and the guidance within the Wandsworth Housing Supplementary Planning Document (2016).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposal, by reason of its siting, design and scale, would be of an unneighbourly and overbearing form, causing harm to neighbouring amenities through an increased sense of enclosure, loss of outlook and daylight/sunlight.  The proposed development would conflict with policy DMS1 of the Wandsworth Development Management Policies Document 2016, policy LP2 of the Wandsworth Publication Version Local Plan (Regulation 19 Version) (2022) and the guidance within the Wandsworth Housing Supplementary Planning Document (2016).",
    "Reason : 3 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably. In addition further guidance was offered to the applicant by the case officer during the processing of the application to identify amendments to address those elements of the scheme considered unacceptable. However, the necessary amendments to make the application acceptable are substantial and would materially change the development proposal. They would require further consultations to be undertaken prior to determination, which could not take place within the statutory determination period specified by the Department of Communities and Local Government. \r\n"
