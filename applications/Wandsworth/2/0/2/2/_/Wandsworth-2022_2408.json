  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - By reason of the scale, design and appearance, the proposed development would appear as a visually intrusive and unsympathetic addition to the host building and streetscene and thus would cause a level of harm to the character and appearance of the Wandsworth Common Conservation Area with no public benefit to offset this. As such, the proposal would be contrary to Section 72(1) of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act (1990), the NPPF (2021), Policies DMS1, DMS2 and DMH5 of the DMPD (2016), policies LP1, LP3 and LP7 of the PVLP (2022) and the Housing SPD (2016).\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - By reason of its size and inadequate screening the proposed roof terrace would result in an unacceptable level of overlooking to neighbouring properties to the detriment of their amenities. As such, the proposal is considered contrary to policy DMS1 of the DMPD (2016), LP2 of the PVLP (2022) and the Housing SPD (2016). \r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
