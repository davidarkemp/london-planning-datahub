    "Reason : 1 - The proposed porch, by reason of its scale, design and location would result in an unsympathetic,  incongruous and visually prominent extension that would harm the character and the appearance of the host dwelling and the streetscene to which it forms part of. The application therefore fails to comply with Policies DMS1 and DMH5 of the Wandsworth Development Management Policies Document (2016), Policy LP1 and LP5 of The Wandsworth Publication Version Local Plan and the Housing SPD (2016).",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
