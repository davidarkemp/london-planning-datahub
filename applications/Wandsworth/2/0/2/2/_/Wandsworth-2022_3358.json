    "Reason : 1 - The proposal by reason of its siting, massing, bulk and design would result in a dominant, overwhelming and visually obtrusive addition that would relate poorly to the scale and architectural integrity of the host building and appear incongruous within the terrace it forms part of.  The proposal would therefore fail to preserve the character and appearance of the conservation area, with no public benefit to offset this harm. The proposal fails to comply with policies DMS1, DMS2 and DMH5 of the Development Management Policies Document (2016), the Housing SPD (2016) and The Totterdown Fields Conservation Area Appraisal & Management Strategy,  together with Section 72 (1) of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990. It would also fail to meet emerging policies LP1, LP3 and LP5 of the PVLP (2022).\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably. In addition further guidance was offered to the applicant by the case officer during the processing of the application to identify amendments to address those elements of the scheme considered unacceptable.
