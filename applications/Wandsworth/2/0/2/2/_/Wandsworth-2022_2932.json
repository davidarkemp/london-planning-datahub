    "Reason : 1 - The proposed telecommunications mast and associated equipment would by reason of its siting and appearance be of an incongruous and visually intrusive scale and design, resulting in undue and excessive clutter in the open street scene, harming the spatial character of the location, the visual amenities of neighbouring residents and the setting of the locally listed public House (the Avalon). The proposal would not meet with the relevant conditions attached to the Class A of Part 16 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order and would be contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policies HC1 and SI6 of the London Plan (2021), policy IS3 of the Wandsworth Core Strategy (2016), policies DMS1, DMS2 and DMS9 of the Wandsworth Development Management Policies Document (2016) and policies LP1, LP2 and LP3 of the Wandsworth Publication Version Local Plan (Regulation 19 Version) (2022).\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - By reason of its scale and siting, the proposed 15m mast and associated equipment cabinets, would create an unnecessary obstruction of the highway and adjoining public space, which would hinder convenient and safe public passage given the demands placed on it in this location. The proposal would not meet with the conditions attached to the relevant Class and would be contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), policies T1, T2 and T4 of the London Plan (2021), policy IS3 of the Wandsworth Core Strategy (2016), policies DMS1, DMS9 and DMT1 of the Wandsworth Development Management Policies Document (2016), policies LP1, LP2, LP22, LP49 and LP50 of the Wandsworth Publication Version Local Plan (Regulation 19 Version) (2022).and the guidance within the TfL's Streetscape Guidance Publication (2017).",
    "Reason : 3 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably. In addition further guidance was offered to the applicant by the case officer during the processing of the application to identify amendments to address those elements of the scheme considered unacceptable. However, the necessary amendments to make the application acceptable are substantial and would materially change the development proposal. They would require further consultations to be undertaken prior to determination, which could not take place within the statutory determination period specified by the Department of Communities and Local Government. \r\n"
