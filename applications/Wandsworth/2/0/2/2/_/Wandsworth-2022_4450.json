    "Reason : 1 - The proposal, by reason of its design, siting and proximity to neighbouring properties represents an unneighbourly form of development that would result in harm to the amenities of the neighbouring residential occupiers through actual and perceived overlooking and unacceptable levels of noise and disturbance. The proposal has not overcome the previous reason for refusal and would therefore be detrimental to neighbouring amenity, contrary to policy DMS1 of the Development Management Policies Document (2016) and policy LP2 of the PVLP (2022).",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
