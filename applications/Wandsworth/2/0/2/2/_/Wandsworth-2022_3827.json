    "Reason : 1 - The uPVC replacement doors and windows to the front and rear elevations, by reason of their design, detailing and materials, are unacceptable and inappropriate additions which cause undue harm to the character, appearance and heritage significance of the Oxford Road Conservation Area and are therefore be contrary to policies DMS1, DMS2 and DMH5 of the Local Plan (DMPD) (2016), policy HC1 of the London Plan (2021), the Local Plan SPD `Housing� (2016), Section 72(1) of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 and paragraph 199 of the NPPF (2021). ",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
