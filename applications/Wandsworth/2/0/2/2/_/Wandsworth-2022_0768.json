    "Reason : 1 - By reason of its scale, height and siting, the development constitutes an unsympathetic and incongruous form of development that overly dominates and competes with the original building. It relates poorly to the neighbouring properties and harms local spatial character. The development is contrary to policies PL1 and IS3 of the Wandsworth Core Strategy (2016), policies DMS1 and DMH5 of the Wandsworth Development Management Policies Document (2016), policies LP1 and LP5 of the Wandsworth Publication Version Local Plan (Regulation 19 Version) and the Wandsworth Housing SPD (2016). \r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - By reason of the design, size and level of occupancy, Flats 6, 10, 14 and 18 would fail to meet minimum floor space requirements for 1 bedroom 2 person flats and the residential units on the fourth floor (Flats 17 to 20) would not benefit from any dedicated private outdoor amenity space. The application has also failed to demonstrate suitable arrangements for the storage and management of waste and recycling for the flats. Accordingly, the development results in substandard residential accommodation for occupiers and is contrary to policies DMS1, DMH6 and DMH7 of the Wandsworth Development Management Policies Document (2016), policy LP2 of the Wandsworth Publication Version Local Plan (Regulation 19 Version), the Technical Housing Standards - Nationally Describe Space Standard and the Refuse and Recyclables in Developments SPD (2014).",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed mix of residential units would result in the excessive provision of single occupancy and one bedroom units thus failing to achieve a mixed and balanced community. The development is contrary to policy IS5 of the Wandsworth Core Strategy (2016), policy DMH3 of the Wandsworth Development Management Policies Document (2016) and policy LP24 of the Wandsworth Publication Version Local Plan (Regulation 19 Version).",
    "Reason : 4 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
