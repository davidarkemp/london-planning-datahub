    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development by reason of its prominent, incongruous and unsympathetic design, would result in harm to the appearance of the host building, the local spatial character and Clapham Junction Conservation Area. The proposal therefore fails to comply with policies Policy IS3 of the Core Strategy (2016), DMS1, DMS2, DMS8 and DMTS9 of the DMPD (2016), LP1, LP3 and LP9 of the Wandsworth Publication Version Local Plan (Regulation 19 Version) (2022), the NPPF (2021) and Section 66(1) and 72(1) of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990.",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the retrospective design of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal.\r"
