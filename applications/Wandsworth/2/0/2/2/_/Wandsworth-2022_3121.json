    "Reason : 1 - By reason of its scale, form and siting, the proposed development is considered to constitute an incongruous form of development which utilises a poor design and removes features which are considered to make a positive contribution to the conservation area. It is therefore considered that the proposed development would cause less than substantial harm to the character and appearance of the conservation area, with the public benefit of a contribution to the housing supply and improvements to existing shopfront not considered sufficient to outweigh the harm identified. The application therefore fails to meet the statutory duty of Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 and paragraphs 199, 200, and 202 of the NPPF as well as policies DMS1 and DMS 2(Development Management Policies Document) and IS 3 (Core Strategy).",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably. In addition further guidance was offered to the applicant by the case officer during the processing of the application to identify amendments to address those elements of the scheme considered unacceptable. However, the necessary amendments to make the application acceptable are substantial and would materially change the development proposal. They would require further consultations to be undertaken prior to determination, which could not take place within the statutory determination period specified by the Department of Communities and Local Government. You are therefore encouraged to consider submission of a fresh application incorporating the material amendments set out below which are necessary to make the scheme acceptable. \r\n\r\nRequired amendments:\r\n\r\nRetain existing front facade and set back upper floors from front facade as per approval ref: 2017/4246\r\n"
