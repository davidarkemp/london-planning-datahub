  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development by reason of over proliferation of 1-bed units and lack of family sized units, would fail to result in a unit mix suitable for the locality or support local policy objectives for mixed and balanced communities. The proposal therefore fails to comply with PL5 of the Wandsworth  Core Strategy (2016), policies DMS1 and DMH3 of the Wandsworth Development Management Policies Document (2016), policy LP24 of the Wandsworth Publication Version Local Plan (Regulation 19 Version) (2022).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed development by reason of its excessive scale, prominent, incongruous and unsympathetic design, would result in harm to the appearance of the host building and local spatial character. The proposal therefore fails to comply with policies DMS1 and DMH5 of the Wandsworth Development Management Policies Document (2016), policies LP1, LP2, LP5, LP6, and LP7 of the Wandsworth Publication Version Local Plan (Regulation 19 Version) (2022) and the guidance within the Housing SPD (2016).\r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed development, by reason of its overt scale and design, would result in an unneighbourly form of development to the harm of the amenities of neighbouring occupiers in terms of increased overshadowing, noise, disturbance, loss of privacy and appearing overbearing. The proposal therefore fails to comply with policy DMS1 of the Development Management Policies Document (2016), policy LP2 of the Wandsworth Publication Version Local Plan (Regulation 19 Version) (2022) and the guidance within the Housing SPD (2016).",
    "Reason : 4 - The proposed development by reason of layout and design would result in harm to the amenities of future occupiers by way of restricted outlook, privacy and natural light. The poor standard of accommodation is further apparent by the failure to provide adequate sizes and layout of dedicated external amenity space for the new units. The proposal therefore fails to comply with policy D6 of the London Plan (2021), policies DMS1, DMH4, DMH6 and DMH7 of the Wandsworth Development Management Policies Document (2016), policies LP2, LP7, LP27 of the Wandsworth Publication Version Local Plan (Regulation 19 Version) (2022) and the guidance within the Housing SPD (2016).\r\n",
    "Reason : 5 - The proposed development, by reason of a lack of identified suitable secure cycle parking and waste storage locations, would result in inadequate means of sustainable transport provision and adverse waste management on site. The proposal therefore fails to comply with policies DMS1 and DMT2 of the Development Management Policies Document (2016), policies LP1, LP2, LP13 and LP51 of the Wandsworth Publication Version Local Plan (Regulation 19 Version) (2022) and the guidance within the Refuse and recyclables in developments SPD (2014).",
    "Reason : 6 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably. In addition further guidance was offered to the applicant by the case officer during the processing of the application to identify amendments to address those elements of the scheme considered unacceptable. However, the necessary amendments to make the application acceptable are substantial and would materially change the development proposal. They would require further consultations to be undertaken prior to determination, which could not take place within the statutory determination period specified by the Department of Communities and Local Government. \r\n"
