    "Reason : 1 - 1. The scale, proportions and appearance of the proposed new shopfront and the external ventilation flue would detract from the individual character and appearance of the host property detrimental to its visual amenity and setting within the streetscene, contrary to policies DMS1 and DMTS of the Development Management Policies Document (adopted March 2016) and policies LP1 and LP8 of the emerging local plan. \r\n\r\n2. The proposed external ventilation flue would result in a loss of amenity to nearby residential occupiers through loss of outlook and increased noise and odours contrary to policy DMS1 of the Development Management Policies Document (adopted March 2016) and policy LP2 of the emerging local plan. \r\n\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
