  "description": "Alterations including excavation to enlarge basement with formation of front lightwell; erection of mansard roof extension to main rear roof with French doors and extension above two storey back addition; formation of roof terraces at rear of first and second floors with1.7m high side screens; erection of single storey rear/side extension in connection with use of property as 2 x 1-bedroom and 1 x -3-bedroom flats.",
  "decision_date": "03/01/2023",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The application site is located within Flood Risk Zone 2, and the submitted Flood Risk Assessment does not adequately identified the predicted finish floor levels and bedrooms at basement level are proposed, contrary to the provisions of policy DMS5 of the Councils adopted Development Management Policies Document (DMPD) (2016).",
    "Reason : 2 - The mansard roof extension above the two-storey rear addition would extend across more than 50% of the depth of roof and result in the total loss of the existing roof profile.  This would not accord with the Councils adopted Housing SPD (2016) or local spatial character, contrary to the provisions of policy DMS1 of the Councils adopted Development Management Policies Document (DMPD) (2016).",
    "Reason : 3 - The mansard roof extension above covering more than 50% of the depth of the roof above the back addition would result in occupiers of the adjoining 1C Atheldene Road experiencing an undue sense of enclosure, contrary to the provisions of policy DMS1c of the Councils adopted Development Management Policies Document (DMPD) (2016).",
    "Reason : 4 - Occupiers of the dwellings on the basement and ground floors would be afforded by very poor levels of outlook given the small separation distance from the ground floor rear doors from the flank wall of the 2-storey 1A Atheldene Road which adjoins to the east, contrary to the portions of policy DMH4 the Councils adopted Development Management Policies Document (DMPD) (2016) and the Mayors Housing SPD (2016).  ",
    "Reason : 5 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
