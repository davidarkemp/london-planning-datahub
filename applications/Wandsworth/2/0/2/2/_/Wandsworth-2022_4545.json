  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development, by reason of the scale, design and siting of the proposed extensions/alterations at roof level and the removal of the existing shopfront, would remove important character features, and the proposed new additions would fail to maintain a harmonious and subservient relationship to the host property. The proposed development would therefore cause 'less than substantial harm' to the application property, which is considered to make a positive contribution to the character and appearance of the conservation area. The public benefits of the scheme are not considered to be sufficient to outweigh this identified harm, and the proposal would therefore be contrary to Local Plan (2023) Policy LP3, paragraph 215 of the NPPF (2024) and Section 72 (1) of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990.",
    "Reason : 2 - By reason of the poor outlook afforded to one of the proposed residential units and the lack of private outdoor amenity space provided for the residential units, the development would provide an unacceptable standard of accommodation in significant detriment to the living conditions of future occupants, contrary to Local Plan (2023) Policy LP27.",
    "Reason : 3 - By reason of the scale, form, siting and fenestration arrangement of the proposed extensions to the rear of the property, the proposed development would have an unacceptable impact on the amenity of neighbouring residents by virtue of having an overbearing impact, increasing perceived overlooking and loss of daylight/sunlight, contrary to Local Plan (2023) Policy LP2.",
    "Reason : 4 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
