    "Reason : 1 - The proposed roof terrace, by reason of its scale, siting and design, constitutes an overbearing and unneighbourly form of development resulting in unacceptable loss of outlook, increased sense of enclosure and potential noise and disturbance from its use to neighbouring occupiers. Furthermore, the proposals have also failed to demonstrate that there would not be unacceptable harm to neighbouring windows in respect to reductions in daylight. The development would therefore be contrary to policy DMS1 of the Wandsworth Development Management Policies Document (2016), policy LP2 of the of the Wandsworth Publication Version Local Plan (Regulation 19 version) (2022) and Housing SPD (2016).",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
