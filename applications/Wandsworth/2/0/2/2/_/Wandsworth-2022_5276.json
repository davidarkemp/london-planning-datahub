    "Reason : 1 - The development by reason of its design, materials and siting would result in an incongruous addition harmful to the visual amenity of the street scene and local character. It would also be unduly harmful to the amenity of nearby occupiers resulting in an increased sense of enclosure and loss of outlook compared to the existing situation. The proposed amenity space would be substandard and the development would fail to provide adequate refuse storage. The proposal therefore fails to comply with the National Planning Policy Framework, policies DMS1, DMH6 of the DMPD (2016) and emerging policies LP1, LP2 and LP27 of the Local Plan and Refuse and Recyclables in Developments supplementary planning document (2014)",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
