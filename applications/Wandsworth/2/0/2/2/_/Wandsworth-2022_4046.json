  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposal by reason of its siting, scale, massing, bulk and design would result in an over-dominant and incongruous addition, which would relate poorly to the host and neighbouring properties. The proposal would result in less than substantial harm to the character and appearance of the host property, the Three Sisters Conservation Area whilst failing to provide any public benefit. The proposal would be contrary to policies PL1 and IS3 of the Core Strategy (2016), policies DMS1, DMS2 and DMH5 of the Development Management Policies Document (2016), policies LP1, LP3 and LP5 of the PVLP (2022), the guidance within the Housing Supplementary Planning Document (2016) and the Three Sisters Conservation Area Appraisal and Management Strategy (2008) as well as the NPPF (2021).",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
