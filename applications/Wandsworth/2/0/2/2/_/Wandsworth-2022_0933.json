    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development would result in the loss of existing green infrastructure, it is not considered that it has been demonstrated that exceptional circumstances exist that would justify this loss and no replacement provision will be +provided, contrary to Policy LP53 of the Local Plan. This would result in harm to visual amenity, loss of potential space for informal recreation and loss of potential ecological habitat. ",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposal would result in the loss of existing vegetation on the site, but no detail of ecological appraisals or assessments have been provided. The local planning authority therefore cannot be satisfied that the proposal would protect and enhance biodiversity, contrary to policy LP55 of the Local Plan. ",
    "Reason : 3 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
