    "Reason : 1 - The proposed illuminated advertisement would by reason of its height, size and prominent location would result in a visually intrusive and unsympathetic feature to the existing property and the streetscape to the detriment of the local visual amenity. Due to the location, scale and illumination, the proposed advertisement would be an obtrusive form of development that would result in harm to the amenity of neighbouring occupiers. The proposal would therefore be contrary to policies DMS1 and DMS8 of the Development Management Policies Document (2016), policies LP1, LP2 and LP9 of the PVLP (2023) and the NPPF (2021).",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
