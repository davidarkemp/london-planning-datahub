    "Reason : 1 - The proposal, by reason of its design, siting and proximity to neighbouring properties represents an unneighbourly form of development that would result in harm to the privacy of the neighbouring residential occupiers through actual and perceived overlooking. The proposal would therefore be detrimental to neighbouring amenity, contrary to policy DMS1 of the Development Management Policies Document (2016) and emerging policy LP2 of the Local Plan Publication (Regulation 19) version (2023).\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably. In addition further guidance was offered to the applicant by the case officer during the processing of the application to identify amendments to address those elements of the scheme considered unacceptable."
