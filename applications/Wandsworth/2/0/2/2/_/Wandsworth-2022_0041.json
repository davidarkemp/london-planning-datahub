  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development by reason of its siting, scale, and design would be harmful to the character and appearance of this property and to the  Wandsworth Common Conservation Area. It would result in a highly visible and unsympathtic form of development that relates poorly to the host property and surrounding area. The proposal therefore fails to comply with policies DMS1, DMS2 and DMH5 of the Development Management Policies Document, 2016 and the Housing SPD, 2016.\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably. In addition further guidance was offered to the applicant by the case officer during the processing of the application to identify amendments to address those elements of the scheme considered unacceptable. However, the necessary amendments to make the application acceptable are substantial and would materially change the development proposal. They would require further consultations to be undertaken prior to determination, which could not take place within the statutory determination period specified by the Department of Communities and Local Government. You are therefore encouraged to consider submission of a fresh application incorporating the material amendments set out below which are necessary to make the scheme acceptable. \r\n\r\nRequired amendments:\r\nDevelopment should comprise a modest enlargement to the existing access dormer only and omit a second rear dormer roof as currently proposed. The proposals should avoid the building up of the eaves and any terrace enlargement should remain as modest and discrete as possible. "
