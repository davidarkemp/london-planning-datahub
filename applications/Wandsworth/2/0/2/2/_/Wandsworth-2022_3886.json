    "Condition : 3 - Notwithstanding the provisions of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (or any Order revoking, amending or re-enacting that Order), no windows, doors or glazed areas (other than such as may be shown on the approved drawings shall be installed in the approved development.\nReason: To protect the privacy of neighbours and prevent overlooking, in accordance with Council policy DMS1 of the Development Management Policies Document (adopted March 2016) coupled with the requirements of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021.\n",
    "Condition : 4 - The outbuilding shall be used solely for purposes incidental to the occupation and enjoyment of the dwelling as such and not for any trade or business purposes or as a separate residential use.\nReason: This permission is granted exceptionally and only in view of the personal circumstances of the applicant.\n",
    "Condition : 5 - The roof area of the development hereby permitted shall not be used as a balcony, roof garden or similar amenity area and furthermore, no balustrades, railings or other means of enclosure or means of permanent access shall be erected on this area.\nReason: To control overlooking and safeguard the privacy of neighbours in accordance with Council policy DMS1 of the Development Management Policies Document (adopted March 2016) coupled with the requirements of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021.\n",
    "Condition : 6 - INFORMATIVE: In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework 2021 to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application.  The Council has made available detailed advice in the form of its statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning Documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre-application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably. In addition, where appropriate, further guidance was offered to the applicant during the processing of the application.  ",
    "Condition : 7 - Asset Protection Informatives for works in close proximity to Network Rail's infrastructure:\nThe developer must ensure that their proposal, both during construction and after completion does not:\n- encroach onto Network Rail land\n- affect the safety, operation or integrity of the company's railway and its infrastructure\n- undermine its support zone\n- damage the company's infrastructure\n- place additional load on cuttings\no adversely affect any railway land or structure\no over-sail or encroach upon the air-space of any Network Rail land\no cause to obstruct or interfere with any works or proposed works or Network Rail development both now and in the future\n\nNetwork Rail strongly recommends the developer complies with the following comments and requirements to maintain the safe operation of the railway and protect Network Rail's infrastructure.\n \nFuture maintenance \nThe applicant must ensure that any construction and subsequent maintenance can be carried out to any proposed buildings or structures without adversely affecting the safety of/or encroaching upon Network Rail's adjacent land and air-space. Therefore, any buildings are required to be situated at least 2 metres (3m for overhead lines and third rail) from Network Rail's boundary. \n\nThis requirement will allow for the construction and future maintenance of a building without the need to access the operational railway environment. Any less than 2m (3m for overhead lines and third rail) and there is a strong possibility that the applicant (and any future resident) will need to utilise Network Rail land and air-space to facilitate works as well as adversely impact upon Network Rail's maintenance teams' ability to maintain our boundary fencing and boundary treatments. Access to Network Rail's land may not always be granted and if granted may be subject to railway site safety requirements and special provisions with all associated railway costs charged to the applicant. \n\nAs mentioned above, any wo",
    "Condition : 8 - Scaffolding \nAny scaffold which is to be constructed within 10 metres of the railway boundary fence must be erected in such a manner that at no time will any poles over-sail the railway and protective netting around such scaffold must be installed. The applicant/applicant's contractor must consider if they can\nundertake the works and associated scaffold/access for working at height within the footprint of their property boundary.\n \nPiling \nWhere vibro-compaction/displacement piling plant is to be used in development, details of the use of such machinery and a method statement should be submitted for the approval of the Network Rail's Asset Protection Engineer prior to the commencement of works and the works shall only be carried out in accordance with the approved method statement.\n\nFencing \nIn view of the nature of the development, it is essential that the developer provide (at their own expense) and thereafter maintain a substantial, trespass proof fence along the development side of the existing boundary fence, to a minimum height of 1.8 metres. The 1.8m fencing should be adjacent to the railway boundary and the developer/applicant should make provision for its future maintenance and renewal without encroachment upon Network Rail land. Network Rail's existing fencing / wall must not be removed or damaged and at no point during or post construction should the foundations of the fencing or wall or any embankment therein, be damaged, undermined or compromised in any way. Any vegetation within Network Rail's land boundary must not be disturbed. Any fencing installed by the applicant must not prevent Network Rail from maintaining its own fencing/boundary treatment.\n\nLighting \nAny lighting associated with the development (including vehicle lights) must not interfere with the sighting of signalling apparatus and/or train drivers' vision on approaching trains. The location and colour of lights must not give rise to the potential for confusion with the signalli",
    "Condition : 9 - Landscaping \nAny trees/shrubs to be planted adjacent to the railway boundary these shrubs should be positioned at a minimum distance greater than their predicted mature height from the boundary.  Certain broad leaf deciduous species should not be planted adjacent to the railway boundary as the species will contribute to leaf fall which will have a detrimental effect on the safety and operation of the railway. Network Rail wish to be involved in the approval of any landscaping scheme adjacent to the railway. Any hedge planted adjacent to Network Rail's boundary fencing for screening purposes should be so placed that when fully grown it does not damage the fencing or provide a means of scaling it.  No hedge should prevent Network Rail from maintaining its boundary fencing. If required, Network Rail's Asset Protection team are able to provide more details on which trees/shrubs are permitted within close proximity to the railway.  \n\n Existing Rights \nWhilst not a planning matter, we would like to remind the applicant of the need to identify and comply with all existing rights on the land. Network Rail request all existing rights, covenants and easements are retained unless agreed otherwise with Network Rail. \n \nProperty Rights \nNotwithstanding the above, if any property rights are required from Network Rail in order to deliver the development, Network Rail's Property team will need to be contacted. \n\nIf you would like to discuss any of the above, please contact your local Network Rail's Asset Protection team:\n\nAnglia: AssetProtectionAnglia@Networkrail.co.uk \nKent and Sussex: AssetProtectionLondonSouthEast@NetworkRail.co.uk \nWessex: AssetProtectionWessex@NetworkRail.co.uk\n\nTo identify your route, please use the link: https://www.networkrail.co.uk/running-the-railway/our-routes"
