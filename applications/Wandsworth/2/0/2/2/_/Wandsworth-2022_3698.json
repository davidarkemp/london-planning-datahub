    "Condition : 1 - The development hereby permitted shall be begun within 3 years from the date of this permission.\r\nReason: To prevent the accumulation of unimplemented planning permissions and to comply with Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended) and to meet the requirements of Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004 and to meet the requirements of The Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015.\r\n",
    "Condition : 2 - All external materials used in the construction of the development hereby approved shall match the type, texture, tone, colour, size and profile of those used on the existing building and shall be retained permanently. \r\nReason: In the interest of the appearance of the development and to safeguard visual amenity of the conservation area, in accordance with Council policies DMS1 and DMS2 of the Development Management Policies Document (adopted March 2016) coupled with the requirements of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021.\r\n",
    "Condition : 3 - The development shall be carried out in accordance with the reports, specifications and drawings detailed [P/2000 Rev C; P/2001 Rev F; P/2002 Rev G; P/2003 Rev G; P/2100 Rev I; P/2101 Rev I; P/2200 Rev E; Daylight and Sunlight Assessment (prepared by EAL Consult, Rev I, dated July 2022); Fire Safety Statement]. \r\nReason: To ensure a satisfactory standard of development and to allow the local planning authority to review any potential changes to the scheme. \r\n",
    "Condition : 4 - Prior to occupation of the development the windows in the south [side elevation at first and second floor levels] of the development shall be obscure-glazed and non-opening (unless the parts of the window which can be opened are more than 1.7 metres above the floor of the room in which the window is installed).  The windows shall so be maintained and retained as such. \r\nReason: To control overlooking and safeguard the privacy of neighbours in accordance with Council policy DMS1(c) of the Development Management Policies Document (adopted March 2016) coupled with the requirements of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021.\r\n",
    "Condition : 5 - INFORMATIVE: In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework 2021 to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application.  The Council has made available detailed advice in the form of its statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning Documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre-application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably. In addition, where appropriate, further guidance was offered to the applicant during the processing of the application.  ",
    "Reason : 1 - By reason of the design, layout and location, the basement level studio flat  would provide substandard accommodation with an unacceptable level of outlook for future occupiers and the application has failed to demonstrate that an appropriate level of internal daylight would be achieved. The poor residential environment is further compounded by the failure to provide adequate private amenity space.  As such, the basement studio is contrary to policies DMS1, DMH4, DMH6 and DMH7 of the Development Management Policies Document 2016, together with emerging policies LP2 and LP27 of the Wandsworth Publication Version Local Plan (Regulation 19) (2022). ",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
