  "decision_conditions": [
    "Condition : 1 - The development hereby permitted shall be begun within 3 years from the date of this permission.\nReason: To prevent the accumulation of unimplemented planning permissions and to comply with Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended) and to meet the requirements of Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004 and to meet the requirements of The Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015.\n",
    "Condition : 2 - The development shall be carried out in accordance with the reports, specifications and drawings detailed [Location plan (received 29/03/2022); B76599-3000 Rev A; B76599-3100 Rev A; Fire Safety Report (dated March 2022)]. \nReason: To ensure a satisfactory standard of development and to allow the local planning authority to review any potential changes to the scheme. \n",
    "Condition : 3 - The roof area of the development hereby permitted shall not be used as a balcony, roof garden or similar amenity area and furthermore, no balustrades, railings or other means of enclosure or means of permanent access shall be erected on this area.\nReason: To control overlooking and safeguard the privacy of neighbours in accordance with Council policy DMS1 of the Development Management Policies Document (adopted March 2016) coupled with the requirements of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021.\n",
    "Condition : 4 - INFORMATIVE: In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework 2021 to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application.  The Council has made available detailed advice in the form of its statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning Documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre-application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably. In addition, where appropriate, further guidance was offered to the applicant during the processing of the application.  ",
    "Reason : 1 - By reason of design and layout the proposed development would provide an unacceptable sense of enclosure and poor level of outlook to two of the proposed bedrooms for future occupants. Furthermore, the application has failed to demonstrate that these bedrooms would achieve satisfactory levels of daylight and sunlight. Accordingly, the proposed development would be contrary to policy DMS1 of the Development Management Policies Document (2016), the Housing SPD (2016) and draft policy LP5 of the Publication Version Local Plan (2022).",
    "Reason : 2 - By reason of the proposed side facing bedroom windows fronting a shared accessway the proposed development would provide unacceptable levels of privacy for future occupants contrary to policy DMS1 of the Development Management Policies Document (2016), the Housing SPD (2016) and draft policy LP5 of the Publication Version Local Plan (2022).",
    "Reason : 3 - By reason of the proposed side facing bedroom windows fronting onto no.64 Fernlea Road the proposed development would constitute an unneighbourly form of development that would give rise to unacceptable levels of overlooking and loss of privacy to neighbouring windows contrary to policy DMS1 of the Development Management Policies Document (2016), the Housing SPD (2016) and draft policy LP5 of the Publication Version Local Plan (2022).",
    "Reason : 4 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably. In addition further guidance was offered to the applicant by the case officer during the processing of the application to identify amendments to address those elements of the scheme considered unacceptable. However, the necessary amendments to make the application acceptable are substantial and would materially change the development proposal. They would require further consultations to be undertaken prior to determination, which could not take place within the statutory determination period specified by the Department of Communities and Local Government. You are therefore encouraged to consider submission of a fresh application incorporating the material amendments set out below which are necessary to make the scheme acceptable. \n\nRequired amendments:\n************************************************************\n"
