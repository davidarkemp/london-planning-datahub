  "description": "Erection of a two-storey (with basement) 1-bedroom house, with formation of lightwell to front and with a green roof and roof terrace.\r\n",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposal, by reason of its location within an existing residential garden, would not be an appropriate form of development where national, regional and local planning policies makes presumption against such development due to the harm to the local spatial character that would occur, as in this case. Furthermore, by reason of their scale, form, siting and appearance the development would form a prominent and incongruous feature that would result in a harmful impact to local visual amenity and the character and appearance of the surrounding area, including the open rear garden setting of Cavendish Road and the adjoining streetscape. The proposed development would conflict with the NPPF (2021), policies H1 and D3 of the London Plan (2021), policies PL1 and IS3 of the Core Strategy (2016), policies DMS1 and DMH4 of the Development Management Policies Document (2016), and the Wandsworth Housing SPD (2016).\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - By reason of its scale and design, the proposed development would result in a substandard quality of accommodation with restricted outlook and natural light, causing harm to the amenities of future occupiers.\r\nThe proposal therefore fails to comply with policies D3 and D6 of the London Plan (2021), policies DMS1 and DMH4 of the Development Management Policies Document (2016), and the Wandsworth Housing SPD (2016).\r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - By reason of its siting, scale and design, the proposals would result in an unneighbourly form of development, causing harm to the amenities of neighbouring occupiers through loss of privacy, outlook and appearing overbearing. The applicant has also failed to demonstrate that the proposal would not result in a loss of daylight and overshadowing to neighbouring properties and rear gardens.\r\nThe proposal therefore fails to comply with policy D6 of the London Plan (2021), policies DMS1 and DMH4 of the Development Management Policies Document (2016), and the Wandsworth Housing SPD (2016).\r\n",
    "Reason : 4 - By reason of a lack of an appropriate Flood Risk Assessment, it has not been demonstrated that the proposal would not be at risk from flooding or result in increased risk of flooding in the surrounding area. The proposal is therefore contrary to policy DMS5 of the Development Management Policies Document (2016).\r\n",
    "Reason : 5 - The development by reason of its scale, design and siting on a substantial proportion of existing garden land, is considered to irreversibly alter existing ground conditions and would not provide appropriate replacment greening or  biodiversity  gain.  The proposal therefore fails to comply with policy D3 and G6 of the London Plan (2021), and policies DMS1 and DMO4 of the DMPD (2016).",
    "Reason : 6 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
