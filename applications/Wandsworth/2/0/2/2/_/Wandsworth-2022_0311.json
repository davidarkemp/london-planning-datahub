  "description": "Alterations including erection of hip to gable side roof extension and rear mansard roof extension (with French doors and safety railings) formation of roof terrace at third floor level with 1.7 m high railings.",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The roof extensions, by reason of their siting, scale and design, would constitute an unsympathetic, discordant and incongruous form of development that would result in harm to the character and appearance of the host property, the terrace it forms part of, the Battersea Park Conservation Area, and the setting of the locally listed building adjacent. The development would therefore fail to accord with Section 72 (1) of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990, paragraphs 199 and 202 of the NPPF (2021), Policy HC1 (C) of the London Plan (2021), policies DMS1, DMS2 and DMH5 of the Development Management Policies Document (2016), the Housing SPD (2016) and the Battersea Park Consevation Area Appraisal and Management Strategy. \r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
