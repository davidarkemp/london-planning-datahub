  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed hot food takeaway (sui generis) would be located within 400m of a school and would add to the existing overconcentration of hot food takeaways in the defined area. The proposal would therefore be contrary to the principles, including the healthy eating initiatives, identified within the NPPF (2021) (paragraphs 92c and 124e), policy E9(D) of the London Plan (2021), policies DMS1 and DMTS1 of the Development Management Policy Document (2016), policy LP15(B) of the Publication Version Local Plan (Regulation 19 Version) (2022) and the Town Centre Uses Supplementary Planning Document (March 2015). ",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed extract flue, by reason of its position, size and the stated sound output of the fan, would result in noise disturbance to residential property to the detriment of the amenities afforded to occupants. Furthermore, the extract flue would be an unneighbourly form of development that would result in loss of outlook and increased sense of enclosure to the residential window it adjoins. As such, the proposal would be contrary to Policy DMS1 (c) of the Wandsworth Borough Council Development Management Policies Document 2016 and emerging policy LP2 (b) of the Publication Version Local Plan (Regulation 19 Version) (2022).",
    "Reason : 3 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
