It can also mean that any exemptions or reliefs are lost.\nGeneral information on the Community Infrastructure Levy, including the forms mentioned above can be found on the Planning Portal (www.planningportal.gov.uk). Details of the Mayoral CIL can be found on the GLA and TfL websites (www.london.gov.uk and www.tfl.gov.uk).

    "Condition : 7 - INFORMATIVE: Any assessment of CIL liability by the Council has been based on the information provided. The assessment of CIL liability referred to in this informative is indicative only and is not intended to provide a binding estimate of the actual CIL liability likely to be incurred.  The assessment of the actual CIL liability will be provided pursuant to and in accordance with the Community Infrastructure Levy Regulations 2010 (as amended).  Where the calculation of CIL liability includes taking account of the existing use of a building, CIL liability may change if the information provided in relation to the existing use(s) of buildings, is not still current at the time of the decision which first permits development."
