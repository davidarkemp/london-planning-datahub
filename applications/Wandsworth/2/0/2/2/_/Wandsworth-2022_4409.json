  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposal constitutes development under the Town and Country Planning Act 1990, and the local planning authority is not satisfied that, based on the drawings submitted as part of the application, this proposal falls within any class of 'permitted development' specified within Schedule 2 to the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).\r\n\r\nINFORMATIVE: the proposed development would fail to comply with Schedule 2, Part 1, Class A, A.3 (a) of the Order. This is because the proposed window at first-floor level uses materials that are not of a similar appearance to the windows used in the construction of the exterior of the existing dwellinghouse. \r\n\r\nFurthermore, the proposed development would fail to comply with Schedule 2, Part 1, Class B, B.1 (b) of the Order. This is because the ridge would be raised to protrude past the existing ridge which would in turn exceed the height of the highest part of the existing roof. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, the proposed development would fail to comply with Schedule 2, Part 1 Class B, B.2 (a) of the Order. This is because the proposed windows on the rear elevation of the dormer would use materials that are not of a similar appearance to the windows used in the construction of the exterior of the existing dwellinghouse.
