    "Reason : 1 - The proposed roof terrace, by reason of its scale, appearance and location would provide an incongruous and discordant addition to the property which would result in harm to the character and appearance of the host building, the local spatial character and Park Town Estate Conservation Area. The terrace would also be an unneighbourly form of development resulting in an unacceptable impact on neighbouring residential amenity through harmful overlooking. The proposal therefore fails to comply with policies Policy IS3 of the Core Strategy (2016), DMS1, DMS2 and DMH5 of the DMPD (2016), LP1, LP2, LP3 and LP5 of the Local Plan Publication (Regulation 19) version with modifications (PVLP) (2023), the NPPF (2021) and the Housing SPD (2016).",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the design of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
