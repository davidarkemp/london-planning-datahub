    "Reason : 1 - The proposed first floor rear terrace, due to its siting, design and location at first floor level, would be a prominent, visually intrusive, discordant and unneighbourly feature that would fail to relate appropriately to the host building and local spatial character. The development would therefore be contrary to policies PL1 and IS3 of the Core Strategy (2016), policies DMS1 and DMH5 of the Wandsworth Development Management Policies Document (2016), policies LP1 and LP5 of the Wandsworth Publication Version Local Plan (Regulation 19 version) (2022) and the Wandsworth Housing SPD (2016).",
    "Reason : 2 - By reason if its scale, siting and design, the proposed development would result in a sense of overbearing, perceived increased sense of overlooking and loss of privacy, noise and disturbance, harming the amenities of existing neighbouring occupiers. The development would therefore be contrary to policy DMS1 of the Wandsworth Development Management Policies Document (2016), policy LP2 of the of the Wandsworth Publication Version Local Plan (Regulation 19 version) (2022) and Housing SPD (2016).",
    "Reason : 3 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
