    "Reason : 1 - The proposals would result in the loss of office floorsapce within Wandsworth Town Centre and insufficient evidence has been submitted to demonstrate that there is no demand for this floorspace to be retained and no evidence has been submitted that the unit has been marketed for community, cultural or other employment-genera rating uses, contrary to the provisions of policies EI3 and EI7 of the Councils adopted Local Plan Employment and Industry Document (LPEID) (2018) and policy LP33 of the Councils emerging Local Plan.  ",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed ground floor studio dwelling would provide sub-standard accommodation by reason of the dwelling being afforded with poor levels of outlook and it has not been demonstrated that the dwelling would benefit from good levels of daylight penetration in accordance with Building Research Establishment (BRE) guidance BRE209 2022, contrary to the provisions of policy DMH4 of the Councils adopted Development Management Policies Document (DMPD) (2016) and policy LP27 of the Councils emerging Local Plan and the Mayors adopted Housing SPG (2016).",
    "Reason : 3 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
