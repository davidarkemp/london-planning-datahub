    "Reason : 1 - The replacement windows from timber to uPVC and the alterations to the front doorway, by reason of their design and proportions, would have a detrimental impact upon the appearance of the property and would not preserve the character and appearance of the Park Town Estate Conservation Area. It is considered that the proposal would have an unacceptable impact on the host building, and the wider area. The proposal therefore fails to comply with policies PL1 and IS3 of the Core Strategy (2016), policies DMS1, DMS2 and DMH5 of the Development Management Policies Document (2016), policies LP1, LP3 and LP5 of the Local Plan Publication (Regulation 19) Version January 2022, the Supplementary Planning Document: Housing (2016) and guidance within the Park Town CA Appraisal & Management Strategy.",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
