    "Reason : 1 - The proposed three-storey extension by reason of its scale, design and location would be an unduly overbearing and unneighbourly addition that would have a detrimental impact on the amenity of neighbouring properties in the form of loss outlook, privacy, being overbearing and creating an increased sense of enclosure. Furthermore, the proposals have also failed to demonstrate that there would not be unacceptable harm to the neighbouring second floor window in respect to reductions in daylight and sunlight. \r\nAccordingly, the proposal would be contrary to the objectives of policies DMS1 of the DMPD (2016) as well as the guidance of the Housing SPD (2016) emerging policy LP2 of the PVLP.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed three-storey extension by reason of its scale, design and location would constitute an incongruous feature, harmful to the character and appearance of this property and to the visual amenities of the surrounding area. The design and scale is such that it would overwhelm the property and disrupt the continuity of the terrace it forms part of. \r\nAccordingly, the proposal would be contrary to the objectives of policies DMS1 and DMH5 of the DMPD (2016) as well as the guidance of the Housing SPD (2016) emerging policies LP1 and LP5 of the PVLP.\r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
