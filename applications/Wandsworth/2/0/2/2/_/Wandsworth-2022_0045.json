  "description": "Installation of external access stair and associated first floor external door (retrospective) to first floor flat 20 Netherfield Road and addition of 1.8m high privacy screen to landing and stair to rear elevation. Alterations to ground floor flat layout at 18 Netherfield Road to maintain privacy to include replacement of window and door, installation of obscured glazing to two rear windows and installation of new dividing fence.",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposal  by reason of its scale, design and siting would result in an incongruous and visually intrusive addition, harming the character and appearance of the property and local area. It would therefore be contrary to policies DMS1 and DMH5 of the Development Management Policies Document (2016), and the guidance contained in the Wandsworth Housing SPD (2016).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposal, by reason of its design, siting and proximity to neighbouring properties represents an unneighbourly form of development that would be visually overbearing and result in harm to the amenities of the neighbouring residential occupiers through unacceptable levels of noise and disturbance. The proposal would therefore be detrimental to neighbouring amenity, contrary to policy DMS1 of the Development Management Policies Document (2016).",
    "Reason : 3 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
