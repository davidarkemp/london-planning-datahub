    "Reason : 1 - The proposal is inappropriate development on Metropolitan Open Land (MOL) due to the harm identified to the openness of MOL. Other harm has been identified to the character and appearance of the conservation area by virtue of the inappropriate cladding material and boundary treatment. A case for Very Special Circumstances (VSC) has been advanced by the applicant and it is considered that this case for VSC does not outweigh the harm identified. The proposal is therefore contrary to Core Strategy policy PL4, DMPD policy DMO1, London Plan policy G3 and NPPF, in particular paragraphs 147 and 149. ",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed development by reason of the proposed inapropriate materials,  would appear visually intrusive and harm the setting of the locally listed Resevoir Cottage. The proposal would therefore cause less than substantial harm to the significance of the heritage asset. It is not considered that the public benefits outlined  would be sufficient to outweigh the harm to the heritage asset. The proposal is therefore contrary to policies DMS1 and DMS2 of the DMPD, Policy HC1 of the London Plan and the NPPF. \r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
