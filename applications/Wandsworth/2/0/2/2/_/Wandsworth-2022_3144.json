    "Reason : 1 - The development by reason of its considerable cumulative depth, massing, design and materials would represent an unacceptable addition which would  fail to respect the character and appearance of the surrounding area, rear building line or wider conservation area. As such, the proposal would be contrary to policy DMS1, DMS2 and DMH5 of the DMPD (2016) and Para 199 of the NPPF (2021).",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
