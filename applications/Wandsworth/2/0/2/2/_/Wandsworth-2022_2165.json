    "Reason : 1 - By reason of their scale, design and siting it is considered that the proposed side and rear dormer roof additions would dominate the appearance of the front and rear elevations of the property, detracting from and in significant detriment to its character, and would be highly visible within the existing street scene. The side dormer is approx. the same size and the rear dormer is larger and of a more unsympathetic design to the proposal that was previously refused under application 2019/5257, and therefore has clearly not overcome the previous reasons for refusal. It is therefore considered that the proposed development would cause less than substantial harm to the character of the Sutherland Grove Conservation Area. There is no public benefit that would outweigh this harm. The development is therefore not consistent with DMPD policies DMS1, DMS2 and DMH5; Wandsworth SPDs (Housing (2015); nor the statutory duty of Section 72 (1) of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990, Policy HC1 (C) of the London Plan (2021) and paragraph 199 - 202 of the NPPF (2021).",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably. In addition further guidance was offered to the applicant by the case officer during the processing of the application to identify amendments to address those elements of the scheme considered unacceptable. However, the necessary amendments to make the application acceptable are substantial and would materially change the development proposal. They would require further consultations to be undertaken prior to determination, which could not take place within the statutory determination period specified by the Department of Communities and Local Government. You are therefore encouraged to consider submission of a fresh application incorporating the material amendments set out below which are necessary to make the scheme acceptable. \r\n\r\nRequired amendments:\r\n-Remove side dormer from proposal\r\n-Reduce scale of rear dormer and change materiality \r\n"
