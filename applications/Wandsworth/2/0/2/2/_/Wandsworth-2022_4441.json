  "decision_date": "22/12/2022",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - By reason of the scale, design and siting of the proposed extension, the development would substantially reduce the spatial gap between the application property and the adjacent no.5 Melrose Road which contributes towards the spacious character of the conservation area and would compete for dominance with the existing property. The proposed development would therefore cause less than substantial harm to the character and appearance of the conservation area, with no public benefit that would outweigh this harm, contrary to  Section 72(1) of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990, the NPPF, polices DMS1, DMS2 and DMH5 of the DMPD and policy HC1 of the London Plan.",
    "Reason : 2 - Due to insufficient detail being provided, the Council cannot be satisfied that adequate replacement planting would be provided to mitigate against the loss of two existing trees in the Conservation Area, nor can it be satisfied that the trees to be retained on the site would be suitably protected during construction works. It is therefore considered that the proposal would cause harm to and the loss of existing trees in the Conservation Area, without sufficient mitigation, causing harm to visual amenity and biodiversity interests, contrary to policies DMO4 and DMO5 of the DMPD. ",
    "Reason : 3 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
