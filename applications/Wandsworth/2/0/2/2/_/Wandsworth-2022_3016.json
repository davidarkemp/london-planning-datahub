    "Reason : 1 - The proposed telecommunications equipment would, by reason of its siting and appearance, be overly prominent, unsympathetic and of intrusive scale and design, resulting in a visually overbearing addition to the streetscape and excessive clutter, causing unacceptable harm to the setting of the adjacent Locally Listed building and causing less than substantial harm to the character and appearance of the Victoria Drive Conservation Area, whilst causing unacceptable harm to neighbour amenity. The proposal would not meet with the relevant conditions attached to Class A of Part 16 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order and would be contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policies SI6 of the London Plan (2021), policy IS3 of the Wandsworth Core Strategy (2016), policies DMS1, DMS2, DMS9 and DMO1 of the Wandsworth Development Management Policies Document (2016)."
