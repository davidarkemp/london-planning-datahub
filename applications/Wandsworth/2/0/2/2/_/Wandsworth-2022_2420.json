    "Condition : 2 - The development shall be carried out in accordance with the reports, specifications and drawings detailed [Ventilation statement; 9 PH: 01A; 02A; 03A; 04B; 05B; 06B; 07B; 08A; 09A; 10B; 14B and 17B]. \nReason: To ensure a satisfactory standard of development and to allow the local planning authority to review any potential changes to the scheme. \n",
    "Condition : 3 - Prior to commencement of above ground works details and samples of materials proposed to be used on all external surfaces of the development shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority. The development shall be carried out in accordance with the approved materials and thereafter so retained. The bricks should match the existing and we will need to see samples. The extension should be built in a matching bond using lime mortar and the pointing should be flush and rag-finished to give a traditional appearance. There should be no render used on any part of the extension, only matching brickwork.\nReason: In order to assess the suitability of the proposed materials, in the interests of the appearance of the locality, in accordance with Council policy DMS1 of the Development Management Policies Document (adopted March 2016) coupled with the requirements of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021.\n",
    "Condition : 4 - The roof area of the development hereby permitted shall not be used as a balcony, roof garden or similar amenity area and furthermore, no balustrades, railings or other means of enclosure or means of permanent access shall be erected on this area.\nReason: To control overlooking and safeguard the privacy of neighbours in accordance with Council policy DMS1 of the Development Management Policies Document (adopted March 2016) coupled with the requirements of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021.\n",
    "Condition : 5 - INFORMATIVE: In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework 2021 to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application.  The Council has made available detailed advice in the form of its statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning Documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre-application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably. In addition, where appropriate, further guidance was offered to the applicant during the processing of the application.  "
