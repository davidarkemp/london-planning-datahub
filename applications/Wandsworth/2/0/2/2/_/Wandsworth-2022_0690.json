    "Reason : 1 - By reason of its siting and appearance, the proposed telecommunications masts and associated equipment would be of an incongruous and visually intrusive scale and design, resulting in in harm to the appearance of the host building and adversely impacting the spatial character and setting of the locality. The proposal would therefore be contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policy SI6 of the London Plan (2021) and policies DMS1, DMS9 and DMH5 of the Wandsworth Development Management Policies Document (2016).",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably. In addition further guidance was offered to the applicant by the case officer during the processing of the application to identify amendments to address those elements of the scheme considered unacceptable. However, the necessary amendments to make the application acceptable are substantial and would materially change the development proposal. They would require further consultations to be undertaken prior to determination, which could not take place within the statutory determination period specified by the Department of Communities and Local Government.
