    "Reason : 1 - The development would by reason of its scale and siting cause unacceptable adverse effects on neighboursï¿½ amenity in the form of increased sense of enclosure, loss of daylight and sunlight, and being overbearing.\r\nThe proposal therefore fails to comply with policy DMS1 of the Development Management Policies Document (2016), and the Housing Supplementary Planning Document (2016).\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
