  "description": "Alterations including erection of two additional storeys over main roof and extension above part of three storey back addition with formation of 1x rear roof terrace and 1x rear balcony; four storey side/rear extension; replacement of windows to front and side elevations; replacement of shopfront with windows to side elevation, replacement of concrete panels with brickwork to front elevation. Part change of use from office (Class E) to residential (Class C3) in connection with internal reconfigurations to five existing flats (3 x 2 bedroom and 2 x 1 bedroom flats, changed to 4 x 1 bedroom and 1 x 2 bedroom flats) and provision of new 1 x 4 bedroom flat. \r\n",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The development, by reason of its scale, bulk, and design, would constitute an unsympathetic and incongruous form of development in a visually prominent location that would fail to integrate successfully with the host property. The proposed extension would relate poorly to, and cause harm to, the local spatial character of the location and fail to preserve the character and appearance of the Wandsworth Common Conservation Area. Furthermore, the proposal, at five storeys would constitute a mid-rise building located outside of a designated mid-rise zone. The development is therefore considered to fail to pay due regard to Section 72(1) of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990, and fails to comply with the NPPF (2021), the London Plan (2021), Wandsworth's Core Strategy (2016) policies PL1 and IS3, Wandsworth's DMPD (2016) policies DMS1, DMS2 and DMH5 and guidance within Wandsworth's Housing SPD (2016) and the Wandsworth Common Conservation Area Appraisal and Management Strategy. It would also fail to comply with emerging policies LP1, LP3, LP4 and LP5 of the PVLP (2022).\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposal would by reason of scale, design and location would constitute an unneighbourly form of development that would have a harmful impact on the amenity of the neighbouring occupiers at no. 165 Battersea Rise in the form of loss outlook, being overbearing and creating an increased sense of enclosure. The proposed extension would therefore be contrary Wandsworth's DMPD (2016) policy DMS1 (c) and guidance within Wandsworth's Housing SPD (2016), together with emerging policy LP2 (b) of the PVLP (2022).\r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposal would provide an inadequate waste storage facility to the proposed residential flats and would therefore be contrary to the objectives of Wandsworth's DMPD (2016) policy DMS1 and guidance within the Refuse and Recyclables in Development SPD (2014), together with emerging policy LP2 (e) of the PVLP (2022).\r\n",
    "Reason : 4 - Insufficient details have been provided in relation to the amount or design of the proposed cycle parking. As such the proposal would be contrary to the objectives of Wandsworth's DMPD (2016) policy DMT2 and emerging LP51 of the PVLP (2022).\r\n",
    "Reason : 5 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
