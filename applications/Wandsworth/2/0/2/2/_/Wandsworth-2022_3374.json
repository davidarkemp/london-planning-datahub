    "Reason : 1 - The proposal constitutes development under the Town and Country Planning Act 1990, and the local planning authority is not satisfied that, based on the drawings submitted as part of the application, this proposal falls within any class of 'permitted development' specified within Schedule 2 to the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).\r\n\r\nINFORMATIVE: The proposed development would not comply with the provisions of Schedule 2, Part 1, Class A.1 (b), (g), (j) and (ja), of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended). This is because the proposed development (as a total enlargement) would extend beyond the rear wall of the original dwellinghouse in the side return by 8.69m. Additionally, the submitted plans indicate that the proposed extension would exceed 50% of the total area of the curtilage (excluding the ground area of the original dwellinghouse). Lastly, the plans show that the enlarged part of the dwellinghouse would extend beyond a wall forming a side elevation of the original dwellinghouse and would have a width greater than half the width of the original dwellinghouse. \r\n\r\n"
