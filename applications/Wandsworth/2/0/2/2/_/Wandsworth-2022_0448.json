    "Reason : 1 - By reason of its scale and siting, the proposal would constitute an unsympathetic and prominent form of development that would relate poorly to neighbouring properties to the detriment of the spatial character of the location and appearance of the area. The development would fail to positively contribute to the character of the area and would be contrary to policy IS3 of the Core Strategy (2016) and policy DMS1 of the Development Management Policies Document (2016).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed development has failed to demonstrate that there would not be unacceptable harm to neighbouring windows in respect to reductions in daylight and sunlight. In addition, by reason of the location of the first floor window facing the rear of Kenlor Road properties, the development would result in harm to the privacy of the neighbouring residential occupiers through actual and perceived overlooking. The proposal would therefore be contrary to policy DMS1 of the Development Management Policies Document (2016) and the Housing SPD (2016).",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed development would provide a poor level of accommodation as the proposed residential dwelling would comprise substandard outdoor amenity space. The proposal would therefore be contrary to policy DMH7 of the Wandsworth Development Management Policies Document (2016).",
    "Reason : 4 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
