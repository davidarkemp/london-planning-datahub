    "Condition : 1 - Please be advised that the previous prior approval application submitted at the property did comply with the limits and conditions of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015. The previous application was refused on amenity grounds.  \r\n\r\n",
    "Reason : 1 - The proposal involves development under the Town and Country Planning Act 1990, but the Local Planning Authority is not satisfied that, based on the drawings submitted as part of the application, the proposal falls within any  class of 'permitted development' specified in Schedule 2 to the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 1995 (as amended).\r\n\r\nThe proposed development would fail comply with Class A of Schedule 2, Part 1 (g), (i), (ja) and (k) of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended). This is because the extension to the rear elevation (including raised decking) extends more than 6m, the height of the eaves of the extension is more than 3m and is located with 2m of the boundary of the curtilage, and the extension would feature a raised platform to the rear.  \r\n\r\nIn addition to the failure to comply with the Prior Approval legislation under Class A, the applicant is advised that the proposed development would also fail to comply with Class D of Schedule 2, Part 1 (b) and (c) of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended). This is because the porch would have a height of more than 3m and the ground area of the structure would exceed 3 square meters. "
