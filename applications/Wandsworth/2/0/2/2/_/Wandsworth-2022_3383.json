    "Reason : 1 - The development would by reason of the proposed scale, massing, deisgn and proportions, result in an overdevelopment at the rear of the host property, which would neither preserve nor enhance the character of the host site or wider area. The proposed works would not be subordinate additions to the rear with the design contextually harming the appearance of the property. The works would also reuslt in undue harm to the amenity of neighbouring occupiers in the form of loss of light, outlook increased sense of enclosure and being overbearing. \r\nThe proposal therefore fails to comply with policies NPPF, DMS1 and DMH5 of the Development Management Policies Document (2016), and Housing SPD.\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
