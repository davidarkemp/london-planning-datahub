  "description": "Location: The left rear corner of the driveway. The tree is a smoketree that is between 5 metres and 6 metres high, and has 3 trunks at 1.5m high with average diameters between 73mm and 80mm. The works will be the felling of the smoketree to ground level, and the grinding of the stump to 300mm below adjacent ground level. All resulting debris from the works will be removed the same day and disposed of appropiately. The works will be carried out by a professional tree surgeon based in Wandsworth, who I have already approached and obtained a quote from. Removal of the smoketree has been recommended by a chartered surveyor due to the long term risk of damage it poses to the gas meter. I have included the relevant page from the surveyors report with this application. The relevant subsection is F2, and it has been rated a 3 by the surveyor - a 3 rating is defined as \"an element has defects that are serious and/or need to be repaired, replaced, or investigated urgently. Failure to do so could risk serious safety issues or severe long-term damage to your property.\"",
