  "description": "TPO 150/1994 - T62 (Cherry Tree), the intention is to undertake a crown reduction of about 3.5 feet. You can see where a previous crown reduction was undertaken and we would like to restore it to this level. This is to improve the light to the flats on this side of the building, and to prevent damage as the tree is now pushing against the upper floor windows and to free up the building-shared satellite dish. (Pictures 1 - 3) T63 (London plane), the intention is to undertake a small crown reduction of about 1.5 foot. This is to improve light to the right hand side of the building. (Picture 4) Unidentified tree by left-hand side garden gate. The intention is to undertake a crown reduction of about 3 feet to improve the light to the left hand side of the building and improve access to said gate. (Picture 5) Measurements are estimated.",
