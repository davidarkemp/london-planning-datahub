  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development, by reason of the siting, scale, massing and form of the proposed ground floor extension, would be an inappropriate over-development, resulting in the provision of an unduly dominant addition that would relate poorly to the host property, detracting from its character and its setting within the streetscape, and failing to preserve or enhance the character. appearance and Heritage significance of the Wandsworth Common Conservation Area. The proposal would therefore be contrary to policies IS3 of the Core Strategy (March 2016); DMS1; DMS2 and DMH5 of the Development Management Policies Document (March 2016) and the Housing SPD (November 2016), coupled with the requirements of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021.\r\n\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably. In addition further guidance was offered to the applicant by the case officer during the processing of the application to identify amendments to address those elements of the scheme considered unacceptable. However, the necessary amendments to make the application acceptable are substantial and would materially change the development proposal. They would require further consultations to be undertaken prior to determination, which could not take place within the statutory determination period specified by the Department of Communities and Local Government. You are therefore encouraged to consider submission of a fresh application incorporating the material amendments set out below which are necessary to make the scheme acceptable. \r\n\r\nRequired amendments:\r\nOmit the projection of the proposed rear extension beyond the north elevation of the existing house.\r\n"
