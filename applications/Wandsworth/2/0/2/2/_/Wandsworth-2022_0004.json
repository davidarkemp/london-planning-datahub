  "description": "Erection of single-storey rear extension to ground floor flat and removal of front wall and provision of hardstanding in front garden.",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - By reason of its design, siting, size and scale the proposed development would be a prominent, unsympathetic and visually intrusive addition to the original building, streetscene and locality. It would fail to physically integrate with its surroundings and would detract from the local spatial character. The proposal therefore fails to comply with policies DMS1 and DMH5 of the Development Management Policies Document (2016) and the guidance of the Housing SPD (2016).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed extension by reason of its depth, height and siting would be an unduly dominating and unneighbourly addition, would constitute an unneighbourly form of development that would have a harmful impact on the amenity of the neighbouring occupiers at Nos.1 and 5 Upper Tooting Park Road in the form of loss outlook, being overbearing and creating an increased sense of enclosure. The proposal has also failed to demonstrate that there would not be unacceptable harm to neighbouring windows in respect to reductions in daylight. The proposed extension would therefore be contrary to policy DMS1 (c) of the Development Management Policies Document (2016) and the guidance of the Housing SPD (2016).",
    "Reason : 3 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably. In addition further guidance was offered to the applicant by the case officer during the processing of the application to identify amendments to address those elements of the scheme considered unacceptable. However, the necessary amendments to make the application acceptable are substantial and would materially change the development proposal. They would require further consultations to be undertaken prior to determination, which could not take place within the statutory determination period specified by the Department of Communities and Local Government. You are therefore encouraged to consider submission of a fresh application incorporating the material amendments set out below which are necessary to make the scheme acceptable. \r\n\r\nRequired amendments:\r\n- Reduce size of extension.\r\n\r\n"
