    "Reason : 1 - The proposal, by reason of its siting, design and scale, would represent a  visually intrusive and incongruous addition, thereby causing harm to the appearance of the host terrace and local spatial character. The proposed development would conflict with policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021), policies PL1 and  IS3 of the Wandsworth Core Strategy (2016), policies DMS1, DMH4 and DMH5 of the Development Management Policies Document 2016, policies LP1, LP5 and LP7 of the Wandsworth Publication Version Local Plan (Regulation 19 Version) (2022) and the guidance within the Wandsworth Housing Supplementary Planning Document (2016).",
    "Reason : 2 - The applicant has failed to demonstrate that the proposal would provide safe and accessible residential and commercial waste storage which would not prejudice the function of existing commercial uses on site or cause harm to the amenities of existing and future occupiers in terms of general amenity and hygiene on site.  The proposal therefore fails to comply with policy DMS1 of the Development Management Policies Document (2016), policies LP1 and LP13 of the Wandsworth Publication Version Local Plan (Regulation 19 Version) (2022) and the Wandsworth Refuse and recyclables in developments Supplementary Planning Document (2015).",
    "Reason : 3 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably. In addition further guidance was offered to the applicant by the case officer during the processing of the application to identify amendments to address those elements of the scheme considered unacceptable. However, the necessary amendments to make the application acceptable were not forthcoming. "
