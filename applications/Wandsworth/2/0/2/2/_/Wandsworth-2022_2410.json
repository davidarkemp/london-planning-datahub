    "Reason : 1 - The proposal would fail to provide good standard of accommodation for future occupiers, especially at second floor level, where the proposed self-contained residential unit would not comply with minimum space standards. No details of refuse/recycle storage and arrangements and cycle storage  have been submitted as part of the proposal. Consequently, the proposal would fail to comply with locally adopted policies DMT2, DMH4, DMH6, DMH7 of the DMPD (2016) and SPD 'Refuse and recyclables in developments' (2014).\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably. In addition further guidance was offered to the applicant by the case officer during the processing of the application to identify amendments to address those elements of the scheme considered unacceptable. However, the necessary amendments to make the application acceptable are substantial and would materially change the development proposal. They would require further consultations to be undertaken prior to determination, which could not take place within the statutory determination period specified by the Department of Communities and Local Government. You are therefore encouraged to consider submission of a fresh application incorporating the material amendments set out below which are necessary to make the scheme acceptable. \r\n\r\nRequired amendments:\r\n1. To amend layout of the proposed residential unit at second floor level to comply with minimum space standards.\r\n2. To provide details of the refuse/recycle storage internallly and externally.\r\n3. To provide details of the cycle storage. \r\n"
