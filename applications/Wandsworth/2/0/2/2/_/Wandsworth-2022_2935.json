    "Reason : 1 - By reason of the siting of the development, it is considered that the proposed amendment to allow full height openable windows would create an unacceptable perception of overlooking to neighbouring residents, which would appear overbearing and cause unacceptable harm to neighbour amenity, contrary to Local Plan Policy LP2. ",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
