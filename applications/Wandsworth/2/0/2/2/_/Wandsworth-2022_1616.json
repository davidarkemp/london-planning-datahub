  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - By reason of it disproportionate housing mix and unjustified excessive number and layout of 1-bed units, the proposed development would have a detrimental impact on the character of the local area and harm local policy objectives of creating mixed and balanced communities.\r\nThe proposal therefore fails to comply with policy IS5 of the Wandsworth Core Strategy (20216), DMH3 of the Wandsworth Development Management Policies Document (2016) and policy LP24 of the Wandsworth Publication Version Local Plan (2023).",
    "Reason : 2 - By reason of it layout, unit configuration and design, the proposed development would result in a poor standard of accommodation with undersized units, a lack of adequate natural light and outlook. Furthermore, the applicant has failed to demonstrate that all future occupiers would have access to suitable external amenity space.\r\nThe proposal therefore fails to comply with policies D3 and D6 of the London Plan (2021), policies DMS1, DMH4, DMH6 and DMH7 of the Wandsworth Development Management Policies Document (2016) and policies LP1, LP2, LP7 and LP27 of the Wandsworth Publication Version Local Plan (2023).",
    "Reason : 3 - By reason of the proposed large roof terrace areas in close proximity to neighbouring boundaries habitable rooms, the proposed development would result in an unneighbourly addition and cause a detrimental impact in terms of privacy and noise disturbance for adjoining occupiers.\r\nThe proposal therefore fails to comply with policy DMS1 of the Wandsworth Development Management Policies Document (2016) and policies LP1 and LP2 of the Wandsworth Publication Version Local Plan (2023), and the guidance within the Wandsworth Housing Supplementary Planning Document (2016).\r\n",
    "Reason : 4 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably. In addition further guidance was offered to the applicant by the case officer during the processing of the application to identify amendments to address those elements of the scheme considered unacceptable. However, the necessary amendments to make the application acceptable are substantial and would materially change the development proposal. They would require further consultations to be undertaken prior to determination, which could not take place within the statutory determination period specified by the Department of Communities and Local Government.\r\n"
