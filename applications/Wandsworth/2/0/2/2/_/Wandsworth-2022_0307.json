  "description": "Alterations including erection of mansard roof extension to main rear roof and two storey rear extension in connection with conversion of property into 1 x 2 and 1 x 1 bedroom flats",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The development results in the conversion of a family-sized residential unit with less than 150sq.m of original habitable floor space (pre-2008) and which is considered suitable for families. The development would therefore result in\r\nharm to the existing choice of housing stock within the borough, and would fail to comply with policy DMH2 of the Wandsworth Development Management Policies Document (adopted 2016).\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - Due to the built-up party wall of the proposed mansard extension, the proposal would create an incongruous and awkward feature in relation to no. 39 Bickersteth Road, which would cause harm to the appearance of that property and the surrounding streetscene and would fail to comply with policies DMS1 and DMH5 of the Wandsworth Development Management Policies Document (adopted 2016) and the Wandsworth Housing SPD.\r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal. In relation to the roof extension, moving the extension inside of the party wall and finishing the side profile with hanging slate should overcome the concerns identified."
