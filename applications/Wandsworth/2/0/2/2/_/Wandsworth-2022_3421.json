    "Reason : 1 - The proposal constitutes development under the Town and Country Planning Act 1990, and the local planning authority is not satisfied that, based on the drawings submitted as part of the application, this proposal falls within any class of 'permitted development' specified within Schedule 2 to the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).\r\nINFORMATIVE: The proposed development fails to comply with the provisions of paragraph A.3(a) of Schedule 2 of Part 1 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended). This is because the in situ single-storey rear extension has black aluminium-framed sliding doors in its rear elevation whilst all other fenestration on the rear of the existing dwellinghouse is constructed of white uPVC.\r\n\r\n"
