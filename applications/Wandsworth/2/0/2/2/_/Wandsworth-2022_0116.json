  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The front and side boundary treatment by reason of the its materiality, height and constitutes an inappropriate and incongruous addition to the historic character and appearance of the host property. The developmenty therefore causes less than substantial harm to the character and appearance of the host dwelling and the heritage significance of this part of the Dover House Estate Conservation Area, and there are no public benefits to outweigh the harm caused. Consequently, the development is considered contrary to policies DMS1, DMS2 and DMH5 of the DMPD (2016), 'Housing' SPD (2016), policy HC1 of the London Plan (2021), section 72(1) of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990, and the NPPF.",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
