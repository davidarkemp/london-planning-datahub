    "Reason : 1 - The proposed roof terrace by reason of its scale, form and siting would constitute a dominant and obtrusive addition to the host building and would be a discordant feature in the context of the existing roof. The proposal would appear as an incongruous addition to the existing property and surrounding area and would thereby cause undue harm to the character and appearance of the building and area, contrary to the NPPF (2021), policy DMS1, DMH5 of the Wandsworth DMPD (2016) and the Housing SPD (2016).",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
