    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development, by reason of its scale, appearance and siting, is considered to cause undue harm to the character and appearance of the host property and surrounding area. The scheme would cause undue harm to the amenity of  surrounding residential occupiers in terms of being overbearing, causing overshadowing, loss of daylight/sunlight, creating an increased sense of enclosure and unsatisfactory outlook compared to the existing situation. The proposal would therefore fail to be in accordance with the NPPF, policies DMS1 and DMH5 of the Local Plan (DMPD) (2016); policy IS3 of the Local Plan (Core Strategy) (2016); policies D3 and D12 of the London Plan (2021); and the Local Plan SPD 'Housing' (2016).",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
