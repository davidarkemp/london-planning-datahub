    "Condition : 1 - This notice indicates that the proposed development would comply with Class A of Schedule 2 Part 1 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 2015 (as amended).  If you would like confirmation that the proposed development would be lawful, then you should submit an (optional) application to the local planning authority for a Lawful Development Certificate.\r\nIt is a requirement of condition A.4 (11) that the development shall be carried out in accordance with the details approved by the Local Planning Authority.\r\nThe materials used in any exterior work (other than materials used in the construction of a conservatory) must be of a similar appearance to those used in the construction of the exterior of the existing dwellinghouse.",
    "Condition : 2 - INFORMATIVE: You are reminded that this notice is issued on the basis of the physical circumstances prevailing at the property when the application was made.  If any other extension is undertaken BEFORE the construction of the extension, then this notice would no longer be applicable and planning permission may be required for the development presently proposed.\r\n",
    "Condition : 3 - INFORMATIVE: You are advised that this notice does not override your responsibilities under the Party Wall Act 1996.\r\n",
    "Condition : 4 - INFORMATIVE: This notice is based on the drawings and any other information as submitted being a true reflection of the physical circumstances prevailing at the site on the date of the submission of the application. If the existing conditions are different from those shown on the drawings or if the drawings or any other information are inaccurate in any way, the notice may not be valid.\r\n",
    "Reason : 1 - Provision A.4(7) of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended), requires that where any owner/occupier of any adjoin premises objects to a proposed development, the local planning authority must assess the impacts of the proposed development on the amenity impacts on neighbouring properties. \r\nOne objection was received with regards to residential amenity and as such, the application was assessed against the Local Planning Authority's policies in regard to neighbour amenity.\r\nBy reason of its scale and depth the development would lead to a loss of daylight and sunlight, be overbearing and would create an increased sense of enclosure to neighbouring properties and as such fails to comply with policy DMS1 of the Development Management Policies Document (2016), and Housing SPD (2016).\r\n"
