    "Reason : 1 - The applicant has failed to demonstrate that the proposed earlier opening hours would not result in the generation of unacceptable levels of noise disturbance associated with the increased levels of commercial activity generated by a typically noise intensive use during a period of lower ambient noise levels. As such, the proposed development would likely result in unacceptable harm to the amenity of neighbouring  occupiers and would fail to comply with policy DMS1 of the Development Management Policies Document (2016), policy IS4 of the Core Strategy (2016) and policies D13 and D14 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
