    "Reason : 1 - The proposed telecommunications mast and associated equipment would by reason of its siting and appearance be of an incongruous and visually intrusive scale and design, resulting in undue and excessive clutter in the open street scene, harming the visual amenities and spatial character of the locality, and the setting of the Clapham Common Conservation Area and openness of the Metropolitan Open Land (Clapham Common). The proposal would not meet with the relevant conditions attached to the Class A of Part 16 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order and would be contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Sections 66 (1) Section 72(1) of the Planning (Listed Building and Conservation Areas) Act 1990, policies HC1, SI6 and G3 of the London Plan (2021), policy IS3 of the Wandsworth Core Strategy (2016), policies DMS1, DMS2, DMO1 and DMS9 of the Wandsworth Development Management Policies Document (2016).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed telecommunications mast and associated equipment, by reason of its scale and siting, would create an unnecessary obstruction of the highway and adjoining public space, which would hinder convenient and safe public passage given the demands placed on it in this location. The proposal would not meet with the conditions attached to the relevant Class A of Part 16 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order and would be contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policies T1, T2 and T4 of the London Plan (2021), policy IS3 of the Wandsworth Core Strategy (2016), policies DMS1, DMS9 and DMT1 of the Wandsworth Development Management Policies Document (2016) and the guidance within the TfL's Streetscape Guidance Publication (2017).",
