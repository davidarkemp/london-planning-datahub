  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - By reason of its design, scale and location, the proposed development would provide a poor standard of accommodation which would harm the amenities of future occupiers due to limited outlook and privacy, lack of dedicated external amenity space and a cramped undersized internal layout. Furthermore, the proposed development would provide a poor living environment in terms of noise and nuisance from adjoining established commercial and storage uses, prejudicing the regular activity and growth of the established commercial parade and associated rear storage uses. The proposal therefore fails to comply with the Technical Housing Standards - nationally described space standard (2015), policies D6 and D13 of the London Plan (2021), policies DMS1, DMH4, DMH6 and DMH7 of the Development Management Policies Document (2016), policies LP2, LP27 and LP42 of the Wandsworth Publication Version Local Plan (Regulation 19 Version) (2022) and the guidance within the Wandsworth Housing SPD (2016).",
    "Reason : 2 - The applicant has failed to demonstrate that the siting of the proposed cycle parking and waste storage would not hinder the function, or impede on the existing shared access requirements, of the adjoining commercial and storage premises. Therefore, the proposed development would provide inadequate means of sustainable transport provision and adverse waste management, failing to comply with policy T5 of the London Plan (2021), policies DMS1, DMT2 and DMS1 of the Development Management Policies Document (2016), policies LP2, LP13, LP50 and LP51 of the Wandsworth Publication Version Local Plan (Regulation 19 Version) (2022) and the guidance within the Refuse and recyclables in developments SPD (2014).\r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
