    "Reason : 1 - The development by reason of its scale, siting, bulk and design would result in an incongruous and overbearing form of development. The proposal would cause undue harm to the visual amenity, character and appearance of the building, the streetscene and the heritage significance of this part of the West Putney Conservation Area contrary to Policies DMS1, DMS2 and DMH5 of the DMPD (2016), Housing SPD (2016) and West Putney Conservation Area Management Strategy,  Section 72 (1) of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990, Policy HC1(C) of the London Plan (2021) and paragraphs 199 and 202 of the NPPF (2021).",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
