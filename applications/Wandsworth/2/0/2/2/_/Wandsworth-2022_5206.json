    "Condition : 6 - INFORMATIVE: Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL): From the information available, it appears that the development permitted is subject to a Community Infrastructure Levy charge in accordance with the Community Infrastructure Levy Regulations 2010 (as amended) (the \"Regulations\"). \r\nYou or the relevant interested parties are required to provide the Council with the information set out in the Regulations.

    "Condition : 7 - INFORMATIVE: Any assessment of CIL liability by the Council has been based on the information provided. The assessment of CIL liability referred to in this informative is indicative only and is not intended to provide a binding estimate of the actual CIL liability likely to be incurred.  The assessment of the actual CIL liability will be provided pursuant to and in accordance with the Community Infrastructure Levy Regulations 2010 (as amended).  Where the calculation of CIL liability includes taking account of the existing use of a building, CIL liability may change if the information provided in relation to the existing use(s) of buildings, is not still current at the time of the decision which first permits development."
