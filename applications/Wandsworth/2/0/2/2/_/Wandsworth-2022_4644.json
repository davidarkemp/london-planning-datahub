    "Reason : 1 - The proposed roof extensions, by reason of their siting, scale and design, would constitute an unsympathetic, discordant and incongruous form of development. They would relate poorly to, and would result in harm to the visual amenity of the host property, the terrace, and wider area, contrary to policies DMS1 and DMH5 of the DMPD and the guidance set out in the Councils Housing SPD.",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
