    "Reason : 1 - The proposed extension by reason of it's scale, design and location would result in a dominant and unsympathetic addition to the harm of the character and appearance of the host building and local visual amenity. The development would therefore fail to comply with the NPPF (2021), policy DMS1 or DMH5 of the Wandsworth Development Management Policies Document (2016), the Housing SPD (2016) and policies LP1 and LP5 of the Wandsworth Publication Version Local Plan (Regulation 19 Version). ",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed extension, by reason of its siting, scale and design would constitute an unneighbourly form of development that would harm the amenity of the neighbouring property in the form of loss of outlook,  being overbearing and creating an increased sense of enclosure. The application has also failed to demonstrate that there would not be unacceptable harm to neighbouring windows in respect to reductions in daylight. The development would therefore fail to comply with policy DMS1 of the Development Management Policies Document (2016), the Housing SPD (2016) and policy LP2 of the Wandsworth Publication Version Local Plan (Regulation 19 Version). ",
    "Reason : 3 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the proposal is contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
