  "decision_date": "18/04/2023",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - By reason of scale, design and prominent location, the proposed extension to the main roof would constitute a prominent, unsympathetic and incongruous form of development that would relate poorly to the existing dwelling, to neighbouring properties and wider Salcott Road streetscene.  The proposed development would result in less than substantial harm to the character and appearance of the Wandsworth Common Conservation Area but there are no public benefits that would outweigh the identified harm. For these reasons the proposal would be contrary to Policy PL1 of the Wandsworth Local Plan Core Strategy (2016) and Policies DMS1, DMS2 and DMH5 of the Wandsworth Local Plan Development Management Planning Document, the Wandsworth Housing SPD (2016), PVLP (2023) policies LP1, LP3 and LP5 and the Wandsworth Common Conservation Area Appraisal & Management Strategy.",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
