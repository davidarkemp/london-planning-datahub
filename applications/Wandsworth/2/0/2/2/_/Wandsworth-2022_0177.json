  "description": "Variation of condition 4 pursuant to planning permission dated 24/09/2020 ref 2020/2716 (Alterations including erection of dormer roof extension to main roof and replacement roof to existing single storey rear extension. Installation of replacement double glazed windows to front, rear and side elevations at ground and first floor levels.) to allow the use of fibre cement boarding for the cladding of the new dormer and allow for the replacement windows to be constructed of UPVC. [amended description]",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed replacement windows by reason of their design, detailing and materiality are considered to be inappropriate additions as they do not faithfully replicate what would have been there originally when the estate was built. The proposal would therefore fail to conserve or enhance the character and appearance of the host dwelling and the heritage significance of this part of the Dover House Estate Conservation Area, and there are no public benefits to outweigh the harm caused. Consequently, the proposal is considered contrary to policies DMS1, DMS2 and DMH5 of the DMPD (2016), 'Housing' SPD (2016), policy HC1 of the London Plan (2021), section 72(1) of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990, and the NPPF. ",
    "Reason : 2 - By reason of the proposed materiality and appearance of the proposed cladding to the rear dormer, it is considered that it would constitute an inappropriate and incongruous addition to the historic character and appearance of the application property. The proposal would therefore fail to conserve or enhance the character and appearance of the host dwelling and the heritage significance of this part of the Dover House Estate Conservation Area, and there are no public benefits to outweigh the harm caused. Consequently, the proposal is considered contrary to policies DMS1, DMS2 and DMH5 of the DMPD (2016), 'Housing' SPD (2016), policy HC1 of the London Plan (2021), section 72(1) of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990, and the NPPF.",
    "Reason : 3 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
