    "Reason : 1 - The development would by reason of its excessive scale and massing to the rear of the host site as well as the poor deisgn would be an incongruous addition to the building and cause undue harm to the character of the host site and surrounding area as well as unbalance the pair of semi-detached properties to the detriment of the visual amenity and wider character of the street scene. \r\nThe proposal therefore fails to comply with policies DMS1 and DMH5 of the Development Management Policies Document (2016), and  Housing SPD (2016).\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal.",
