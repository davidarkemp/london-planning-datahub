  "description": "TPO 133/1990 - T3 Oak (Tree along the Queensmere Road boundary) To fell: When climbing this tree, evidence of multiple fungal fruiting bodies was found in several different locations within the canopy. At one particular point on the main stem at approximately 15-20 feet high there was found to be an old wound which has severely rotted in, to the extent that the trunk has become hollow and at present has a bees nest in residence and the tree surgeon was able to push a stick a significant way into the cavity (see attached photos and videos) leading to serious concerns as to the structural integrity of the tree, especially given the trees location along the Queensmere Road boundary and its close proximity to the nursery school entrance/exit gate where children and parents regularly congregate.",
