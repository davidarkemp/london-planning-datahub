    "Reason : 1 - The retention and alteration of the air-con units would by reason of their siting and design represent unacceptable installations to the building which would fail to respect the design language or French Gothic and Scottish Baronial aesthetic style of the listed building. They would detract from the special architectural interest and historic character of the building failing to preserve its character to the detriment of its overall aesthetic creating no significant public benefit whilst resulting in less than substantial harm. As such, the units would not be in accordance with DMPD policies DMS1 and DMS2 and Section 72  of the Listed Building Act (1990) and the NPPF (2021).",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
