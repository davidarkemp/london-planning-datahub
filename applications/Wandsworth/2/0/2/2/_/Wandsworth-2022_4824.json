    "Reason : 1 - The proposed roof extensions by reason of their scale, siting, discordant design and materiality, would cause undue harm to the character and appearance of the property and cause less than substantial harm to the character, appearance and heritage significance of the Conservation Area. In the absence of any heritage or public benefits to outweigh this harm, the proposals fail to meet the criteria of DMS1, DMS2 and DMH5, as well as not being in accordance with Section 72 (1) of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990, Policy HC1(C) of the London Plan (2021) and paragraph 199 of the NPPF (2021).",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
