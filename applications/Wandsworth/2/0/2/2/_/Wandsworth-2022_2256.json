    "Reason : 1 - The proposed dwelling by reason of its location, orientation and design would provide a substandard level of accommodation and future occupants would have inadequate outlook and insufficient access to natural light. Further, the dwelling would have no outdoor amenity space, contrary to Policy DMH7 of the DMPD. It is therefore considered that the proposed dwelling would provide an unacceptable standard of accommodation, contrary to Policy DMH4 of the DMPD and Policy DMH7 of the DMPD.   ",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
