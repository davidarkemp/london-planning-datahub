    "Reason : 1 - The proposed roof extension by reason of its size, location and design would result in an unsympathetic and incongruous addition to the host dwelling resulting in less than substantial harm to the Charlwood Road/Lifford Street Conservation Area without public benefits to outweigh this harm. The proposal would therefore fail to accord with the statutory duty of the 1990 Act, paragraphs 190, 200 and 202 of the NPPF (2021), policies IS3 of Core Strategy (2016) and policies DMS1, DMS2 and DMH 5 of the DMPD (2016) in addition to the Charlwood Road and Lifford Street Conservation Area Appraisal and Management Strategy",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
