In addition, where appropriate, further guidance was offered to the applicant during the processing of the application.  ",
    "Condition : 8 - INFORMATIVE: As the site is adjacent to Network Rail's operational railway\ninfrastructure, Network Rail strongly recommends the developer contacts\nAssetProtectionAnglia@networkrail.co.uk prior to any works commencing on\nsite, specifically with regards to future maintenance, drainage, scaffolding,\npiling and fencing. Network Rail strongly recommends the developer agrees an Asset Protection Agreement with us to enable approval of detailed works.\nMore information can also be obtained from the Network Rail website at\nwww.networkrail.co.uk/aspx/1538.aspx. The Applicant is also advised that the full details of the comments provided by Network Rail can be accessed from the Council website at www.wandsworth.gov.uk.",
    "Condition : 9 - INFORMATIVE - Common Frog: This property is in an area known to support\nthe common frog (Rana temporaria) which are undergoing rapid population\ndecline. We recommend that any construction / scaffolding works that involve disturbance to or loss of wetlands including damp areas within private gardens should be undertaken in autumn only, to prevent disruption to over wintering and breeding populations. Further advice on this can be gained from the council's Biodiversity advisor by emailing biodiversity@enablelc.org or by phoning 020 3959 0060.",
    "Condition : 10 - INFORMATIVE - House Sparrow: This property is in an area known to host\nHouse sparrow (Passer domesticus) a species undergoing severe population\ndecline. Nests are often placed in holes and crevices within buildings and as\nsuch they are vulnerable to construction and development work inadvertently destroying nests and nest sites We recommend that any works including any preparatory work and / or scaffolding is undertaken outside the nesting season (Feb- August) to prevent breaches of the law with regard to nesting birds. We would also encourage the applicant to include provision for nest spaces within the redevelopment - further advice on this can be gained from the council's Biodiversity advisor by emailing biodiversity@enablelc.org or by phoning 020 3959 0060.",
    "Condition : 11 - INFORMATIVE - Stag Beetles: There is evidence that stag beetles (Lucanus\ncervus) are in the vicinity of the site. Stag beetles spend much of their life cycle in larvae form occupying dead wood. The proposed works (or activity\nassociated with their implementation) may do harm stag beetles or their\nhabitat. Given the evidence of stag beetles in the area it would also be prudent to create potential new habitats for stag beetles. Further information, on this can be gained from the council's Biodiversity specialists by emailing\nbiodiversity@enablelc.org or by phoning 020 3959 0060. Whilst bats\nare also recorded from the vicinity, the proposed works should not have any\nimpact upon potential roost spaces. ",
    "Condition : 12 - INFORMATIVE - Swifts: This property is in an area known to host swifts (Apus apus) a species undergoing population decline. Nests are often placed under the eaves of buildings and as such they are vulnerable to construction and development work inadvertently destroying nests and nest sites. We\nrecommend that any works including preparatory work, demolition, scaffolding and new constructions are undertaken outside the nesting season (Feb - August) to prevent breaches of the law with regard to nesting birds. We would also encourage the applicant to include provision for nest spaces within the redevelopment - further advice on this can be gained from the council's Biodiversity advisor by emailing biodiversity@enablelc.org or by phoning 020 3959 0060.",
    "Condition : 13 - INFORMATIVE: The adjoining Railway lineside around Streatham Junction\nSite of Borough Importance for Nature Conservation may not in any way be\nused for the purpose of effecting the works, including (but not limited to)\naccess and storage of materials / waste and / or positioning of scaffolding or\nwelfare units at any time for any purpose.\nReason: to ensure that no damage occurs to the site nor that there is any loss of quality or condition of the biodiversity value of the site. \n"
