An assessment of the drawings provided suggests that the total roof volume to be added by the proposed development would exceed 50 cubic metres, as prohibited by paragraph B.1(d)(ii) of Class B of Part 1 of Schedule 2 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 2015 (as amended)."
