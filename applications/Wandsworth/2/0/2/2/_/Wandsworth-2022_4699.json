    "Reason : 1 - The proposed amendments do not constitute minor material amendments and the principle of a section 73 application to consider these amendments is not acceptable.  ",

    "Reason : 3 - The removal of the proposed balustrade between the first floor level rear terraces would result in an undue loss of privacy, contrary to the provisions of policy DMS1 of the Councils Development Management Policies Document (DMPD) (2016).",
    "Reason : 4 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
