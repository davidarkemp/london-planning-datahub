    "Reason : 1 - The proposed insertion of 4 x windows within the front elevation, by reason of their historically inaccurate siting, would result in the over perforation of the same elevation and hence the unacceptable erosion of the historical design intent of the host building, thus failing to preserve the architectural integrity of the building resulting in harm to its significance. The development would therefore cause harm to the non-designated heritage asset which would fail to be preserved or enhanced which is contrary to Wandsworth Borough Council policies DMS1 and DMS2 of the DMPD (2016), Policy HC1 of the London Plan (2021) and paragraph 203 of the NPPF (2021).",
    "Reason : 2 - The applicant has failed to submit a robust Fire Statement which addresses the requirements of Policy D12(A) of the London Plan (2021) to the satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority. It has therefore not been demonstrated that the proposed development would achieve the highest standards of fire safety, contrary to Policy D12 of the London Plan (2021). ",
    "Reason : 3 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
