    "Condition : 1 - The development hereby permitted shall be begun within 3 years from the date of this permission.\nReason: To prevent the accumulation of unimplemented planning permissions and to comply with Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended) and to meet the requirements of Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004 and to meet the requirements of The Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015.\n",
    "Condition : 2 - The development shall be carried out in accordance with the reports, specifications and drawings detailed 690-01 Site Location Plan A3; 690-101 Existing Site Plan A3; 690-111 General Arrangement Plan A1; 690-130 Existing Elevation A3; 690-131 Proposed Elevation A3; 690-301 Planting and Habitat Creation Plan A1; 690-351 Playground Design and Play Elements A3; 690-501 Materials, Furniture and Planting Palette; 690-150 Sections A-A A3; 690-151 Sections A-A A3; 690-551 Design and Access Statement and Aboricultural Report (October 2022 - 220892-PD-11).\nReason: To ensure a satisfactory standard of development and to allow the local planning authority to review any potential changes to the scheme. \n",
    "Condition : 3 - Prior to the commencement of the development Tree Protection measures in line with BS5837:2012 shall be installed and no works or materials/plant storage shall be undertaken within the protected area, unless otherwise agreed in writing. The protection measures shall be retained until completion of the development. \nReason: To preserve trees and hedges on the site in the interests of visual amenity and the character of the area, in accordance with Council policy DMO5 of the Development Management Policies Document (adopted March 2016) coupled with the requirements of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021.\n",
    "Condition : 4 - The development permitted by this planning permission shall only be carried out in accordance with the approved Flood Risk Assessment [by Metis Consultants Ltd dated December 2022].\nThe mitigation measures shall be retained as such.\nReason: To reduce the risk of flooding to the proposed development and future occupants, and third parties in accordance with policy DMS5 of the Development Management Policies Document (adopted March 2016) coupled with the requirements of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021.\n",
    "Condition : 5 - INFORMATIVE: Prior to commencement it is recommended the applicant liaise with the Council's Biodiversity Officer to mitigate the construction effects as part of a coordinated and collaborative approach with surrounding developments. It is suggested the following should be considered:\na) whilst it is recommended that works take place outside of the nesting season (February - September), if works are unavoidable during this period, then it is recommended that a site walk over at least 48 hours prior to works commencing is required by a named CIEEM accredited ecologist with experience of working in London to check for any nesting birds (including all buildings, any construction materials onsite and any trees and other vegetation). In the event that a nest is found, an appropriate exclusion zone should be implemented around it until the young have fully fledged (Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 (as amended)). The law protects all wild bird species, their eggs and nests;\nb) consideration of sensitive removal of any vegetation onsite;\nc) consideration of a precautionary bat mitigation plan if tree T6 is removed;\nd) consideration of a construction lighting plan outlining how lighting will be prevented from negatively impacting any protected and priority species during construction, in particular commuting bats. This construction lighting plan should follow the best practice industry guidance outlined in the Bat Conservation Trust (BCT) and Institute of Lighting Professionals (ILP) Guidance Note (2018);\ne) ways to prevent mammal, amphibian or reptile entrapment or harm on site, including in excavations and construction and waste materials left on site;\nf) a potential Invasive Non-Native Species plan detailing the measures to be taken to manage any INNS (including species on the London Invasive Species Initiative (LISI) list)\n",
    "Condition : 6 - INFORMATIVE: In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework 2021 to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application.  The Council has made available detailed advice in the form of its statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning Documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre-application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably. In addition, where appropriate, further guidance was offered to the applicant during the processing of the application.  "
