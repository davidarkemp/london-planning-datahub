    "Reason : 1 - By reason of the siting and orientation of the fenestration proposed, it is considered that the proposed dwelling would provide future occupants with an inadequate outlook and insufficient access to natural light, in sufficient detriment to living conditions. Further, the floorspace of the proposed dwelling would be below minimum standards and the outdoor amenity space would also be below minimum standards. It is therefore considered that the proposed dwelling would provide an unacceptable standard of accommodation, contrary to Policies DMH4 and DMH7 of the DMPD.  ",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
