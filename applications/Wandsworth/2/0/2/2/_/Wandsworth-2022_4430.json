  "decision_date": "22/12/2022",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "Condition : 1 - The development hereby permitted shall be begun within 3 years from the date of this permission.\r\nReason: To prevent the accumulation of unimplemented planning permissions and to comply with Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended) and to meet the requirements of Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004 and to meet the requirements of The Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015.\r\n",
    "Condition : 2 - The development shall be carried out in accordance with the reports, specifications and drawings detailed [**************]. \r\nReason: To ensure a satisfactory standard of development and to allow the local planning authority to review any potential changes to the scheme. \r\n",
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed pergola structure and associated external seating area would by reason of it's scale, design and location result in adverse levels of noise and disturbance that would have a harmful impact on the amenity of the neighbouring occupiers. Given the number of people that could occupy the area it would also constitute an unneighbourly form of development through actual and perceived overlooking and loss of privacy to neighbouring properties. The proposed extension would therefore be contrary to policy DMS1 (c) of the Development Management Policies Document (2016) and emerging policy LP2 (b) of the Publication Version Local Plan (Regulation 19 Version) (2022).",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
