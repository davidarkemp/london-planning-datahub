    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development would result in the loss of existing community floorspace and the application has failed to demonstrate that there is no demonstrable current or future demand for the space; or that replacement provision, that suits current or future community needs would be provided in a suitable location; or that the premises would no longer be suitable to continue in community use. The development would therefore be contrary to policy DMC1 of the Development Management Policies Document (2016) as well as policy LP17 of the PVLP (2022).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed change of use to a private residential dwelling (Class C3) would result in a loss of public access to the last remaining accessible part of this former institution and thereby harm the significance of the heritage asset. The less than substantial harm would not be outweighed by any public benefits amounting from the development proposals.  The development proposals would therefore fail to comply with Section 66 (1) of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990, the NPPF (2021), policy HC1 (C) of the London Plan (2021), Core Strategy (2016) policies PL1 and IS3 and DMPD (2016) policies DMS1 and DMS2 of the Development Management Policies Document (2016) as well as policy LP3 of the PVLP (2022).",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed development would provide substandard residential accommodation for occupiers with poor levels of privacy through actual and perceive overlooking. In addition, the application has failed to demonstrate that the residential unit be fully self-contained resulting in further loss of privacy and potential harmful noise and disturbance from use of the art gallery/photographic studio. The development would therefore be contrary to policy DMS1 and DMH4 of the Development Management Policies Document (2016) as well as policy LP27 of the PVLP (2022).",
    "Reason : 4 - In the absence of a Flood Risk Assessment, it has not been demonstrated that the proposal would not be at risk from flooding or result in increased risk of flooding in the surrounding area. The proposal is therefore contrary to the NPPF (2021) and policy DMS5 (Flood Risk Management) of the Development Management Policies Document (2016) as well as policy LP12 of the PVLP (2022).",
    "Reason : 5 - In the absence of a Planning Fire Safety Strategy, it has not been demonstrated that the proposal would achieve the highest standards of fire safety. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy D12 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "Reason : 6 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
