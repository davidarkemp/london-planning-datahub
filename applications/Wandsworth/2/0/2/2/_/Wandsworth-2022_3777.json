    "Reason : 1 - The proposed illuminated advertisement would by reason of its height, size and prominent location would result in a visually intrusive and unsympathetic feature to the existing property and the streetscape to the detriment of the local visual amenity. In addition, the proposal would be caused less than substantial harm to the special architectural and historic interest of the setting of the Grade II listed Parish Pump and Grade II listed Church of St Nicolas. Due to the location, scale and illumination, the proposed advertisement would be an obtrusive form of development that would result in harm to the amenity of neighbouring occupiers. The proposal would therefore be contrary to policies HC1C, D3 and D8B of the London Plan (2021), DMS1, DMS2, DMT1 and DMS8 of the DMPD (2016), the NPPF (2021) and the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990, together with emerging policies LP1, LP2, LP3 and LP9 of the PVLP (2022). \r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
