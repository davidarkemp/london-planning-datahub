    "Reason : 1 - The provision of additional hardstanding, the removal of the existing boundary treatment would cause less than substantial harm to the character, appearance and significance of Wandsworth Common Conservation Area.  In accordance with the NPPF this harm is weighed against public benefits.  In this instance no public benefits can be identified.  The proposal is therefore unacceptable contrary to the provisions of the NPPF, adopted DMPD (2016) policies DMS1, DMS2 and DMH5, and emerging Local Plan policies LP2, LP3 and LP5.",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposal would also result in the provision of 2 off street car parking spaces within the curtilage of the site and the loss of an on-street car parking space, contrary to the provisions of adopted DMPD (2016) policy DMT2, emerging Local Plan policy LP51 and London Plan (2021) policy T6.  ",
    "Reason : 3 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
