    "Reason : 1 - 1.Evidence supplied to support this reason is insufficient to show that the Oak has caused damage. \r\nCrack monitoring does not show seasonal movement, as predicted in Engineering Appraisal. There is insufficient information of damage to implicate the oak tree and no ground floor damage is reported. \r\nLevel monitoring shows the greatest movement is furthest away from the oak tree. No bore holes were dug here. The Arboricultural Report does not consider other vegetation close to this movement.\r\n\r\n2. The repairs detailed are based on the Engineering Appraisal, which is dated before monitoring began. The implications made are not valid, based on the further evidence detailed above.\r\n\r\n3. Not an arboricultural reason, not relevant.\r\n\r\n4. Severe reductions are proven to reduce water uptake of trees, and therefor are a reliable remedy to tree related subsidence. This is only relevant in cases where the tree is the cause. \r\n\r\n5.  We are not satisfied the evidence supplied is enough to prove the oak tree is causing the damage for the above reasons.\r\n\r\n6. Not an arboricultural reason, not relevant.\r\n"
