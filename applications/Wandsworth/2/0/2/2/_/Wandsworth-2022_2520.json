Furthermore, the development fails to provide dedicated external amenity space to any of the proposed dwellings. The proposal therefore fails to comply with policy D6 of the London Plan (2021), policies DMS1, DMH4 and DMH7 of the Wandsworth Development Management Policies Document (2016), policies LP1, LP7, and LP27 of the Wandsworth Publication Version Local Plan (Regulation 19 Version) (2022) and the the guidance within the Wandsworth Housing Supplementary Planning Document (2016).\r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - The applicant has failed to demonstrate that the proposal would provide an acceptable level of cycle parking, failing to promote sustainable travel modes for future occupiers. The proposal therefore fails to comply with policies T1,T4 and T6 of the London Plan (2021), policies DMT2 of the Wandsworth Development Management Policies Document (2016) and policies LP50 and LP51 of the Wandsworth Publication Version Local Plan (Regulation 19 Version) (2022).",
    "Reason : 4 - By reason of a lack of dedicate residential and commercial waste store, the development would cause harm to the amenities of existing and future occupiers in terms of general amenity and hygiene on site.  The proposal therefore fails to comply with policy DMS1 of the Wandsworth Development Management Policies Document (2016), policies LP1 and LP13 of the Wandsworth Publication Version Local Plan (Regulation 19 Version) (2022) and the Wandsworth Refuse and recyclables in developments Supplementary Planning Document (2015).\r\n",
