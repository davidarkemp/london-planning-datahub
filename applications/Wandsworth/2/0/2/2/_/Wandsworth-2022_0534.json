    "Reason : 1 - The proposed solar panels by reason of their scale and siting would constitute inappropriate and incongruous additions to the roof of the property which would detract from the special character of this property and group of properties. The panels would cause harm to the character, appearance and heritage significance of the Conservation Area. The proposal would cause less than substantial harm to the conservation area but with no public benefit identified, contrary to the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 and paragraphs 199, 200, and 202 of the NPPF, as well as local policies DMS1 and DMS2 of the DMPD (2016).",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
