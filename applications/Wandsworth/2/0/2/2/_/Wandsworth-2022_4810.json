    "Reason : 1 - The proposal constitutes development under the Town and Country Planning Act 1990, and the local planning authority is not satisfied that, based on the drawings submitted as part of the application, this proposal falls within any class of 'permitted development' specified within Schedule 2 to the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).\r\nINFORMATIVE: The proposed development would fail to comply with the provisions of paragraphs A.1(g)(ii), A.1(j)(i) and A.1(j)(iii) of Class A of Part 1 of Schedule 2 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 2015. This is because the enlarged part of the dwellinghouse would have a single storey and would exceed 4 metres in height; the enlarged part of the dwellinghouse would extend beyond a wall forming a side elevation of the original dwellinghouse and would exceed 4 metres in height; and the enlarged part of the dwellinghouse would extend beyond a wall forming a side elevation of the original dwellinghouse and would have a width greater than half the width of the original dwellinghouse."
