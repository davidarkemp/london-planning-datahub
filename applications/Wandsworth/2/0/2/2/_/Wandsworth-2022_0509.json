    "Reason : 1 - The proposed roof terrace, by reason of its location, scale and design, would be an incongruous and unsightly form of development which would have an undue impact on the visual amenity, character and appearance of the host dwelling and terrace of which it forms part. The proposed terrace would be unduly harmful to the amenity of neighbouring occupiers in the form of allowing overlooking, loss of privacy and noise disturbance compared to the existing situation and as such the proposal would fail to comply with policy D6 of the London Plan (2021), locally adopted policies IS3 of the Core Strategy (2016), DMS1and DMH5 of the Councils adopted DMPD (2016) and SPD 'Housing' (2016).",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
