    "Reason : 1 - The roof extensions would by reason of their excessive bulk and scale represent an incongruous and awkward form of development that would dominate the existing building. They would fail to physically integrate with their surroundings and would detract from the local spatial character and would not be in accordance with the NPPF (2021), policy DMS1 or DMH5 of the Wandsworth DMPD (2016), the Housing SPD (2016) or emerging policies LP1 and LP5 contained within the PVLP (2022). \r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The roof extensions by reason of their scale, design and siting constitutes an unneighbourly form of development that harms the amenity of the neighbouring property in the form of loss outlook, being overbearing and creating an increased sense of enclosure. The application has also failed to demonstrate that there would not be unacceptable harm to neighbouring windows in respect to reductions in daylight and sunlight. The development is therefore contrary to policy DMS1 of the Development Management Policies Document (2016) and the Housing SPD (2015) and emerging policy LP2 of the PVLP (2022).",
    "Reason : 3 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
