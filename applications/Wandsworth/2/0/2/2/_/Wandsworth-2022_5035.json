    "Reason : 1 - By reason of siting, scale and design, the roof extension would constitute an unsympathetic and incongruous form of development that relates poorly to the host building and adjoining local streetscape. The  development  results in less than substantial harm to the character and appearance of the Wandsworth Common Conservation Area, for which no significant public benefits have been identified that would outweigh the harm caused to the special character and appearance of the conservation area. Accordingly, the development fails to conform to Section 72(1) of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990, the NPPF (2023), policy HC1 of the London Plan (2021), policies LP1, LP3 and LP5 of the Wandsworth Local Plan (2023), and the guidance within the Housing SPD (2016) and the Wandsworth Common Conservation Area Appraisal and Management Strategy: Sub Area J - Bolingbroke Grove (2008).",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
