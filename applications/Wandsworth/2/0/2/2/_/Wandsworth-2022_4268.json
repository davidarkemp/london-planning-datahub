The skylights shall so be maintained and retained as such. \r\nReason: To control overlooking and safeguard the privacy of neighbours in accordance with Council policy DMS1(c) of the Development Management Policies Document (adopted March 2016) coupled with the requirements of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021.",
