    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development by reason of its scale and design the proposed access and egress would fail to comply with Class AA(1)(c), Part 20, Schedule 2 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 2015 (GDPO) as amended.",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed development would be within 3 km of the perimeter of an aerodrome, which is used by aircraft engaged in the public transport of passengers and therefore would fail to comply with Class AA.1.(o)(vii), Part 20, Schedule 2 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 2015 (GDPO) as amended.",

    "Reason : 3 - INFORMATIVE: Please note if the proposal did not fail to comply with the GPDO in relation to the above, the proposal by reason its scale, design and siting would constitute an unneighbourly form of development, that would have a detrimental impact on the amenity of neighbouring properties in the form of a combined loss of light, outlook, being overbearing and creating an increased sense of enclosure. As such, the proposal would have failed to comply with Class AA.2(1)(g), Part 20, Schedule 2 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 2015 (GDPO) as amended, in addition to the NPPF (2021) and policy DMS1 of the Development Management Policies Document (2016) and the guidance within the Housing SPD (2016).\r\n"
