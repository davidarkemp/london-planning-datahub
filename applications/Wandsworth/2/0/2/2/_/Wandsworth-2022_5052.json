  "description": "Location: Rear Communal Area 1. Atlas Cedar: Damaged in recent storms, resulting in tree potentially unsafe, with a moderate to substantial risk of future failure. a) Section fell to near ground level. b) Grind down stump to 300mm below ground level. East Boundary 3. London Plane: Mature specimen located on the east boundary over hanging neighbouring car parking area. last pruned five to six years ago, and has put on three to four meters of regrowth: To manage crown spread sand volume reduce regrowth back to most previous points of reduction, retaining suitable growth points, remove dead branches. Current crown height and spread 16m After proposed works: Crown height and spread 13m 6. Lawson Cypress: Adjacent to rear elevation and low brick wall. An upright slow growing Cypress currently affecting low low brick wall, but providing seclusion and shelter to bottom flat. Remove branches encroaching on wall. Inspect every two years 9. Apple Tree: Reduce and reshape crown by 1.5m to rounded form. Formative prune. I would advise a two-year cyclical pruning program. 10. Lilac: Over mature and overhanging main pathway. Potential to fail soon. Reduce to 2.5m and shape to form.",
