    "Reason : 1 - The development results in an incongruous and visually intrusive addition to the rear elevation of the property, out of character with the predominant local pattern of development. It is therefore contrary to policy DMS1 of the Development Management Policies Document (2016), and policy LP1 of the Local Plan Publication (Regulation 19) version with modifications (2023).",
    "Reason : 2 - The development, by reason of its design and siting, results in unacceptable impact in terms of noise and disturbance nuisance to the neighbouring residential properties to the harm of their amenities. Insufficient details have been provided in respect of noise and attenuation to reduce impact on the neighbouring residential properties. The development is therefore contrary to policy DMS1 of the Development Management Policies Document (2016) and policy LP2 of the Local Plan Publication (Regulation 19) version with modifications (2023).",
    "Reason : 3 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
