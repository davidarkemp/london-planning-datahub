    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development would constitute an unneighbourly form of development that would harm the amenity of neighbouring properties in the form of unacceptable loss of daylight and outlook. The proposal has not overcome the previous reason for refusal and would therefore be contrary to policies DMS1 of the Wandsworth Development Management Policies Document (2016) and the Wandsworth Housing SPD (2016).",
    "Reason : 2 - By reason of its scale, bulk and siting, the proposal would constitute an unsympathetic and incongruous form of development that would dominate and compete with the existing building. It would relate poorly to the neighbouring properties and would harm the local spatial character. The development has not overcome the previous reason for refusal and would be contrary to policies PL1 and IS3 of the Wandsworth Core Strategy (2016), policies DMS1 and DMH5 of the Wandsworth Development Management Policies Document (2016) and the Wandsworth Housing SPD (2016).",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed development would provide a substandard level of accommodation as the proposed residential dwellings would not benefit from any dedicated outdoor amenity space. The proposal has not overcome the previous reason for refusal and would therefore be contrary to policy DMH7 of the Wandsworth Development Management Policies Document (2016).",
    "Reason : 4 - The proposal would result in a poor standard of accommodation with poor levels of daylight/sunlight and outlook for the bedroom of the 1 bedroom flat on the second floor. The proposal would therefore be contrary to policies DMS1 and DMH4 of the Development Management Policies Document (2016).",
    "Reason : 5 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
