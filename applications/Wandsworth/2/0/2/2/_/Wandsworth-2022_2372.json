    "Reason : 1 - Condition 3 - Landscaping \r\nConflicting information has been submitted about the extent of soft landscaping coverage.  The details submitted with this application indicate much of the land not covered by buildings would be covered by non-porous paving contrary to the provisions of DMPD (2016) policy DMS6.  \r\n\r\nCondition 4 - Materials \r\nThe texture and colour of the proposed  brickwork is not appropriate in this location and it would not relate well to positive aspects of the Spencer Road, which is a road with high townscape value within St Johns Hill Conservation Area.  Information about the materiality of the architrave and parapet have not been provided.  Overall the proposals would not accord with the provisions of policies DMS1 and DMS2 of the Councils adopted DMPD (2016).  \r\n\r\nCondition 5 - Boundary Treatment \r\nThe proposed rendered wall and associated gates would not relate to positive features in the conservation area.  The proposed gate would be somewhat industrial in appearance.  Overall these aspects of the proposal cause harm to the street scene and would not accord with DMPD policies DMS1 and DMS2.  Details of the side and rear boundaries have not been provided which is also not acceptable.  \r\n"
