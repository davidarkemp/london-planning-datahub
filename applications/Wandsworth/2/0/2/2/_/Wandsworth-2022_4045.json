  "description": "Adjacent to garages - T1 Sycamore: fell as close to ground level as possible also poison to prevent regrowth, no long-term future for tree in its location out growing surrounding area and likely to cause damage to fencing. T2 Neighbours garden x1 sycamore fell as close to ground level as possible poison to prevent re-growth likely to cause damage to clients property. Cause of concern to local residents, is likely to cause damage to adjacent property. T3 neighbours garden x1 sycamore fell as close to ground level as possible poison stump to prevent regrowth. Lack of light into surrounding area, low amenity value. T4 Alley way x1 extra-large sycamore (right hand side of bay) reduce and reshape crown by 30% thin by 20%, this will reduce the risk of branches shedding, crown clean. Part of the maintenance programme maintaining tree at a suitable size for its location, to reduce sail affect in canopy risk of wind throw and branch fractures. T5: Alley way x1 bay fell as close to ground level as possible do not poison. Low amenity value tree, is outgrowing the surrounding area and no long term future for this tree in its current location. T6 Alley way x1 horse chestnut reduce back all branches encroaching onto building and overhanging rood likely to cause damage to clients property if left. (upon site visit I observed a ganoderma fungus bracket at the base of the tree which could potentially cause butt and stem failure in the future, this would have to be regularly inspected and potentially reducing the tree substantially in the future to avoid total failure. Large tree in close proximity to building, likely to cause damage to adjacent property. T7 Front garden x1 horse chestnut reduce and reshape crown by 30% thin by 20%, this will reduce the sail and reduce the risk of tree failure, there is a large rot pocket at base of the tree. Part of the maintenance programme maintaining tree at a suitable size for its location.",
