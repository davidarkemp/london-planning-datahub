    "Reason : 1 - By reason of its scale, design and internal arrangement, the development would provide a poor standard of accommodation through restricted outlook and significant sense of enclosure for future occupiers. The proposal therefore fails to comply with policies D3 and D6 of the London Plan (2021), policies DMS1 and DMH4 of the DMPD (2016), policy LP27 of the of the Wandsworth Publication Version Local Plan (Regulation 19 version) (2022) and the guidance within the Mayor of London's Housing Supplementary Planning Guidance (2016), the Mayor of London Housing Design Quality and Standards SPG (pre-consultation draft) (2022) and the Wandsworth Housing SPD (2016).\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably. In addition further guidance was offered to the applicant by the case officer during the processing of the application to identify amendments to address those elements of the scheme considered unacceptable. However, the necessary amendments to make the application acceptable are substantial and would materially change the development proposal. They would require further consultations to be undertaken prior to determination, which could not take place within the statutory determination period specified by the Department of Communities and Local Government. \r\n"
