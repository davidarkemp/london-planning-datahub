    "Reason : 1 - The development would by reason of its scale and design dominate the appearance of the original building, causing harm to its appearance and to its contribution to the significance of the conservation area, with no public benefits to outweigh this harm. The proposal therefore fails to comply with the National Planning Policy Framework, policies D3 and HC1 of the London Plan, policies DMS1, DMS2 and DMH5 of the Development Management Policies Document, and the Housing supplementary planning document.\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The development would also by reason of its scale, siting and orientation cause unacceptable overlooking of the windows of neighbouring sites and be unacceptably overbearing to the occupiers of neighbouring sites. The proposal therefore fails to comply with the National Planning Policy Framework, policy DMS1 of the Development Management Policies Document and the Housing supplementary planning document.\r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
