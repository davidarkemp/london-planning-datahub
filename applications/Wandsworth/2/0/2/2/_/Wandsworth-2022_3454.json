    "Reason : 1 - The proposed mast and equipment would collectively, by reason of their scale, siting and design, constitute an obtrusive and incongruous addition that would result in an undue adverse impact on the visual amenity of the streetscene, and would adversely impact the use of the pavement. The equipment would constitute a safety hazard in the form of obstruction to the free flow of pedestrians and would result in an obstruction to drivers within this area, resulting in risk to pedestrians and other vulnerable road users in this location.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the proposal fails to provide an acceptable siting and design and raises transport concerns contrary to Part 16 of the GPDO 2015 (as amended), NPPF (2021), the London Plan (2021), Policy IS3 of the Wandsworth Core Strategy (2016) and Policies DMS1, DMS2 and DMS9 of the Development Management Policies Document (2016).\r\n"
