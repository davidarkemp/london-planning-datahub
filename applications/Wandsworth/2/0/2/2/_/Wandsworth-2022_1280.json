  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development, by reason of its siting, scale, layout and form, would be an inappropriate and unduly dominant addition that would relate poorly to the existing pier, creating an unacceptable barrier between the river and the bank, spoiling the open character of this part of the river detrimental to the enjoyment of the public realm and creating an additional obstacle for those enjoying the special recreational and sporting function of this part \r\nof the River Thames. The proposal would fail to preserve or enhance the character, appearance and heritage significance of the Putney Embankment Conservation Area and the setting of the Grade II listed Putney Bridge and would result in harm to an identified local view. The proposal would therefore be contrary to policies PM5; LP1; LP2; LP3 and LP60 of Wandsworth Local Plan Publication (Regulation 19) version which are material considerations \r\nto which the Council affords significant weight at this time; policy PL9 the Core Strategy (adopted March 2016); policies DMS1; DMS2 and DM07 of the Development Management Policies Document (adopted March 2016) and the Local Views SPD (adopted February 2014), coupled with the requirements of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021.",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
