    "Reason : 1 - The proposal constitutes development under the Town and Country Planning Act 1990, and the local planning authority is not satisfied that, based on the drawings submitted as part of the application, this proposal falls within any class of 'permitted development' specified within Schedule 2 to the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).\r\n\r\n\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed development would not comply with the provisions of Schedule 2, Part 1, Class A (j) and (ja) of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended). This is because the extension would be joined to another enlargement that would extend beyond a wall forming a side elevation of the original dwellinghouse, and the total enlargement would have a width greater than half the width of the original dwellinghouse. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, the submitted drawings indicate that the extension extends beyond the site boundary as indicated on the submitted drawings. It therefore fails to fall within Schedule 2, Part 1 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended) as the proposed extension is not development within the curtilage of a dwellinghouse. \r\n\r\n"
