    "Reason : 1 - The development would not be of acceptable siting and appearance, and so prior approval is refused. It would cause less than substantial harm to the character, appearance and significance of the Grade II and Grade II* listed Church Row buildings, and the siting of the equipment would not be possible due to the siting of hoardings on Wandsworth Plain and the layout of the Wandsworth Gyratory removal scheme.  The proposals would therefore fail to accord with the provisions of Part 16 of the GPDO 2015 (as amended), NPPF (2021), the London Plan (2021), Policies IS3 and DM04 of the Core Strategy (2016) and Policies DMS1, DMS2, DMS9 and DM01 of the Development Management Policies Document (2016)."
