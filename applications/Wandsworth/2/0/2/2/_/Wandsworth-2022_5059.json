    "Reason : 1 - The replacement windows from timber to uPVC would have a detrimental impact upon the appearance of the property and would not preserve the character and appearance of the Wandsworth Common Conservation Area. It is considered that the proposal would have an unacceptable impact on the host building, and the wider area. The proposal therefore fails to comply with policies PL1 and IS3 of the Core Strategy (2016), policies DMS1, DMS2 and DMH5 of the Development Management Policies Document (2016), emerging policies LP1, LP3 and LP5 of the Local Plan Publication (Regulation 19) Version (2023), the Supplementary Planning Document: Housing (2016) and guidance within the Wandsworth Common CA Appraisal & Management Strategy. The proposal would also not be supported by paragraph 199-202 of the NPPF (2021).",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably. In addition further guidance was offered to the applicant by the case officer during the processing of the application to identify amendments to address those elements of the scheme considered unacceptable. However, the necessary amendments to make the application acceptable are substantial and would materially change the development proposal. They would require further consultations to be undertaken prior to determination, which could not take place within the statutory determination period specified by the Department of Communities and Local Government. You are therefore encouraged to consider submission of a fresh application incorporating the material amendments set out below which are necessary to make the scheme acceptable. \r\n\r\nRequired amendments:\r\nReplacement of windows with timber frame sash windows, like-for-like in appearance to originals. \r\n\r\n"
