  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The existing property makes a positive contribution to the character and appearance of the Clapham Common Conservation Area and the application has failed to clearly or convincingly demonstrate that the demolition is necessary to achieve public benefits that outweigh the harm from its loss. Furthermore, by reason of its scale, siting and design, the proposed replacement building would appear incongruous, unsympathetic and visually intrusive, which would negatively affect the character and appearance of the Clapham Common Conservation area. The proposal would therefore contravene with Section 72(1) of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990, the NPPF (2023), policy HC1 of the London Plan (2021), and policies LP1, LP3, LP5, and LP7 of the WLP (2023).\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - By reason of its scale, siting and design, the proposed development would result in harm to neighbouring amenities in terms of increased overlooking, increased sense of enclosure and overbearing, loss of outlook, loss of privacy, and loss of daylight/sunlight. The proposal therefore fails to comply with policy LP2 of the Wandsworth Local Plan (2023).",
    "Reason : 3 - By reason for a lack of submitted evidence, the application has failed to demonstrate how the Council's zero-carbon target will be met within the framework of the energy hierarchy, with a minimum on-site reduction of at least 35% beyond current Building Regulation standards. Therefore, the proposal fails to comply with policy LP10 of the Wandsworth Local Plan (2023).\r\n",
    "Reason : 4 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
