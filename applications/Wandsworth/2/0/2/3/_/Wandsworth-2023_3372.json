    "Reason : 1 - The application site is located within Balham Town Centre which is subject to a direction made under article 4(1) of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended), which disallows any assessment under Class MA, Part 3, Schedule 2 of the Order. Therefore, a proposed change of use from Class E to Class C3 requires an application for planning permission under the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended).\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
