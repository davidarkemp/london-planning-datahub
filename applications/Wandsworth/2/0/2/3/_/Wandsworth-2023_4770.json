    "Reason : 1 - The development, by reason of scale, design and siting, would constitute an unneighbourly form of development that would have a particularly harmful impact on the amenity of the neighbouring occupiers to the rear at Simpson Street in the form of loss of privacy, loss of outlook, being overbearing and creating an increased sense of enclosure. Therefore, the proposal would fail to comply with policy LP2 of the Wandsworth Local Plan (2023) and the guidance within the Housing SPD (2016). \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed roof terrace would by reason of scale, design and siting constitute a prominent, unsympathetic and incongruous form of development.  It would relate poorly to, and cause harm to the character and appearance of the existing property and fail to preserve local spatial character. Therefore, the proposal would fail to comply with policies LP1 and LP5  of the Wandsworth Local Plan (2023) and the guidance within the Housign SPD (2016). \r\n\r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
