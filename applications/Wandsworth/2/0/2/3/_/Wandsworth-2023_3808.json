    "Reason : 1 - The application has failed to demonstrate through the provision of sufficient evidence that the subject site has been vacant for a continuous period of at least 3 months immediately prior to the date of the application for prior approval. Therefore, the proposed development fails to comply with Condition MA.1(1)(a) of Part 3, Schedule 2 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed change of use would detrimentally impact the character and sustainability of the conservation area and the character of the surrounding parade. Therefore, the proposed development fails to comply with Condition MA.2(2)(e) of Part 3, Schedule 2 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended) and policies LP1 and LP3 of the Local Plan (2023), HC1 of the London Plan (2021) and the NPPF (2023).\r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - The application has failed to demonstrate that the proposed development would provide acceptable natural light levels for all habitable rooms resulting in harm to the residential amenity of future occupiers. Therefore, the proposed development fails to comply with Condition MA.2(2)(f) of Part 3, Schedule 2 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended) and policy LP27 of the Local Plan (2023).\r\n",
    "Reason : 4 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
