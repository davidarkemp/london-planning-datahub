    "Reason : 1 - The replacement windows and doors would constitute  inappropriate alterations due to the proposed design and materiality being unsympathetic and overly contemporary, which would erode the historic character and appearance of the host dwelling, its positive contribution the streetscape, and therefore causing less than substantial harm to the character and appearance of the building and the heritage significance of the Conservation Area.  \r\nThe proposal therefore fails to comply with policies DMS1 and DMS2 of the Development Management Policies Document (2016), and does not accord with Section 72 (1) of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990, Policy HC1 (C) of the London Plan (2021) and paragraph 199 and 202 of the NPPF (2021).",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
