    "Reason : 1 - The proposed advertisement would by reason of its location and design would result in an incongruous feature within the streetscene and the surrounding area. The proposed advertisement would result in a visually intrusive and unsympathetic feature within the surrounding area, detrimental to the existing character. The proposed signage is therefore contrary to policies LP1 and LP9 of the Wandsworth Local Plan 2023.",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
