    "Reason : 1 - The development would, by reason of its scale and design, constitute an unsympathetic and incongruous form of development that would relate poorly to the host building and adjoining rear residential setting. Accordingly, the proposals fail to conform to policies LP1 and LP5 of the Wandsworth Local Plan (2023), and the guidance within the Housing SPD (2016).\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - By reason of its scale and siting, the proposal would constitute an unneighbourly form of development with potential harm in terms of a loss of outlook and noise disturbance to neighbouring occupiers. Therefore, the proposal fails to conform to policy LP2 of the Wandsworth Local Plan (2023), and the guidance within the Housing SPD (2016).",
    "Reason : 3 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan and Supplementary Planning documents as well as offering a full pre application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably.
