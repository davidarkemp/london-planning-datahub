    "Condition : 1 - The development hereby permitted shall be begun within 3 years from the date of this permission.\r\nReason: To prevent the accumulation of unimplemented planning permissions and to comply with Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended) and to meet the requirements of Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004 and to meet the requirements of The Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015.\r\n",
    "Condition : 2 - The development shall be carried out in accordance with the reports, specifications and drawings detailed [107C; 105] nonwithstanding the annotations shown on drawing 105, which should be excluded from this permission. \r\nReason: To ensure a satisfactory standard of development and to allow the local planning authority to review any potential changes to the scheme. \r\n",
    "Condition : 3 - Prior to occupation of the development the window in the side elevation at second floor level of the development shall be obscure-glazed and non-opening (unless the parts of the window which can be opened are more than 1.7 metres above the floor of the room in which the window is installed).  The window shall so be maintained and retained as such. \r\nReason: To control overlooking and safeguard the privacy of neighbours in accordance with Council policy LP2 of the Wandsworth Local Plan (adopted August 2023) coupled with the requirements of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021.\r\n",
    "Condition : 4 - INFORMATIVE: In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. The Council has made available detailed advice in the form of its statutory policies in the Local Plan (2023) consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning Documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre-application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably.
