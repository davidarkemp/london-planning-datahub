    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development, by reason of its design, location and appearance would be visually incongruous and would fail to satisfactorily relate to the existing and neighbouring properties to the harm of local visual amenity. The proposal would therefore be contrary to the NPPF (2023), policies LP1 and LP5 of the Wandsworth Local Plan (2023) and the Supplementary Planning Document: Housing (2016).",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
