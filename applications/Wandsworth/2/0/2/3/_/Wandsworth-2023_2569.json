    "Reason : 1 - The extension by reason of its design, bulk and siting would be an inappropriate and incongruous addition to the roof of this property, detrimental to the visual amenity, character and appearance of the host building, the group of properties of which it forms part and to the streetscene.\r\nThe proposal therefore fails to comply with Policies LP1, LP2,\r\nand LP5 of the Local Plan (2023), as well as the guidance\r\nset out in the Housing SPD\r\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
