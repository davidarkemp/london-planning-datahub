    "Reason : 1 - The proposed alterations to the main roof and above the back addition, by reason of their style, scale, location and siting, would result in inappropriate and incongruous additions to the subject property that would relate awkwardly to the adjoining properties and cause undue visual harm to the character and appearance of the host property and the surrounding area. The proposal would cause undue harm to the amenity of surrounding residential occupiers in terms of being overbearing, causing unsatisfactory outlook and creating a sense of enclosure. The proposal would therefore fail to be in accordance with policies LP1, LP2, and LP5 of the Wandsworth Local Plan (2023); policy D3 of the London Plan (2021); and the Local Plan SPD 'Housing' (2016). ",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably. In addition further guidance was offered to the applicant by the case officer during the processing of the application to identify amendments to address those elements of the scheme considered unacceptable. However, the necessary amendments to make the application acceptable are substantial and would materially change the development proposal. They would require further consultations to be undertaken prior to determination, which could not take place within the statutory determination period specified by the Department of Communities and Local Government.\r\n"
