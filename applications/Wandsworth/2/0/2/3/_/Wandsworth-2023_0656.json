  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The development by reason of its design, impact on amenity, and layout would result in two units of substandard accommodation which would have inadequate provision of light and amenity space. The proposed extension due to its excessive scale and location would result in undue harm to the amenity of neighbouring occupiers at nos. 156/158 in the form of loss of light, outlook and increased sense of enclosure. The proposal therefore fails to comply with Policies LP1, LP2, LP5, and LP27 of the Local Plan (2023), as well as the Housing SPD (2016). It would also be in contravention of Policies D4 and D6 of the London Plan, and Paragraph 134 of the NPPF (2023). ",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
