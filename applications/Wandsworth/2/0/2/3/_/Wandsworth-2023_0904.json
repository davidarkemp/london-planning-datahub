    "Reason : 1 - The proposal constitutes development under the Town and Country Planning Act 1990, and the local planning authority is not satisfied that, based on the drawings submitted as part of the application, this proposal falls within any class of 'permitted development' specified within Schedule 2 to the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).\r\n\r\nINFORMATIVE: The proposed development would not comply with the provisions of paragraphs A.1(b), A.1(f)(i), A.1(j)(iii) and A.3(a) of Class A of Part 1 of Schedule 2 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 2015. The proposed development would also not comply with the provisions of paragraphs B.1(b), B.2(a) and B.2(b)(bb) of Class B of Part 1 of Schedule 2 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 2015.\r\n\r\nThe proposed single-storey rear/side extension would extend beyond the two-storey back addition by 6 metres and the main dwellinghouse by 11.33 metres; would have a width greater than half the width of the original dwellinghouse; and would have fenestration that fails to match the fenestration of the existing dwellinghouse. Additionally, the proposed single-storey rear/side extension and the existing outbuilding would occupy over 50% of the total area of the curtilage.\r\n\r\nThe proposed additions to the roof of the host property would raise the ridge of the main roof by 400mm; would have fenestration that fails to match the fenestration of the existing dwellinghouse; and would not be set back from the eaves of the main roof by 200mm or more."
