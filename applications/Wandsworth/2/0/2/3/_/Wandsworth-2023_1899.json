    "Condition : 14 - INFORMATIVE: Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL): From the information available, it appears that the development permitted is subject to a Community Infrastructure Levy charge in accordance with the Community Infrastructure Levy Regulations 2010 (as amended) (the \"Regulations\"). \r\nYou or the relevant interested parties are required to provide the Council with the information set out in the Regulations.

As soon as the developer, landowner or other interested party(ies) is aware of the date when development is going to start they must also submit a \"Commencement Notice\".  Failure to comply with the Regulations, including failure to complete the forms when required or providing inaccurate information can lead to surcharges or other penalties as set out in the Regulations. It can also mean that any exemptions or reliefs are lost.\r\nGeneral information on the Community Infrastructure Levy, including the forms mentioned above can be found on the Planning Portal (www.planningportal.gov.uk). Details of the Mayoral CIL can be found on the GLA and TfL websites (www.london.gov.uk and www.tfl.gov.uk).

    "Condition : 15 - INFORMATIVE: Any assessment of CIL liability by the Council has been based on the information provided. The assessment of CIL liability referred to in this informative is indicative only and is not intended to provide a binding estimate of the actual CIL liability likely to be incurred.  The assessment of the actual CIL liability will be provided pursuant to and in accordance with the Community Infrastructure Levy Regulations 2010 (as amended).  Where the calculation of CIL liability includes taking account of the existing use of a building, CIL liability may change if the information provided in relation to the existing use(s) of buildings, is not still current at the time of the decision which first permits development.",
    "Condition : 16 - INFORMATIVES from Thames Water: \r\n\r\nWaste Comments:\r\nWe would expect the developer to demonstrate what measures will be undertaken to minimise groundwater discharges into the public sewer.  Groundwater discharges typically result from construction site dewatering, deep excavations, basement infiltration, borehole installation, testing and site remediation.  Any discharge made without a permit is deemed illegal and may result in prosecution under the provisions of the Water Industry Act 1991. Should the Local Planning Authority be minded to approve the planning application, Thames Water would like the following informative attached to the planning permission: \"A Groundwater Risk Management Permit from Thames Water will be required for discharging groundwater into a public sewer.  Any discharge made without a permit is deemed illegal and may result in prosecution under the provisions of the Water Industry Act 1991.  We would expect the developer to demonstrate what measures he will undertake to minimise groundwater discharges into the public sewer.  Permit enquiries should be directed to Thames Water's Risk Management Team by telephoning 020 3577 9483 or by emailing trade.effluent@thameswater.co.uk .  Application forms should be completed on line via http://www.thameswater.co.uk/.  Please refer to the Wholsesale; Business customers; Groundwater discharges section.\r\n\r\nWith regard to SURFACE WATER drainage, Thames Water would advise that if the developer follows the sequential approach to the disposal of surface water we would have no objection.  Management of surface water from new developments should follow Policy SI 13 Sustainable drainage of the London Plan 2021.  Where the developer proposes to discharge to a public sewer, prior approval from Thames Water Developer Services will be required.  Should you require further information please refer to our website. https://www.thameswater.co.uk/developers/larger-scale-developments/planning-your-development/working-near-o"
