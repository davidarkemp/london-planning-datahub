    "Reason : 1 - The proposed hardstanding and vehicle crossover, would by reason of its scale and design would result in less than substantial harm to the character and appearance of the Dover House Estate Conservation Area due to its stark, unwelcoming, dominating appearance within the terrace and the loss of the uniform hedge within the street and without any public benefits to outweigh the harm. The proposal fails to meet the requirements of paragraph 202 of the NPPF (2023) and policies LP1, LP2, LP3 and LP5 of Wandsworth's Local Plan (July 2023).",

No assessment has been made in relation to the indicative ground floor extension shown on the plans. For the aviodance of doubt, this does not form part of the application ",
