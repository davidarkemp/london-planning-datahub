    "Reason : 1 - The roller shutter by reason of its design results in an unsympathetic and inappropriate addition to the shopfront. The impermeable shutter design lacks visual interest and fails to facilitate the establishment of an active frontage with visual interaction between the property and the public realm. The development therefore results in harm to the character and appearance of the host building, neighbouring group and the wider streetscape, contrary to current policies DMS1 and DMTS9 of the DMPD (2016), policies LP1 and LP8 of the PVLP (2023), and the guidance within the Shopfronts SPD (1988). ",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
