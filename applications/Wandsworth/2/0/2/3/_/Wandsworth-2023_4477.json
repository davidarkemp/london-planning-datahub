    "Reason : 1 - By reason of the scale, design and siting of the proposed car-port structure, it is considered that the proposed addition would appear as an incongruous and jarring addition that would fail to maintain subservience to the existing property, obscure some of the original features of the property and reduce the symmetry of the terrace. The proposed structure would therefore cause harm to the character and appearance of the application property and the wider conservation area, with no public benefits that would outweigh this harm, contrary to Local Plan Policies LP1, LP2, LP3 and LP5, London Plan Policy HC1, the NPPF and the Councils Housing SPD.",
    "Reason : 2 - By reason of the scale, design and siting of the proposed rear dormer roof extension it is considered that it would be of scale and design that would fail to maintain subservience to the existing property, appearing as a dominant and incongruous feature that would cause harm to the character and appearance of the application property, wider terrace and wider conservation area. There are no public benefits that would outweigh this harm, contrary to Local Plan Policies LP1, LP2, LP3 and LP5, London Plan Policy HC1, the NPPF and the Councils Housing SPD.",
    "Reason : 3 - By reason of their design and materiality, the proposed replacement windows would be inappropriate in the context of this property which was originally fitted with Crittall steel-framed casement windows with Georgian glazing bars. The proposed replacement windows would therefore fail to preserve or enhance the character or appearance of the conservation area, contrary to Local Plan Policy LP3 and London Plan Policy HC1. ",
    "Reason : 4 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
