  "description": "Rear garden: We would like to fell a eucalyptus tree which was planted by the former owners of our house and has become overgrown and unmanageable. It is now pushing the fence line with our neighbours in number 17. It endless drops branches, leaves and bark - on both sides of the fence - and also provides excessive shade. I'm also informed that eucalyptus trees can drop large branches without warning, which is a concern for my children who play below it. We replaced the broken boundary fence, and our neigbour kindly agreed for us to go around the tree - onto her land - however i would like to be able to return the fence and boundary to where it should be. Many thanks.",
