    "Reason : 1 - The proposal constitutes development under the Town and Country Planning Act 1990, and the local planning authority is not satisfied that, based on the drawings submitted as part of the application, this proposal falls within any class of 'permitted development' specified within Schedule 2 to the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).\r\nINFORMATIVE: The proposed development would not constitute as permitted development under Class A of Part 16 of Schedule 2 of the General Permitted Development Order 2015 (as amended). This is because the proposed replacement antennas would be installed on a Grade II* listed building and also would be situated higher than 15 metres above ground level."
