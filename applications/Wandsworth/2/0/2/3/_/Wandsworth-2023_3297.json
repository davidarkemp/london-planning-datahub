    "Reason : 1 - The removal of the chimney stacks would amend the operative part of planning permission 2023/1371 contrary to the provisions of the National Planning Practice Guidance.",
    "Reason : 2 - The removal of the chimney stacks would cause harm to the appearance of the host building and character and significance of Oxford Road Conservation Area, without there being public benefits to outweigh this harm, contrary to the provisions of Local Plan (2023) policies LP1, LP2, LP3 and LP5 and paragraphs 197 and 202 National Planning Policy Framework (2023).  ",
    "Reason : 3 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
