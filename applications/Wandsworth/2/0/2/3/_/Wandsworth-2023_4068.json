    "Reason : 1 - The proposed roof extensions and two-storey side extension by reason of its siting, scale, massing, bulk and design would be harmful to the character and appearance of this property and to the visual amenities of the surrounding area. It would result in a highly visible and overly-dominant development that poorly relates to the host property and surrounding area.. The proposal therefore fails to comply with policies LP1 and LP5 of the Wandsworth Local Plan (2023), and the Wandsworth Housing SPD (2016).",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
