    "Condition : 1 - 13. No development shall take place until a detailed method statement for the remediation works (to include all works to be undertaken, proposed remediation objectives and remediation criteria, timetable of works and site management procedures) to make the site suitable for its intended use shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority.  Prior to the first beneficial occupation of the development any remediation works will have been completed and a validation report to verify these works must be submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority.  If, during development, further contamination not previously identified is found to be present at the site the local planning authority is to be informed immediately and no further development shall be carried out until a report indicating the nature of the contamination and how it is to be remediated is submitted to and agreed in writing by the local planning authority, and any required remediation shall be detailed and verified as an amendment to the remediation statement and carried out accordingly.  \r\n\r\nReason: To ensure that risks from land contamination to the future users of the land and neighbouring land are minimised, together with those to controlled waters, property and ecological systems, and to ensure that the development can be carried out safely without unacceptable risks to workers, neighbours and other off-site receptors, having regard to Council policies IS4 and DMH4 of the Development Management Policies Document (adopted March 2016) coupled with the requirements of the National Planning Policy Framework 2019. The details are required prior to the start of the works so that the necessary precautions and mitigation measures can be incorporated into the excavation and construction.\r\n\r\n"
