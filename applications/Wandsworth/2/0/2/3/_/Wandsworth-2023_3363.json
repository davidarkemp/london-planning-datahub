    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development, due to the form of the proposed front roof extension, would result in an existing uncharacteristic roof feature being replaced with a further unsympathetic and unduly prominent form of front roof extension, that would be harmful to the appearance of the host property, and to the character and setting of this part of the Wandsworth Common Conservation Area. The development would therefore be contrary to policies LP1, LP3 and LP5 of the local plan (2023); the 'Housing' SPD (2016) and also in contravention of Section 72 (1) of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990, Policy HC1 (C) of the London Plan (2021) and paragraphs 212 and 215 of the NPPF (2024).",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably. In addition further guidance was offered to the applicant by the case officer during the processing of the application to identify amendments to address those elements of the scheme considered unacceptable. However, the necessary amendments to make the application acceptable are substantial and would materially change the development proposal. They would require further consultations to be undertaken prior to determination, which could not take place within the statutory determination period specified by the Department of Communities and Local Government. You are therefore encouraged to consider submission of a fresh application incorporating the material amendments set out below which are necessary to make the scheme acceptable. \r\n\r\nRequired amendments:\r\nRe-instate pitched roof to front roofslope with dormers set within this. \r\n"
