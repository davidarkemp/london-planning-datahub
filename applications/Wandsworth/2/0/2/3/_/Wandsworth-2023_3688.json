The plant shall not be used unless the equipment is installed in compliance with these details. The plant shall be serviced regularly in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions and as necessary to ensure that the requirements of the condition are maintained. The accompanying odour mitigation systems shall be installed in accordance with approved plans/reports/details. If at any time the plant is determined by the local planning authority to be failing to comply with this condition, it shall be switched off upon written instruction from the local planning authority and not used again until it is able to comply.\r\nReason: To protect the amenities of neighbouring occupiers, in accordance with policy LP2 of the Local Plan (2023).

    "Condition : 8 - The proposed flue shall be mounted only to the mortar of the building ensuring bricks are left intact. \r\nReason: To protect the heritage of the building and the conservation area in accordance with Policies LP1 and LP3 of the Local Plan (2023).\r\n\r\n"
