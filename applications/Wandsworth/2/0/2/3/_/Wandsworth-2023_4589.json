The focus should be on manual or mechanical weed removal methodologies, unless there is a specific reason to use chemicals such as occasions where certain noxious or invasive plants must be controlled or eradicated using chemicals, such as Giant Hogweed or Japanese Knotweed, but this should involve targeted or highly selective methods of applying herbicides such as stem injection or leaf wiping.",

    "Condition : 35 - Network Rail Informative: \r\nThe developer must ensure that their proposal, both during construction and after completion does not undertake the following without consent in writing from Network Rail for alternative proposals.\r\n\r\nThe developer must ensure that their proposal, both during construction and after completion does not:\r\n- encroach onto Network Rail land\r\n- affect the safety, operation or integrity of the company's railway and its infrastructure\r\n- undermine its support zone\r\n- damage the company's infrastructure\r\n- place additional load on cuttings\r\n- adversely affect any railway land or structure\r\n- over-sail or encroach upon the air-space of any Network Rail land\r\n- cause to obstruct or interfere with any works or proposed works or Network \r\nRail development both now and in the future\r\nNetwork Rail strongly recommends the developer complies with the following comments and requirements to maintain the safe operation of the railway and protect Network Rail's infrastructure.\r\n",
    "Condition : 36 - Network Rail Informative: \r\n\r\nThe developer must ensure that their proposal, both during construction and after completion does not undertake the following without consent in writing from Network Rail for alternative proposals.\r\n\r\nThe applicant must ensure that any construction and subsequent maintenance can be carried out to any proposed buildings or structures without adversely affecting the safety of/or encroaching upon Network Rail's adjacent land and air-space. Therefore, any buildings are required to be situated at least 2 metres (3m for overhead lines and third rail) from Network Rail's boundary. \r\nThis requirement will allow for the construction and future maintenance of a building without the need to access the operational railway environment. Any less than 2m (3m for overhead lines and third rail) and there is a strong possibility that the applicant (and any future resident) will need to utilise Network Rail land and air-space to facilitate works as well as adversely impact upon Network Rail's maintenance teams' ability to maintain our boundary fencing and boundary treatments. Access to Network Rail's land may not always be granted and if granted may be subject to railway site safety requirements and special provisions with all associated railway costs charged to the applicant. \r\nAs mentioned above, any works within Network Rail's land would need approval from the Network Rail Asset Protection Engineer. This request should be submitted at least 20 weeks before any works are due to commence on site and the applicant is liable for all associated costs (e.g. all possession, site safety, asset protection presence costs). However, Network Rail is not required to grant permission for any third-party access to its land.\r\n",
    "Condition : 37 - Network Rail Informative:\r\nThe developer must ensure that their proposal, both during construction and after completion does not undertake the following without consent in writing from Network Rail for alternative proposals.\r\n\r\nPlant & Materials \r\nAll operations, including the use of cranes or other mechanical plant working adjacent to Network Rail's property, must at all times be carried out in a \"fail safe\" manner such that in the event of mishandling, collapse or failure, no plant or materials are capable of falling within 3.0m of the boundary with Network Rail. \r\nDrainage \r\nStorm/surface water must not be discharged onto Network Rail's property or into Network Rail's culverts or drains except by agreement with Network Rail. Suitable drainage or other works must be provided and maintained by the Developer to prevent surface water flows or run-off onto Network Rail's property. Proper provision must be made to accept and continue drainage discharging from Network Rail's property; full details to be submitted for approval to the Network Rail Asset Protection Engineer. Suitable foul drainage must be provided separate from Network Rail's existing drainage. Soakaways, as a means of storm/surface water disposal must not be constructed within 20 metres of Network Rail's boundary or at any point which could adversely affect the stability of Network Rail's property. After the completion and occupation of the development, any new or exacerbated problems attributable to the new development shall be investigated and remedied at the applicants' expense.\r\nScaffolding \r\nAny scaffold which is to be constructed within 10 metres of the railway boundary fence must be erected in such a manner that at no time will any poles over-sail the railway and protective netting around such scaffold must be installed. The applicant/applicant's contractor must consider if they can undertake the works and associated scaffold/access for working at height within the footprint of their property bound",
