    "Reason : 1 - The development which includes a roof terrace, by reason of its scale and location, would appear as an incongruant and overly dominant addition at roof level, harming the appearance and character of the building and when viewed in the context of the wider roofline of the terrace.  It would also cause undue sense of overbearing and overshadowing of nearby windows affecting the living conitions of neighbouring residents. \r\nThe proposal therefore fails to comply with policies IS3, DMS1 and DMH5 of the Development Management Policies Document (2016), and the Housing SPD.\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
