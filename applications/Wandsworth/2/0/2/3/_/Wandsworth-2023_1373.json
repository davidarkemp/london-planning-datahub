    "Reason : 1 - The development, by reason of its scale, bulk, and design, would constitute an unsympathetic and incongruous form of development in a visually prominent location that would fail to integrate successfully with the host property. The proposed extension would relate poorly to, and cause harm to, the local spatial character of the location. The development is therefore fails to comply with the NPPF (2021), the London Plan (2021), Wandsworth's Core Strategy (2016) policies PL1 and IS3, Wandsworth's DMPD (2016) policies DMS1 and DMH5 and emerging policies LP1 and LP5 of the Local Plan Publication (Regulation 19) version with modifications (PVLP) (2023)\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed development by reason of its design, scale, height and location would be an unneighbourly form of development that would have a detrimental impact on the amenity of neighbouring properties in the form of loss outlook, being overbearing, creating an increased sense of enclosure and overlooking. The proposal would therefore be contrary to policy DMS1 of the Development Management Policies Document (2016) and policy LP2 of the Local Plan Publication (Regulation 19) version with modifications (PVLP) (2023).",
    "Reason : 3 - The development, by reason of poor levels of outlook and inadequate Gross Internal Area would result in an unacceptable standard of accommodation for future occupiers. The development would fail to comply with Technical Housing Standards - Nationally Described Space Standard 2015, DMPD (2016) policies DMH4 and DMH6 and Local Plan Publication (Regulation 19) version with modifications (PVLP) (2023) policy LP27.",
    "Reason : 4 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the design of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
