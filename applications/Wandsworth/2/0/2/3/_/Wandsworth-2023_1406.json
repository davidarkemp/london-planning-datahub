    "Reason : 1 - The proposed safety netting, by reason of its scale, material, and location, would be an inappropriate addition that would cause undue harm to the character and appearance of the site, streetscene and heritage significance of the Wandsworth Common Conservation Area. It would also negatively impact the biodiversity of the area, threatening the passage of flying animals. The proposal would therefore be contrary to policies IS3, IS2, & IS3 of the Core Strategy (March 2016); DMS1, DMS3, DMO1, DMO2, and DMO4 of the Development Management Policies Document (March 2016) and the Housing SPD (November 2016); as well as policies LP1, LP2, LP3, LP53, LP54, LP55; coupled with the requirements of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021.\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
