    "Reason : 1 - The development would by reason of its inappropriate scale and design would result in creating further disparity between the semi-detached pair, further eroding their symmetry, would create a terrace effect as a result of in-filling the spaces between the two buildings and would result in unjustified harm to the property and character and apperance of the conservation area\r\nThe proposal therefore fails to comply with policies LP1, LP2, LP3 and LP5 of the Wandsworth Local Plan (July 2023), and Housing SPD.\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
