    "Reason : 1 - The dwellings on the basement and ground floor levels would afford future occupiers with a poor standard of accommodation in terms of outlook, daylight penetration and natural ventilation contrary to the provisions of Local Plan (2023) policy LP27 and the Mayors Housing Standards LPG (2023).  ",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan as well as offering a full pre-application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably. In addition further guidance was offered to the applicant by the case officer during the processing of the application to identify amendments to address those elements of the scheme considered unacceptable. However, the necessary amendments to make the application acceptable are substantial and would materially change the development proposal. They would require further consultations to be undertaken prior to determination, which could not take place within the statutory determination period specified by the Department of Communities and Local Government. You are therefore encouraged to consider submission of a fresh application incorporating the material amendments set out below which are necessary to make the scheme acceptable. \r\n\r\nRequired amendments:\r\n- Remove the residential floorspace from the basement level. \r\n-Ensure the ground level lightwell is not shared between dwellings.\r\n\r\n"
