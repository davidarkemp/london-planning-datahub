    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development would convert a suitable family dwelling of less than 130sqm floorspace (as originally constructed) into flats and, as such, would result in harm to the housing mix of the borough and fail to comply with policy LP26 of the Local Plan (2023).",
    "Reason : 2 - The applicant has failed to demonstrate that the upper floor flats would achieve adequate floorspace and for the upper most flat adequate floor to ceiling height. In addition, insufficient internal storage provision has been provided for all three flats. As such, the proposed development would result in an unacceptably poor standard of accommodation and living environment for the future occupiers. The proposal would be contrary to policies LP27 of the Wandsworth Local Plan (2023) and the Technical Housing Standards - Nationally Described Space Standard (2015). ",
    "Reason : 3 - No details have been provided in relation to proposed cycle storage. As such the proposed development would not provide sufficient cycle storage for future occupiers to the harm of sustainable transport objectives. The development would therefore fail to comply with Policy LP51 of the Wandsworth Local Plan (2023).",
    "Reason : 4 - The Fire Safety Strategy does not provide sufficient detail as to how the development would ensure that it is constructed in an appropriate way to minimise the risk of fire spread. Therefore, the development fails to comply with Policy D12 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "Reason : 5 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan (2023) as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
