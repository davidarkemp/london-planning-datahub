    "Reason : 1 - The proposal by reason of its siting, scale, massing, bulk and design would result in a highly visible, incongruous and over-dominant addition, which would relate poorly to the host and neighbouring properties to the harm of the character and appearance of the local area. The proposal would be contrary to policies DMS1 and DMH5 of the Development Management Policies Document (2016), policies LP1 (The Design-led Approach) and LP5 (Residential Extensions and Alterations) of the Local Plan Publication (Regulation 19) version with modifications (2023), the guidance within the Housing Supplementary Planning Document (2016) and the NPPF (2021).",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably. In addition further guidance was offered to the applicant by the case officer during the processing of the application to identify amendments to address those elements of the scheme considered unacceptable. However, the necessary amendments to make the application acceptable are substantial and would materially change the development proposal. They would require further consultations to be undertaken prior to determination, which could not take place within the statutory determination period specified by the Department of Communities and Local Government. You are therefore encouraged to consider submission of a fresh application incorporating the material amendments set out below which are necessary to make the scheme acceptable. \r\n\r\nRequired amendments:\r\nRemoval of flat roof first floor element of the side extension.\r\n"
