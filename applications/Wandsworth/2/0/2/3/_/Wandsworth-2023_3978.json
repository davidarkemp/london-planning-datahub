    "Condition : 12 - INFORMATIVE: Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL): From the information available, it appears that the development permitted is subject to a Community Infrastructure Levy charge in accordance with the Community Infrastructure Levy Regulations 2010 (as amended) (the \"Regulations\"). \r\nYou or the relevant interested parties are required to provide the Council with the information set out in the Regulations. This process for the collection of CIL includes:  the requirement to complete an \"Assumption of Liability\" form as soon as possible;  in order to claim charitable exemption, social housing relief or other forms of relief you or the relevant interested party should also complete the relevant \"Claiming Exemption or Relief\" form which must also be granted before commencement of the development to be valid. \r\nThe Council will, if appropriate, then issue a Liability Notice(s) which details the charges due. As soon as the developer, landowner or other interested party(ies) is aware of the date when development is going to start they must also submit a \"Commencement Notice\".  Failure to comply with the Regulations, including failure to complete the forms when required or providing inaccurate information can lead to surcharges or other penalties as set out in the Regulations. It can also mean that any exemptions or reliefs are lost.\r\nGeneral information on the Community Infrastructure Levy, including the forms mentioned above can be found on the Planning Portal (www.planningportal.gov.uk). Details of the Mayoral CIL can be found on the GLA and TfL websites (www.london.gov.uk and www.tfl.gov.uk).

    "Condition : 13 - INFORMATIVE: Any assessment of CIL liability by the Council has been based on the information provided. The assessment of CIL liability referred to in this informative is indicative only and is not intended to provide a binding estimate of the actual CIL liability likely to be incurred.  The assessment of the actual CIL liability will be provided pursuant to and in accordance with the Community Infrastructure Levy Regulations 2010 (as amended).  Where the calculation of CIL liability includes taking account of the existing use of a building, CIL liability may change if the information provided in relation to the existing use(s) of buildings, is not still current at the time at which planning permission first permits development, as defined in the Regulations."
