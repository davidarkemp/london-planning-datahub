    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development, by reason of its scale, design and siting, would represent an inappropriate, unsympathetic and dominant form of development within the streetscene that would result in harm upon the character and appearance of the Streatham Park Conservation Area. The proposal is therefore contrary to the guidance of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023), section 72 (1) of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990, HC1 of the London Plan (2021) and Policies LP1 and LP3 of the Wandsworth Local Plan (2023), the SPD 'Housing' (2016) and Streatham Park Conservation Area Appraisal and Management Strategy\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed development, by reason of its scale, design and siting, in conjunction with the existing substiantial 1 Clairview Road extension, would result in an unneighbourly, intrusive and overbearing form of development to the harm of neighbour amenity at 2 Clairview Road, contrary to policy LP2 of the Wandsworth Local Plan (2023).",
    "Reason : 3 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
