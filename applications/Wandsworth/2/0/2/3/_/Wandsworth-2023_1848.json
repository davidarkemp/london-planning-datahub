    "Reason : 1 - The proposed rear dormer, by reason of the scale, appearance and location would provide an incongruous, discordant and overly dominant addition to the property which would unduly detract from the character of the host building, the local spatial character and the Wandsworth Common Conservation Area. The proposal therefore fails to comply with policies LP1, LP3 and LP5 of the Wandsworth Local Plan (2023), the Wandsworth Housing SPD (2016), the NPPF (2021) and Section 72(1) of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas).\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan (2023) as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the design of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
