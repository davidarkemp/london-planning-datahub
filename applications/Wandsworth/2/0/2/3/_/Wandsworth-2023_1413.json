  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - 1.\tThe increased height by an additional storey over Block 2 and part of Block 3 would result in the proposal's unacceptable size and massing presenting a built form that would be detrimental to the spatial character of the location. The increased number of one bedroom, two-person units does not meet the borough-wide housing mix which has been informed by the Council's Local Housing Need Assessment (2020) and would produce an excessive and unacceptable oversupply of one bedroom units having considered the matter in Local Plan Policy LP24 (Housing Mix).  The reduction in the quantum of floor area for the provision of commercial, business and service Class E uses (excluding Class E(f) (day nursery, creche or day centre) uses) has been caused by the increase in residential floor area and resultant unacceptable housing mix with an oversupply of one bedroom, two person units, thus reducing the opportunities for an enhanced commercial unit when compare to that approved under Ref.2022/1694 dated 08/03/2023 . As such, the proposal does not meet the objectives of the Wandsworth Local Plan (July 2023) in failing to accord with Policies LP1 (The Design-led Approach) LP2 (General Development Principles), LP4 (Tall and Mid-rise Buildings) and LP24 (Housing Mix) and the NPPF 2023. ",
    "Reason : 2 - 2.\tIn the absence of a completed S.106 planning obligation, to cover but not limited to affordable housing provision and Options 1 and 2 including early and late stage review mechanisms, construction management plan, construction and design of wheelchair units in agreement with Housing Occupational Health Therapist, provision of two disabled bays with EVCP, waste vehicle collection arrangements and consents, highways improvements including exclusion from the controlled parking zone, local employment contribution and agreement, carbon offset payment, energy  'be seen' monitoring and associated s.106 monitoring fees, the proposal fails to meet the objectives of the Wandsworth Planning Obligations Supplementary Planning Document (2020) and Policy LP62 of the Wandsworth Local Plan (July 2023) and the NPPF 2023.",
    "Reason : 3 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service."
