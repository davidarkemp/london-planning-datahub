    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development, by reason of the reduction in floor area for the existing first floor flat and the failure of the second floor flat to meet minimum internal floor space standards would result in a substandard and cramped level of accommodation for future occupiers. Accordingly, the proposal fails to conform to policy LP27 of the Wandsworth Local Plan (2023), policy D6 of the London Plan (2021) and the Technical housing standards- nationally described space standard 2015.",
    "Reason : 2 - INFORMATIVE: Officers note that the 'as-built' rear roof extension and extension over the back addition as constructed differs to that shown on the submitted drawings and therefore the existing constructed extensions do not form part of the planning application. You are advised that the constructed extensions could be liable to further enforcement action if not corrected or regularised.",
    "Reason : 3 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan and Supplementary Planning documents as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
