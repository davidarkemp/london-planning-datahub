    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development by reason of its siting, scale, massing, bulk and design would result in an over-dominant and incongruous addition, which would relate poorly to the locally listed building. The proposal would result in less than substantial harm to the character and appearance of the host property and the Battersea Park Conservation Area whilst failing to provide public benefit that would outweigh the harm identified. The proposal would be contrary to policies LP1 and LP3 of the Local Plan (2023), and the Battersea Park Conservation Area Appraisal and Management Strategy (2008) as well as the NPPF (2023).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed development by reason of its scale, design and proximity to the boundary with the neighbouring properties would be an unneighbourly form of development that would result in harm to amenity adjoining occupiers by being intrusive, overbearing and resulting in harmful loss of privacy/overlooking and noise and disturbance. The submitted information has also failed to demonstrate that there would not be unacceptable harm to neighbouring windows and gardens in respect to reductions in daylight and sunlight. The proposal fails to comply with policies LP2, LP14 and LP45 of the Local Plan (2023).",
    "Reason : 3 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
