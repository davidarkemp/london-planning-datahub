    "Reason : 1 - The development would, by reason of its style, materiality, location, and overall form.cause significant harm to both the architectural integrity of the host property as well as the heritage significance of the conservation area.  \r\nThe proposal therefore fails to comply with policies  DMS1 and DMS2 of the Development Management Policies Document (2016), and policies LP1 and LP3 of the draft local plan. It also fails to accord with Section 72 (1) of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990, Policy HC1 (C) of the London Plan (2021) and paragraph 199 of the NPPF (2021).",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
