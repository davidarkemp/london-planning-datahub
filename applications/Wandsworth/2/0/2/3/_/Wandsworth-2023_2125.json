    "Reason : 1 - The proposed extension of opening hours would likely result in neighbouring occupiers experiencing a greater degree of disturbance for a longer period during a time when they could expect reasonable peace and quiet. The extended opening hours would therefore be significantly detrimental to the living conditions of neighbouring residential occupiers. As such, the proposal would be contrary to the NPPF (2021), Policy D14 of the London Plan (2021) and Policy LP2 of Wandsworth Local Plan (2023).\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan (2023) as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
