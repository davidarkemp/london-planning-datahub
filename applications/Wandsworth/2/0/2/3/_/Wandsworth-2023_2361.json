    "Reason : 1 - The additional boundary treatment, by reason of its excessive height, design and prominent location would result in a visually conspicuous and discordant addition to the harm of local spatial character and appearance of the streetscene.  The proposal therefore fails to comply with policies LP1 and LP5 of the Wandsworth Local Plan 2023, and guidance within the Housing SPD (2016). \r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
