    "Condition : 2 - INFORMATIVE: You are reminded that this certificate is issued on the basis of the physical circumstances prevailing at the property when the application was made. If any other extension is undertaken BEFORE the construction of the extension, then this certificate would no longer be applicable and planning permission may be required for the development presently proposed.\r\n",
