    "Reason : 1 - The development by reason of it is appearance, scale and siting represents a visually obtrusive and incongruous addition that relates poorly to the host building and is out of place with the prevailing character of shopfronts within the street. It would therefore result in harm of local visual amenity and the character and appearance of the Heaver Estate Conservation Area, contrary to policies LP1, LP3 and LP8 of the Wandsworth Local Plan (2023) and the Shopfronts SPG (1988).",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
