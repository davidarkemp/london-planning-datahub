    "Condition : 4 - No development shall take place until details and samples of materials proposed to be used on all external surfaces of the development have been submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority. The development shall be carried out in accordance with the approved materials and thereafter so retained. \r\nReason: In order to assess the suitability of the proposed materials, in the interests of the appearance of the locality, in accordance with Council policy DMS1 of the Development Management Policies Document (adopted March 2016) coupled with the requirements of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021.  It is necessary for the condition to be discharged prior to the commencement of works to ensure suitable materials are used in the construction.\r\n",
    "Condition : 5 - No development shall commence until a Construction and Environmental Management Plan (CEMP) has been submitted to and been approved in writing by the local planning authority. The CEMP shall include measures to mitigate the construction effects as part of a coordinated and collaborative approach with surrounding developments, and shall include the following details (although not limited to): \r\n\r\na.\tThat development will only take place between the months of October and March with some enabling and completion works permittable during September and April, in order to prevent harm or disturbance to a summer bat roost within No. 78.  \r\nb.\tDetails of a precautionary bat mitigation plan, including (but not limited too) timings of works, bat toolbox talks and a named CIEEM accredited ecologist to contact in case a bat is found on site;\r\nc.\tDetails of a construction lighting plan outlining how lighting will be prevented from negatively impacting any onsite habitats and protected and priority species during construction, in particular roosting, foraging and commuting bats. This construction lighting plan should follow the best practice industry guidance outlined in the Bat Conservation Trust (BCT) and Institute of Lighting Professionals (ILP) Artificial Lighting Guidance;\r\nd.\tIf any works to trees become necessary, these should take place outside of the nesting season (February - September), or if works are unavoidable during this period, then a site walk over at least 48 hours prior to works commencing is required by a named CIEEM accredited ecologist with experience of working in London to check for any nesting birds. In the event that a nest is found, an appropriate exclusion zone should be implemented around it until the young have fully fledged (Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 (as amended)). The law protects all wild bird species, their eggs and nests; \r\ne.\tDetails of measures to prevent mammal, amphibian or reptile entrapment or harm on site;\r\nf.\tDetails of measures ",
