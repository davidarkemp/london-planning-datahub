  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed telecommunications mast and associated equipment would by reason of its siting and appearance be of an overly dominant and visually intrusive scale and design, resulting in undue and excessive clutter in the open streetscene, harming the visual amenities and spatial character of the locality, and the setting of the Wandsworth Common Conservation Area and openness of the Metropolitan Open Land (Clapham Common). The proposal would not meet with the relevant conditions attached to the Class A of Part 16 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order and would be contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Section 72(1) of the Planning (Listed Building and Conservation Areas) Act 1990, policies SI6 and G3 of the London Plan (2021), policy IS3 of the Wandsworth Core Strategy (2016), policies DMS1, DMS2, DMO1 and DMS9 of the Wandsworth Development Management Policies Document (2016) and policies LP1, LP3, LP22 and LP53 of the Local Plan Publication (Regulation 19) version with modifications (PVLP) (2023).",
    "Reason : 2 - The application has failed to demonstrate that the proposed telecommunications mast and associated equipment would not, by reason of its siting and scale, create an unnecessary obstruction of the public space, which could hinder the convenient and safe passage of pedestrians and cyclists, given the demands placed on it. The proposal would therefore not meet with the relevant conditions attached to the Class A of Part 16 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order and would be contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policies T1 and ST4 of the London Plan (2021), policy IS3 of the Wandsworth Core Strategy (2016), policies DMS1, DMS9 and DMT1 of the Wandsworth Development Management Policies Document (2016) and policies LP1, LP22 and LP50 of the Local Plan Publication (Regulation 19) version with modifications (PVLP) (2023).",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed telecommunications mast and associated equipment would, by reason of their scale and siting, result in harm to the health of the existing nearby street trees during installation and impede their future growth and maintenance. The proposal would fail to be of sound arboricultural practice and therefore be contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021) and policy DMO5 of the Wandsworth Development Management Policies Document (2016). It would also fail to comply with policy LP56 of the Local Plan Publication (Regulation 19) version with modifications (PVLP) (2023).",
    "Reason : 4 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
