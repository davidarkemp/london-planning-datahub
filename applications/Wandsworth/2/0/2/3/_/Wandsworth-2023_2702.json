    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development by reason of its scale, bulk and design, would constitute an unsympathetic and incongruous form of development in a prominent location. It would relate poorly to, and cause harm to the neighbouring properties, and fail to preserve the character and appearance of the Nightingale Lane Conservation Area. The proposal therefore fails to comply with policies LP1, LP3 and LP5 of the Wandsworth Local Plan 2023 and guidence within the Housing SPD 2016. \r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed development, by reason of its scale, design and siting constitutes an unneighbourly form of development that harms the amenity of the neighbouring property in the form of loss outlook, being overbearing and creating an increased sense of enclosure.  The development is therefore contrary to policy LP2 of the Local Plan (2023) and the Housing SPD (2016).",
    "Reason : 3 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
