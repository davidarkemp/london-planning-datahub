    "Reason : 1 - By reason of its size and design, the proposed ground floor flat would afford future occupiers with a poor standard of accommodation in terms of outlook, daylight penetration and amenity space. Furthermore, the proposed dwelling would fail to meet minimum floorspace requirements as it would have a total floorspace of less than 37sq.m. and the application has failed to demonstrate that sufficient internal floor to ceiling height would be achieved. As such, the development fails the requirements of policy LP27 of the Wandsworth Local Plan (2023), policy D6 of the London Plan (2021) and the Nationally Described Space Standards (2015). ",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
