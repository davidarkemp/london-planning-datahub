    "Reason : 1 - The proposed rear extension at first floor level, by reason of its style, scale, location and siting would be an inappropriate, incongruous and visually intrusive addition to the original dwellinghouse. Therefore, the proposed development would fail to preserve the architectural significance of the terrace and would cause harm to the special character and appearance of the host property and the Dover House Estate Conservation Area. Regarding residential amenity, the proposed development would likely create a sense of enclosure and cause unsatisfactory outlook for surrounding residential occupiers. The proposal would, therefore, fail to comply with the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990; policies LP1, LP2, LP3 and LP5 of the Wandsworth Local Plan (2023); policies D3, D12 and HC1 of the London Plan (2021); the Local Plan SPD 'Housing' (2016); and the Dover House Estate Conservation Area Appraisal.\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
