    "Reason : 1 - The proposed first floor rear terrace, due to its siting, design and location at first floor level, would be a prominent, visually intrusive and discordant  feature that would fail to relate appropriately to the host building and local spatial character. The proposal therefore fails to comply with policies LP1 and LP5 of the Wandsworth Local Plan (2023), and the Wandsworth Housing SPD (2016).\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed first floor rear terrace, due to its siting, design and location at first floor level, would be an unneighbourly form of development that would result in a sense of overbearing, loss of privacy, and noise and disturbance to the neighbouring property. The propsal would therefore be  harmful to the amenities of neighbouring occupiers and fails to comply with policy LP2 of the Wandsworth Local Plan (2023).",
    "Reason : 3 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
