    "Condition : 4 - INFORMATIVE: Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL): From the information available, it appears that the development permitted is subject to a Community Infrastructure Levy charge in accordance with the Community Infrastructure Levy Regulations 2010 (as amended) (the \"Regulations\"). \r\nYou or the relevant interested parties are required to provide the Council with the information set out in the Regulations. This process for the collection of CIL includes:  the requirement to complete an \"Assumption of Liability\" form as soon as possible;  in order to claim charitable exemption or social housing relief or other forms of relief you or the relevant interested party should also complete a \"Claiming Exemption or Relief\" form. \r\nThe Council will, if appropriate, then issue a Liability Notice(s) which details the charges due.

The assessment of the actual CIL liability will be provided pursuant to and in accordance with the Community Infrastructure Levy Regulations 2010 (as amended).  Where the calculation of CIL liability includes taking account of the existing use of a building, CIL liability may change if the information provided in relation to the existing use(s) of buildings, is not still current at the time of the decision which first permits development."
