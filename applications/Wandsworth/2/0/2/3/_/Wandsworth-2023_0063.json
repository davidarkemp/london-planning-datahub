    "Reason : 1 - The proposed rear roof extension by reason of location, scale and design would be an  unsympathetic, over dominant and incongruous addition that would result in harm upon the character and appearance of the host building and surrounding area. The proposal therefore fails to comply with policies PL1 and IS3 of the Core Strategy (2016), policies DMS1 and DMH5 of the Development Management Policies Document (2016), and the guidance within the Housing SPD, as well as policies LP1 and LP5 of the PVLP (2022).",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
