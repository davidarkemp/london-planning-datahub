    "Reason : 1 - This application, made under s.73 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended), is not capable of being assessed at it seeks to obtain planning permission for a development substantially different from the one which has been approved under 2022/0808 dated 27 May 2022.",
    "Reason : 2 - Notwithstanding reason for refusal one (1), the proposal by reason of its siting, scale, materials and design would result in an unsympathetic and incongruous addition, which would relate poorly to the host and neighbouring properties. The increased hardstanding, creation of the access and removal of the street tree would disintegrate the verdant character of the street scene and would result in less than substantial harm to the character and appearance of the Clapham Common Conservation Area whilst failing to provide any public benefit. The proposal would be contrary to policies DMS1, DMS2 and DMH5 of the Development Management Policies Document (2016), LP1, LP3 and LP5 of the Publication Version Local Plan (2022), the guidance within the Housing Supplementary Planning Document (2016) and the NPPF (2021).",
    "Reason : 3 - The applicant has failed to demonstrate that the provision of a parking space, new crossover and subsequent vehicular access would not result in an unacceptable degree of hazard to all highway users to the detriment of highway safety. The proposal would be contrary to Policy DMT1 of the DMPD (2016) and policy LP50 of the Publication Version Local Plan (2022).",
    "Reason : 4 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
