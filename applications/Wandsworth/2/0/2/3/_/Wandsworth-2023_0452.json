    "Reason : 1 - The application contravenes policies LP1, LP3 and LP5 of the local plan and therefore is refused. The subject extension harms the amenity and character of both the property and the wider conservation area to a point that is inacceptable. The principle of transforming the outbuildings on site into an extension of the main dwelling is objected to. The application also contravenes Section 72 (1) of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990, Policy HC1 (C) of the London Plan (2021) and paragraphs 199 and 202 of the NPPF (2021).",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
