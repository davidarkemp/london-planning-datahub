    "Reason : 1 - The proposal constitutes development under the Town and Country Planning Act 1990, and the local planning authority is not satisfied that, based on the drawings submitted as part of the application, this proposal falls within any class of 'permitted development' specified within Schedule 2 to the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).\r\n\r\nINFORMATIVE: The proposed development fails to comply with requirements A.1(2)(a) and A.1(2)(b) of Class A of Part 14, Schedule 2 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended) as the proposed works are noted to include a dish antenna to be installed on a MAFI frame at 38.1m in height. Therefore,  the height of the electronic communications apparatus (taken by itself) would exceed 10 metres, and the highest part of the electronic communications apparatus when installed, replaced would exceed the height of the highest part of the building by more than 8 metres, in the case of a building which is more than 15 metres but less than 30 metres in height.\r\n\r\nINFORMATIVE: The proposed development fails to comply with requirement A.1 (3) of Class A of Part 14, Schedule 2 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended) as the height of the mast (including the apparatus installed, altered or replaced) would exceed any relevant height limit specified in paragraph A.1(1)(c) or (d) or A.1(2)(a) or (b).\r\n\r\n\r\n"
