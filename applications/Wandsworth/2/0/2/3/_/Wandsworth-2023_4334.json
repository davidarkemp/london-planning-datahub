  "description": "T1, T2, T3, T4 - Lime: Suggested works are to fell the four trees and remove the stumps. Reasons for works: Trees dominate the end of the garden, casting dense shade to neighbouring properties as well. The owner receives regular complaints and has to have the trees regularly pruned at expense. Excessive honey dew renders that part of the garden unusable and plus lack of light prevents any other vegetation from growing in the area. Several of the trees have large wounds and cavities on the main trunks and have been heavily pruned over the years so visually not aesthetically pleasing to look at. If consent is given, more suitable species will be planted to maintain the amenity value of the garden.",
