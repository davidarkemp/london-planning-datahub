    "Reason : 1 - The proposed building by reason of its scale and siting would represent a large and dominant addition to the setting of the listed building, making its immediate setting cluttered and overdeveloped. It would also be visible from public areas in the conservation area and therefore result in harm to the special interest of these heritage assets without a justified need or public benefit and thus fails to accord with the statutory duty, NPPF (2021) paras 199, 200 and 202 and DMPD (2016) local policies DMS1, DMS2 and DMH5 as well as emerging local plan (2023) policies LP1 and LP3.",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
