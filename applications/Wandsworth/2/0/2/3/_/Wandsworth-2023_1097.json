    "Reason : 1 - The proposed building by reason of its scale and siting would represent a large and dominant addition to the setting of the listed building, making its immediate setting cluttered and overdeveloped. It would also be visible from public areas in the conservation area and therefore result in harm to the special interest of these heritage assets without a justified need or public benefit and thus fails to accord with the statutory duty, NPPF (2021) paras 199, 200 and 202 and Wandsworth's DMPD (2016) policies DMS1, DMS2 and DMH5 as well as emerging local plan (2023) policies LP1 and LP3.",
    "Reason : 2 - Insufficient details have been provided regarding the proposed acoustic timber fence as described in paragraph 6.1 of the KP Acoustics Planning Compliance Report to ensure that this would be a suitable design prior to installation and use of the ASHP so that this would not be contrary to the objectives of Wandsworth's DMPD (2016) policy DMS1, DMS2 and DMH5 together with emerging local plan (2023) policies LP1, LP2 and LP3.",
    "Reason : 3 - Insufficient details have been provided in relation to waste storage and servicing contrary to the objectives of Wandsworth's DMPD (2016) policy DMS1 and guidance within the Refuse and Recyclables in Development SPD (2014), together with emerging local plan (2023) policies LP2 (e).",
    "Reason : 4 - Insufficient details have been provided in relation to the amount or design of the proposed cycle and scooter parking in light of the Travel Plan. As such the proposal would be contrary to the objectives of Wandsworth's DMPD (2016) local policy DMT2 as well as emerging local plan (2023) LP51.",
    "Reason : 5 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
