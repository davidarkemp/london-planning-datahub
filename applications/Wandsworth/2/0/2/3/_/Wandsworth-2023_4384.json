    "Reason : 1 - The proposed rear terrace area, by reason of its style, scale, massing and siting, would be an inappropriate and incongruous addition to the subject property and would cause undue visual harm to the character and appearance of the host property and the surrounding area. In addition, the proposed development would, collectively, amount to overdevelopment. The proposal would cause undue harm to the amenity of surrounding residential occupiers in terms of being overbearing, overshadowing and privacy. The proposal would therefore fail to be in accordance with policies LP1, LP2, and LP5 of the Wandsworth Local Plan (2023); policy D3 of the London Plan (2021); and the Local Plan SPD 'Housing' (2016).",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
