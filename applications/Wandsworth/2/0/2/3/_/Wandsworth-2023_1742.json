  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development by reason of layout and design would result in harm to the amenities of future occupiers by way of restricted outlook, privacy, ventilation and natural light. The poor standard of accommodation is further apparent by the failure to provide adequate size and layout of dedicated external amenity space for the new units. The proposal therefore fails to comply with policy D6 of the London Plan (2021), policy LP27 of the Wandsworth Local Plan (2023) and the guidance within the Housing SPD (2016).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed development, by reason of its scale, design and location would result in an unneighbourly form of development to the harm of the amenities of neighbouring occupiers in terms of increased sense of enclosure, appearing overbearing and overshadowing. The proposal therefore fails to comply with policy LP2 of the Wandsworth Local Plan (2023) and the guidance within the Housing SPD (2016).",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed first floor roof terrace, by reason of its design, scale and location, directly on the street frontage, would represent an incongruous feature that would fail to integrate sympathetically with the host property and would result in harm to the character and appearance of the streetscene and wider area. The proposal therefore fails to comply with policies LP1 and LP5 of the Wandsworth Local Plan (2023) and the guidance within the Housing SPD (2016).",
    "Reason : 4 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan and Supplementary Planning documents as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
