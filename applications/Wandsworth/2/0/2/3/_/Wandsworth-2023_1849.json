    "Reason : 1 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal.",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposal by reason of its design, massing, and materials, would be an incongruous addition that would cause undue harm to the character and appearance of the host property, the street scene and to the heritage significance of this part of the Magdalen Park Conservation Area failing to be in accordance with policies DMS1, DMS2, DM5 and DMH7 of the Development Management Policies Document (2016); policies LP1, LP2, LP3, & LP5 of the draft Local Plan; and Section 72 (1) of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990, Policy HC1 (C) of the London Plan (2021) and paragraphs 199 and 202 of the NPPF (2021)."
