  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The development would by reason of its siting and appearance be of an overly dominant and visually intrusive scale, resulting in harm to the spatial character of the location, result in significantly prominent, bulky and unsightly apparatus causing undue clutter in the street scene and harming the amenity of adjoining properties. The proposal would therefore also harm the setting and character of the adjoining Rusholme Road Conservation Area.  The proposal therefore fails to comply with policies SI6 of the London Plan (2021), policy IS3 of the Wandsworth Core Strategy (2016) and policies LP1 and LP2 and LP22 of the Local Plan (2023)\r\n\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably. In addition further guidance was offered to the applicant by the case officer during the processing of the application to identify amendments to address those elements of the scheme considered unacceptable. However, the necessary amendments to make the application acceptable are substantial and would materially change the development proposal. They would require further consultations to be undertaken prior to determination, which could not take place within the statutory determination period specified by the Department of Communities and Local Government. You are therefore encouraged to consider submission of a fresh application incorporating the material amendments set out below which are necessary to make the scheme acceptable. \r\n\r\nRequired amendments:\r\n************************************************************\r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - It should be noted that the LPA has previously assessed and refused this proposal under 2022/4250.  There have been no material changes in the circumstances of the proposal or of the siting of the equipment that would overcome the previous reason for refusing the prior approval application. "
