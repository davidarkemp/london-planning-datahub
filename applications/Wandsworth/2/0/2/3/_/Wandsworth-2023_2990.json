If BEFORE the construction of the extension is substantially complete, any other extension is undertaken (such as the extension proposed by planning application ref 2023/2958), then this certificate would no longer be applicable and planning permission may be required for the development presently proposed.",

    "Condition : 4 - INFORMATIVE: This certificate is based on the drawings and any other information as submitted being a true reflection of the physical circumstances prevailing at the site on the date of the submission of the application. If the existing conditions are different from those shown on the drawings or if the drawings or any other information are inaccurate in any way, the certificate may not be valid. \r\n"
