    "Reason : 1 - By reason of lack of information provided, due to no heritage impact assessment being submitted, the Local Planning Authority cannot be satisfied that the proposed development would not harm nearby designated heritage assets, contrary to paragraphs 194 and 200 of the NPPF, London Plan Policy HC1 and Local Plan Policy LP3. ",
    "Reason : 2 - By reason of the harm to and loss of visual openness identified to Metropolitan Open Land, the development would constitute inappropriate development. It is not considered that there are any Very Special Circumstances that clearly outweighs this harm or the other harm identified, contrary to London Plan policy G3 and NPPF paragraphs 147, 148 and 149.",
    "Reason : 3 - By reason of the loss of habitat (trees and hedgerow) the proposal would result in the loss of biodiversity value on the site. It is not considered that the proposed mitigation and replacement planting would be sufficient to mitigate this loss, contrary to Policy LP55 of the Local Plan (2023).",
    "Reason : 4 - By reason of the loss of existing trees and the damage to an existing tree without adequate justification or mitigation, it is considered that the proposal would cause harm to the amenity and arboricultural value of the site contrary to Policy LP56 of the Local Plan (2023).",
    "Reason : 5 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
