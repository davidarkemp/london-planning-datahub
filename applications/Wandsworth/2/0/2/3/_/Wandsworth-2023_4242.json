    "Reason : 1 - The proposed telecommunications mast and associated equipment would, by reason of its siting and appearance, be of an overly dominant, overbearing and visually intrusive scale and design, harming the visual amenities and spatial character of the locality, and the setting and character of the Locally Listed Tooting Common Metropolitan Open Land, and the adjoining Heaver Estate Conservation Area. The proposal would not meet with the relevant conditions attached to Class A of Part 16 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order and would be contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2023), policies SI6 and G3 of the London Plan (2021) and policies LP1, LP2, LP3, LP22 and LP53 of the Wandsworth Local Plan (2023)."
