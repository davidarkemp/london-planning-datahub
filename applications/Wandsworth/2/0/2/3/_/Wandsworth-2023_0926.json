The Council has made available detailed advice in the form of its statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning Documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre-application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably. In addition, where appropriate, further guidance was offered to the applicant during the processing of the application.  ",
    "Condition : 13 - INFORMATIVE: Trinity Road forms part of the Transport for London Road Network (TLRN). The footway and carriageway must not be blocked during the development. All vehicles associated with the development must only park / stop at permitted locations and within the time periods permitted by existing on-street restrictions. In the event any Red Route dispensations are sought, these must be agreed with TfL in writing before the work.\r\nShould the applicant wish to carry out any work that would require a highway licence, for example for scaffolding or a hoarding on the footway whilst undertaking this work, separate licences may be required with TfL, please see, https://eur01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftfl.gov.uk%2Finfo-for%2Furban-planning-and-construction%2Four-land-andinfrastructure%2Fhighwaylicences%3Fintcmp%3D3496&amp;data=04%7C01%7CWandsworthplanningapplications%40richmondandwandsworth.gov.uk%7C69c019b35105498ea5c608d9f61506c6%7Cd9d3f5acf80349be949f14a7074d74a7%7C0%7C0%7C637811392593165258%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000&amp;sdata=gXMwXhzn4Hw1gOIPS%2BmuSxx7Ma9dpoEgX5UwRfOfmSc%3D&amp;reserved=0.  ",
    "Reason : 1 - The application site is located within a defined Protected Other frontage within the Tooting Bec Local Centre and therefore forms part of a key local shopping area. By reason of the change of use of the substantial part of the unit from commercial (Class E) to a dwelling (Class C3), the proposed development would result in a harmful impact on the adequate provision of services within the local shopping frontage and the sustainability, vitality and viability of the local shopping area. As such, the application fails to accord within policies DMTS1 and DMTS5 of the Wandsworth Development Management Policies Document (2016), policies LP41 and LP42 of the Wandsworth Publication (Regulation 19) version Local Plan (2023).",
    "Reason : 2 - By reason of the unit layout and design, the proposed development would result in a poor standard of accommodation with a lack of adequate natural light and outlook to all habitable rooms for future occupiers. The proposal therefore fails to comply with policies D3 and D6 of the London Plan (2021), policies DMS1, DMH4 and DMH6 of the Wandsworth Development Management Policies Document (2016) and policies LP1, LP2 and LP27 of the Wandsworth Publication Version Local Plan (2023).",
    "Reason : 3 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably. In addition further guidance was offered to the applicant by the case officer during the processing of the application to identify amendments to address those elements of the scheme considered unacceptable. However, the necessary amendments to make the application acceptable are substantial and would materially change the development proposal. They would require further consultations to be undertaken prior to determination, which could not take place within the statutory determination period specified by the Department of Communities and Local Government. \r\n"
