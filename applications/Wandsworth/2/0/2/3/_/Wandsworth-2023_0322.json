  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development, by reason of its siting, scale, massing, bulk and design would constitute an unsympathetic and incongruous form of development that would dominate and compete with the existing building. The proposed five-storey building would be located in an area outside of the identified mid-rise building zone and would relate poorly to the host building, neighbouring properties and streetscape resulting in harm to the local spatial character. In addition, the proposal would result in less than substantial harm to the setting of Grade II listed St. Anselms Roman Catholic Church, and Grade II listed St Anselm's Convent School, whilst failing to provide any public benefit to outweigh the harm. The proposal would be contrary to policies PL1 and IS3 of the Core Strategy (2016), policies DMS1, DMS2, DMS4 and DMH5 of the Development Management Policies Document (2016), policies LP1, LP3, LP4 and LP5 of the PVLP (2023), the guidance within the Housing Supplementary Planning Document (2016) as well as the NPPF (2021).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed development by reason of its design, scale, height and location would be an unneighbourly form of development that would have a detrimental impact on the amenity of neighbouring properties at No.295 Balham High Road in the form of loss outlook, being overbearing and creating an increased sense of enclosure. The proposal has also failed to demonstrate that there would not be unacceptable harm to neighbouring windows in respect to reductions in daylight and sunlight. The proposal would therefore be contrary to policy DMS1 of the Development Management Policies Document (2016) and policy LP2 of the PVLP (2023).",
    "Reason : 3 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
