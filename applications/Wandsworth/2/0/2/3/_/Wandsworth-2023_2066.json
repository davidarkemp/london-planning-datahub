    "Reason : 1 - The proposal, by reason of its siting and design, would be an unsympathetic and incongruous development that would disrupt the visual cohesiveness of the locality, resulting in harm to the character and appearance of the host dwelling, the street scene and the Wandsworth Common Conservation Area. The proposal is therefore contrary to policy HC1 of the London Plan (2021), policies LP1, LP3 and LP5 of the Wandsworth Local Plan (2023) and the design guidance within the Wandsworth Housing Supplementary Planning Document (2016) and the Wandsworth Common Conservation Area Appraisal & Management Strategy: Sub-area J - Bolingbroke Grove (2008).",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably. In addition further guidance was offered to the applicant by the case officer during the processing of the application to identify amendments to address those elements of the scheme considered unacceptable. However, the necessary amendments to make the application acceptable are substantial and would materially change the development proposal. They would require further consultations to be undertaken prior to determination, which could not take place within the statutory determination period specified by the Department of Communities and Local Government.\r\n"
