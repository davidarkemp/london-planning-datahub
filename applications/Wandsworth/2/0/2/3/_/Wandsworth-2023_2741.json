    "Reason : 1 - The proposed single storey extension would have a dominant and overbearing effect upon the outlook from No.127 to the extent such that the living conditions of the occupiers of that property are harmed. As such, the proposal would be contrary to the NPPF (2023) and Policy LP2 of Wandsworth Local Plan (2023).",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan (2023) as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
