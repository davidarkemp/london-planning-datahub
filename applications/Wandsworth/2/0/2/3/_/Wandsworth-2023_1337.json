    "Reason : 1 - The proposal by reason of its design, materials, lack of ground floor frontage would result in an unacceptable and incongruous design detrimental to the character and appearance of the surrounding area. The proposal would therefore by contrary to adopted Wandsworth Local Plan policy PL1",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposal by reason of its design and layout would result in inadequate amenity space and substandard accommodation for future occupiers in terms of ceiling heights and light contrary to London Plan (2021) policy D6, Wandsworth Local Plan (2023) policy LP27 and the Technical Housing Standards - nationally described space standard and the London Plan Housing Design Standards LPG",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposal by reason of its size, scale, siting and proximity to neighbouring boundaries would result in an unacceptable impact upon neighbouring properties at 150 Putney Bridge Road in terms of outlook and light. The proposal would therefore be contrary to adopted Wandsworth Local Plan policy LP2",
    "Reason : 4 - The development by reason of its siting and design would provide inadequate waste provision for future occupants whilst resulting in possible conflict with neighbouring properties. The proposal is therefore contrary to Local Plan policy LP2 and the Council's adopted 'Refuse and Recyclables in developments (2014)' SPD.",
    "Reason : 5 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably. In addition further guidance was offered to the applicant by the case officer during the processing of the application to identify amendments to address those elements of the scheme considered unacceptable. However, the necessary amendments to make the application acceptable are substantial and would materially change the development proposal. They would require further consultations to be undertaken prior to determination, which could not take place within the statutory determination period specified by the Department of Communities and Local Government. You are therefore encouraged to consider submission of a fresh application incorporating the material amendments set out below which are necessary to make the scheme acceptable. \r\n\r\nRequired amendments:\r\n-Revised design\r\n-Increased amenity space \r\n-Comply with required ceiling heights\r\n-Provide adequate waste provision "
