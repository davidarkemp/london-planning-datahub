    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development would result in a net loss of residential units without meeting any of the exceptions criteria outlined in LP25. Furthermore, the application has also failed to demonatrate that the location would be appropriate for visitor accommodation. The proposal would therefore result in harm to the housing stock within the borough and be contrary to Policies LP25 and LP46 of the Wandsworth Local Plan (2023), and policies H8 and H9 of the London Plan (2021). ",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
