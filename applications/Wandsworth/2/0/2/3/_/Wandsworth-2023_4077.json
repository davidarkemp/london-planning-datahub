    "Reason : 1 - The extract flue, by reason of its position, size and design, would be an unneighbourly form of development that results in loss of outlook and an increased sense of enclosure to the residential window it adjoins. Furthermore, the application has failed to demonstrate that the extract flue would not result in an unacceptable impact on neighbouring residential amenity in terms of odour emissions. As such, the proposal is contrary to Policies LP2 and LP14 of the Wandsworth Local Plan (2023).\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan (2023), Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
