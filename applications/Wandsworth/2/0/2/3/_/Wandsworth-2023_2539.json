    "Reason : 1 - The application has failed to demonstrate that the proposed air conditioning units would not result in unacceptable harm, in terms of noise and disturbance, to neighbouring occupiers. The proposal therefore fails to comply with policy LP2 of the Wandsowrth Local Plan (adopted July 2023). \r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The air conditioning units by reason of their siting, scale and appearance constitute an unsympathetic and discordant feature that is harmful to the character and appearance of the property, to the visual amenities of the surrounding area and to the detriment of the Holmside Road streetscene. The development is therefore contrary to policies LP1 and LP5 of the Wandsworth Local Plan (adopted 2023) and the Housing SPD (2016).  ",
    "Reason : 3 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
