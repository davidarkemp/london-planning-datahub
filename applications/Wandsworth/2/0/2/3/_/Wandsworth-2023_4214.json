    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development reason of its design and layout would fail to provide an acceptable standard of accommodation for the future occupiers of both the proposed first floor studio and the ground floor flats. The first-floor studio would fail to meet minimum space standards and would have poor levels of outlook for future occupiers. The ground floor flat would fail to meet minimum external amenity area standards and would have poor levels of outlook and privacy. Both flats have also failed to demonstrate that an appropriate level of internal daylight would be achieved. The proposal is therefore contrary to policy LP27 of the Wandsworth Local Plan (2023) and the Technical housing standards- nationally described space standard 2015.",
    "Reason : 2 - The development would by reason of its scale, massing and design would constitute a prominent extension that would fail to relate appropriately to the existing property and the terrace it forms part of. The extension would significantly reduce the open nature and visual gap between the Garratt Lane terrace and the nearest Khartoum Road property to the harm of local spatial character.  The proposal therefore fails to comply with policies LP1, LP5 and LP7 of the Wandsworth Local Plan 2023 and the Housing SPD.",
    "Reason : 3 - The development would by reason of its scale, massing and design would result in harm to the amenity of the neighbouring property. In particular application has failed to demonstrate that the extension would result in a harm to the daylight of the habitable windows of No. 1 Khartoum Road. The proposal would therefore fails to comply with policy LP2 of the Wandsworth Local Plan 2023 and the Housing SPD.",
    "Reason : 4 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
