    "Reason : 1 - By reason of scale, design and location, the proposed development would constitute an unsympathetic and incongruous form of development that would appear overly dominant and relate poorly to the host building, adjacent hipped roof semi-detached property and wider local streetscape. The proposed development would result in less than substantial harm to the character and appearance of the Wandsworth Common Conservation Area, for which no public benefits have been identified that would outweigh the harm caused to the character and appearance of the conservation area. Accordingly, the proposals fail to conform to Section 72(1) of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990, the NPPF (2023), policy HC1 of the London Plan (2021), policies LP1, LP3 and LP5 of the Wandsworth Local Plan (2023),  the guidance within the Housing SPD (2016) and the Wandsworth Common Conservation Area Appraisal and Management Strategy: Sub Area J - Bolingbroke Grove (2008).",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan and Supplementary Planning documents as well as offering a full pre application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably. In addition further guidance was offered to the applicant by the case officer during the processing of the application to identify amendments to address those elements of the scheme considered unacceptable. However, negotiation of an accetpable development proposal was not possible in this instance. "
