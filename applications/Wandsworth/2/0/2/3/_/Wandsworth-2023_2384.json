    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development, by reason of its scale, bulk and siting, would be considered an inappropriate and incongruous addition to the original dwellinghouse that would cause undue harm to the special character and appearance of the host property and the Wandsworth Common Conservation Area. The proposed extensions would be substantial and would overwhelm the original dwellinghouse, ensuring the loss of its original character and appearance and detracting further from its original form and scale due to cumulative overdevelopment. Therefore, the scheme fails to be in accordance with the aims of the NPPF (2023); the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act (1990); policies D3 and HC1 of the London Plan (2021); policies LP1, LP2, LP3 and LP5 of the Wandsworth Local Plan (2023); the Local Plan SPD 'Housing' (2016); and the Wandsworth Common Conservation Area Appraisal C (Spencer Park).",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably. In addition further guidance was offered to the applicant by the case officer during the processing of the application to identify amendments to address those elements of the scheme considered unacceptable. However, the necessary amendments to make the application acceptable are substantial and would materially change the development proposal. They would require further consultations to be undertaken prior to determination, which could not take place within the statutory determination period specified by the Department of Communities and Local Government. \r\n"
