    "Reason : 1 - By reason of the scale and siting of the proposed hip to gable side roof extension its is considered that it would appear as an incongruous addition that would disrupt the rhythm of the uniform roof pitches within the street, causing less than substantial harm to the character and appearance of the conservation area. No public benefits exist that could outweigh this harm. The proposed development is therefore contrary to Local Plan Policies LP1, LP2 and LP3, London Plan Policy HC1 and NPPF paragraphs: 190 and 196.",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
