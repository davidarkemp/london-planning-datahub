    "Reason : 1 - The proposed refuse storage arrangements, by reason of their scale, would provide inadequate waste and recycling storage capacity for the number of flats in the development. The Council is therefore not satisified that adequate details have been provided contrary to DMPD policy DMS1 and the Refuse and Recyclables SPD (2014) and condition 4 can therefore not be discharged. ",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably. You are therefore encouraged to consider submission of a fresh application incorporating the material amendments set out below which are necessary to make the scheme acceptable. \r\n\r\nRequired amendments:\r\n-Provide details of waste and recycling storage for all flats in the development.\r\n-Provide sufficent waste storage capacity for all flats in accordance with the requirements of the Councils 'Refuse and recyclables in developments' SPD (2014)\r\n"
