    "Reason : 1 - The proposal, by way of its inappropriate and modern door design, would cause less than substantial harm to the Dover House Estate Conservation Area, failing to preserve or enhance its character, and is therefore recommended for refusal. The proposed door is not in line with recommended styles, and not in accordance with policies LP1, LP2, and LP3 of the Local Plan (2023); Section 72 (1) of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990; Policy HC1 (C) of the London Plan (2021) and paragraphs 199 and 202 of the NPPF (2023).",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
