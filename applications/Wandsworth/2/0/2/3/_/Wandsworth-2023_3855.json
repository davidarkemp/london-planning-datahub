Medium horse chestnut tree  T156 (TPO 68/1985)(approx 20m high x 6m wide) The tree has 3 main stems and one has split and fallen hitting a car and a person (they have cuts to their head). There is rot at the base of the tree (under where it split) and the rest of the tree is directly above this. The clients on site are very concerned about the tree and ensuring it is safe for the residents. - Fell There is also a lean to the tree which makes it more of a cause for concern. 2. Small London Plane tree Remove limb growing from base of tree over the path. Cut back to main trunk.",
