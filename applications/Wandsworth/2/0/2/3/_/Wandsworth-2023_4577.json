    "Condition : 2 - INFORMATIVE: You are advised that in the event that use of the kiosk ceases or alters in a manner so as to leave this structure without function, then the structures shall be removed in their entirety and the land made good to the same condition as the adjacent land within 3 months of the cessation of the use of the structure. The reason for this is to prevent the retention of redundant equipment in public realm in order to ensure no long term harm to the appearance, amenity and public safety of the location in accordance with Council Policies LP1, LP49 and LP50.\r\n"
