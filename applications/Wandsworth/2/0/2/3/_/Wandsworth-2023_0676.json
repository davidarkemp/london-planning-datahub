    "Reason : 1 - The extension by reason of its size, location, and design would be an inappropriate and incongruous addition that would cause undue harm to the appearance of the principal elevation and terrace of which the building is part. It would also be harmful to the amenity of neighbouring occupiers in the form of overshadowing and increased sense of enclosure. \r\nThe proposal therefore fails to comply with policies DMS1 and DMH5 of the Development Management Policies Document (2016), and Policies LP1, LP2, and LP5 of the Draft Local Plan.",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
