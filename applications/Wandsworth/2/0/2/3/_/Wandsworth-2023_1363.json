  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The development would by reason of its design, scale and location result in an incongruous extension that would visually disrupt the existing terrace form and pattern creating a negative visual and physical impact to the street. \r\nThe proposal therefore fails to comply with policies DMS1 and DMH5 of the Development Management Policies Document (2016), and guidance within the Housing SPD (2016) and draft policies LP1, LP2 and LP5 of the PVLP (2023). \r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
