  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The application site is located within a defined Protected Other frontage within the Tooting Bec Local Centre and therefore forms part of a key local shopping area. By reason of the change of use of the substantial part of the unit from commercial (Class E) to a dwelling (Class C3), the proposed development would result in a harmful impact on the adequate provision of services within the local shopping frontage and the sustainability, vitality and viability of the local shopping area. As such, the application fails to accord within policies LP41 and LP42 of the Wandsworth Local Plan (2023). ",
    "Reason : 2 - By reason of the unit layout and design, the proposed development would result in a poor standard of accommodation with a lack of adequate outlook to all habitable rooms for future occupiers. The proposal therefore fails to comply with policies D3 and D6 of the London Plan (2021) and policies LP1, LP2 and LP27 of the Wandsworth Local Plan (2023).",
    "Reason : 3 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the  proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
