    "Reason : 1 - By reason of the scale, design and siting of the proposed development, it would fail to maintain subservience to the existing property and reducing the visual uniformity of the terrace, which would cause less than substantial harm to the character and appearance of the conservation area, with no public benefits identified that would outweigh this harm. The proposal therefore contravenes with policies LP1 and LP3 of the new Local Plan and Section 72 (1) of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 and paragraphs 199 and 202 of the NPPF (2023).",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
