    "Reason : 1 - The alterations to the shopfront are inappropriate and fail to respect the visual amenity and character and appearance of the building and terrace of which it forms a part. The shopfront results in an inappropriately narrow and cluttered appearance to the frontage that would detract from its Protected Other Frontage designation. The proposal does not adequately address accessibility. The additional information provided is not considered sufficient to overcome the harm to the shopfront and justify the alterations made. The development therefore fails to accord with Local Plan policies LP1, LP8 and LP42 (adopted July 2023).",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
