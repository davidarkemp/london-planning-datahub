    "Reason : 1 - The proposed front extension, by reason of its siting, scale and design would constitute an inappropriate and incongruous form of development that would visually disrupt the architectural rhythm of the terrace and thereby relate poorly to the existing and neighbouring properties to the harm of the character and appearance of the streetscene.  Furthermore, inadequate details have been provided of the design and appearance of the proposed bicycle store and heat pump in order to make a full assessment. Accordingly, the proposal would fail to comply with policies DMS1 and DMH5 of the Development Management Policies Document (2016), policies LP1 and LP5 of the Publication Version Local Plan (2023) and the Housing SPD (2016). ",
    "Reason : 2 - The application has failed to demonstrate that the proposed heat pump would not result in harm to neighbouring properties in terms of noise and disturbance. The proposals therefore fail to comply with policy DMS1c of the DMPD (2016) and LP2 (b) of the PVLP (2023). ",
    "Reason : 3 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
