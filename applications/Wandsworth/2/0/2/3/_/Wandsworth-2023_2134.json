    "Reason : 1 - The development would by reason of its form and scale would result in an overly dominant and unsympathetic additions to the existing property which would harm to locally listed building, locally listed terrace group and the character and appearance of the Westbridge Road Conservation Area. The proposal would therefore fail to be in accordance with policies LP1, LP3 and LP5 of the Wandsworth Local Plan 2023 and the guidance within the Housing SPD 2016. The proposal would also be contrary to Section 72 (1) of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990, Policy HC1 (C) of the London Plan (2021) and paragraph 199, 202 and 203 of the NPPF (2021).",
    "Reason : 2 - The development would by, reason of its unneighbourly position and scale, would result in harm to the amenity of the neighbouring properties by loss of daylight/sunlight and outlook, as well as resulting in a detrimental sense of enclosure. The proposal therefore fails to comply with policy LP2 of the Wandsworth Local Plan (2023) as well as the guidance within the Housing SPD 2016.",
    "Reason : 3 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan (2023) as well as offering a full pre application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably. In addition further guidance was offered to the applicant by the case officer during the processing of the application to identify amendments to address those elements of the scheme considered unacceptable. However, the necessary amendments to make the application acceptable are substantial and would materially change the development proposal. They would require further consultations to be undertaken prior to determination, which could not take place within the statutory determination period specified by the Department of Communities and Local Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n"
