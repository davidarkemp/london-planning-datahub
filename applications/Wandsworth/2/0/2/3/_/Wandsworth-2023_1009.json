    "Condition : 3 - Noise levels emitted by the air source heat pumps and fan units hereby approved shall not exceed the following maximum levels when the plant is operating and when measured or predicted at 1m from the fa�ade of the nearest sensitive receptor:\r\nDaytime (between 0700 and 2300): 37 dB LA90, 15min\r\nNight-time (between 2300 and 0700): 33 dB LA90, 15min\r\nReason: In the interests of neighbour amenity in accordance with Council policy DMS1 of the Development Management Policies Document (adopted March 2016) coupled with the requirements of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021.\r\n",
    "Condition : 4 - Prior to their installation full details of the acoustic louvres to the enclosure for the air source heat pumps and the noise attenuators for the rooftop fans shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority to demonstrate that they provide sufficient mitigation to ensure the development shall not exceed the noise emission limits detailed in condition 1 above. The development shall be carried out in complete accordance with the approved details and use of the equipment shall not commence until such time as the approved measures have been installed, and they shall be maintained as such thereafter.\r\nReason: In the interests of neighbour amenity in accordance with Council policy DMS1 of the Development Management Policies Document (adopted March 2016) coupled with the requirements of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021.\r\n",

The plant and any related equipment shall be serviced and subsequently maintained to ensure that it continues to be within the maximum noise levels detailed in condition 3. If at any time it is shown that noise emissions fail to comply with this requirement the equipment shall cease being used until such time as written consent to continue with its use has been given by the local planning authority.  \r\nReason: In the interests of neighbour amenity in accordance with Council policy DMS1 of the Development Management Policies Document (adopted March 2016) coupled with the requirements of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021.\r\n \r\n",
