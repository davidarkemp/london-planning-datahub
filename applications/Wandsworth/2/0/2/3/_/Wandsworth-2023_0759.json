    "Reason : 1 - The development by reason of scale, design and siting would constitute an unneighbourly form of development that would have a particularly harmful impact on the amenity of the neighbouring occupiers at nos. 36 and 38 Lavender Sweep in the form of loss outlook, being overbearing and creating an increased sense of enclosure. The proposal has also failed to demonstrate that there would not be unacceptable harm to neighbouring windows and external amenity spaces in respect to reductions in daylight and sunlight. The proposed extension would therefore be contrary to policy DMS1 (c) of the Development Management Policies Document (2016), guidance of the Housing SPD (2016) and emerging policy LP2 (b) of the Publication Version Local Plan (Regulation 19 Version) (2023).",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
