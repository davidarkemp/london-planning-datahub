    "Reason : 1 - The application has failed to provide sufficient arboricultural reason and\r\njustification for the removal of two of the three mature Lime trees (TG3) along the southwestern boundary of the property and protected by the Tree Preservation Order (T19, T20 and T21 of ref no.10/1996). Additionally, the mature trees make a positive contribution to local visual amenity and their loss on the site would result in harm to the character and appearance of the Battersea Park Conservation Area. The level of harm would not be outweighed by public benefits. The proposal therefore fails to comply with the NPPF (2023), policies LP3 and LP56 of the Local Plan (2023).\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed development would not provide a minimum of 1metre of naturally draining permeable soil together with the minimum 200mm drainage layer above the basement in the garden area. The development would therefore reduce opportunities for planting and not provide adequate sustainable drainage for the development. The proposal therefore fails to comply with policy LP6 of the Local Plan (2023).\r",
    "Reason : 3 - INFORMATIVE: The applicant is advised to submit an 'Application for Tree Works: Works to Trees Subject to a Tree Preservation Order (TPO)' for the  removal and replacement of the single Lime tree (T21 of TPO No.10 of 1996) (east most in TG3). Evidence of root loss/damage should be submitted in this application along with details of a replacment Lime tree to be planted in the same location. ",
