    "Reason : 1 - The proposed structure would by reason of scale, design and location result in an obtrusive and inappropriate form of extension that is out of character with neighbouring properties and detrimental to the appearance of the building and the overall character of the streetscene of Battersea High Street. The proposal therefore fails to comply with policies LP1 and LP8 of the Wandsworth Local Plan (2023). \r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed development, by reason of its scale, design and location, would would hinder the convenient and safe passage of pedestrians in an area of limited footway width for the high demands placed on it and would create an unnecessary obstruction of the public space. Pedestrians would be required to engage in dangerous crossing strategies whilst attempting to bypass patrons and staff occupying the footway for a considerable distance. \r\nThe proposal therefore fails to comply with Policies LP1, LP2 and LP50 of the Wandsworth Local Plan (2023).\r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
