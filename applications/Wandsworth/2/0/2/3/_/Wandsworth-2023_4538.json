  "description": "Our tree surgeon came to carry out the recent application pruning to the lime, strawberry and bay tree (No 2 on sketch). He pointed out that one of the boughs of the bay was bearing on the boundary wall and was posing a danger to the integrity of the wall which could pose a health and safety risk, he has recommended removing this bough, which is approx 10cms diameter. I have supplied pictures of the tree, the contact point with the wall and the proposed cut point.",
