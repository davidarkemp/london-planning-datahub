    "Reason : 1 - Given its excessive size, scale and high level prominent location, it is considered that the proposed vinyl advertisement would be an obtrusive, conspicuous and unsympathetic feature, that would detract from the visual amenity of the host building and be harmful to the character and appearance of the surroundings. As a result, the proposed vinyl advert would fail to comply with the NPPF (2021), the NPPG (2019) and policy and DMS8 of Wandsworth's Development Management Policies Document (2016). "
