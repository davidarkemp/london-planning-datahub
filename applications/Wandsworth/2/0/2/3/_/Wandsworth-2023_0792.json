    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development would result in the retention of a small 16.7sqm commercial unit at ground floor level.  This would not provide attractive commercial floorspace to a range occupiers and this would undermine the function of the Important Local Parade contrary to the provisions of policies LP41 and LP42 of the Councils Publication Local Plan (2023), and policies DMTS1 and DMTS6 of the Councils adopted Development Management Policies Document (2016).  ",
    "Reason : 2 - A substandard level of residential accommodation would be provided for occupiers of the ground floor residential dwelling by reason of the very poor levels of outlook and daylight penetration that would afforded to this dwelling, contrary to the provisions of policy LP27 of the Councils Publication Local Plan (2023), policy DMH5 of the Councils adopted Development Management Policies Document (2016) and the Mayors Housing SPG (2016).",
    "Reason : 3 - It has not been demonstrated that suitable and safe bedrooms can be provided at ground floor level in a Flood Risk Zone 2, contrary to the provisions of LP12 and adopted policy DMS5 of the Councils adopted Development Management Policies Document (2016).  ",
    "Reason : 4 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
