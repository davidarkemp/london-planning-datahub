    "Reason : 1 - The proposal constitutes development under the Town and Country Planning Act 1990, and the local planning authority is not satisfied that, based on the drawings submitted as part of the application, this proposal falls within any class of 'permitted development' specified within Schedule 2 to the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).\r\nINFORMATIVE: The proposed development fails to comply with condition (d) (i) of Class B.1 of Part 1, Schedule 2 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended) as the resulting roof space of the dormer extension to main rear roof and above the two-storey back addition of the mid-terrace property would exceed the cubic content of the original roof space by more than 40 cubic metres.\r\n\r\n"
