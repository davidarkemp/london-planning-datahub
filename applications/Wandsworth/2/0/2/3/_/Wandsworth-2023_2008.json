    "Reason : 1 - By reason of the scale and siting of the proposed development, the proposal would reduce the amount of green infrastructure on the site, which would harm the character, appearance and function of the existing communal garden (open space) and the wider area. The development would result in a reduction in green infrastructure on the site, with no exceptional circumstances demonstrated and no appropriate compensatory provision provided contrary to policies LP1 and LP53 the Local Plan (2023). ",
    "Reason : 2 - By reason of the scale, design and siting of the proposed development it is considered that it would relate poorly to the character of the immediate area and remove important green character features. It is therefore considered that the proposed development would fail to achieve a high-level of integration with its surroundings, would not be well designed and would not contribute positively to the local spatial character. Contrary to Local Plan (2023) Policies LP1 and LP7 and London Plan policies D1, D2, D4 and H2.",
    "Reason : 3 - By reason of the scale and siting of the proposed development it is considered that it would have an unacceptable overbearing impact on the users of existing communal garden areas adjacent to the site, in significant detriment to residential amenity, contrary to Policy LP2 of the Local Plan (2023). ",
    "Reason : 4 - By reason of the proposed loss of existing trees on the site of amenity and ecological value, their removal would be in signficant detriment to visual amenity and the ecological value of the site. It is not considered that the proposed replacement planting would sufficiently mitigate for this loss, contrary to Local Plan (2023) Policies: LP55 and LP56.  ",
    "Reason : 5 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
