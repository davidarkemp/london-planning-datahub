  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed first floor roof terrace would result in an incongruous and visually intrusive addition to the rear elevation of the property, out of character with the predominant local pattern of development. It would therefore be contrary to policies DMS1 and DMH5 of the Development Management Policies Document (2016), policies LP1 and LP5 of the PVLP (2023) and the guidance contained in the Wandsworth Housing SPD (2016).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed roof terrace, by reason of its design and first floor location would result in harmful loss of privacy through actual and perceived overlooking and result in unacceptable levels of noise and disturbance to neighbouring properties. The proposal would therefore be detrimental to neighbouring amenity, contrary to policy DMS1 of the Development Management Policies Document (2016) and policy LP2 of the PVLP (2023). ",
    "Reason : 3 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
