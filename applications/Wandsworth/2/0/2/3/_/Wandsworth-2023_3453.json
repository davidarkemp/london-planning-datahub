    "Reason : 1 - The proposed rear dormer roof extension, by reason of its size, location and form, would result in an over-dominant and incongruous addition that would appear unsympathetic to the original dwellinghouse and would disrupt the consistency of local spatial character. This would cause undue harm to the special character and appearance of the host property and the Sutherland Grove Conservation Area. \r\n\r\nThe proposed development would cause less than substantial harm to the heritage asset without public benefits to outweigh the identified harm. Therefore, the scheme fails to be in accordance with the aims of the NPPF (2023); the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act (1990); policies D3 and HC1 of the London Plan (2021); policies LP1, LP3 and LP5 of the Wandsworth Local Plan (2023); the Local Plan SPD 'Housing' (2016); and the Sutherland Grove Conservation Area Appraisal and Management Strategy.\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
