    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development, by reason of its height, scale, massing, form and materials, would be considered an inappropriate addition to the original dwellinghouse and the local area. The proposed development would be over-dominant, would fail to appear sympathetic to the original dwellinghouse and would appear uncharacteristic in the context of its setting. The proposed development would also cause harm to the setting of the Putney Embankment Conservation Area. For these reasons, the proposed development would fail to be in accordance with the aims of the NPPF (2023); policies D3 and HC1 of the London Plan (2021); policies LP1, LP3 and LP5 of the Wandsworth Local Plan (2023); and the Local Plan SPD 'Housing' (2016).",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
