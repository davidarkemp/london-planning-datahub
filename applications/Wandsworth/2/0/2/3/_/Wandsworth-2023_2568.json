    "Reason : 1 - The proposed roof extension is of inappropriate design, appearing bulky and is not subservient to the host, and does not adhere to the guidelines set out in the Housing SPD. It would have a negative impact on the amenity of neighbours, infringing on privacy and creating a sense of overbearing, while also impacting the provision of light to the lower levels. The proposal is therefore in contravention of Policies LP1, LP2, and LP5 of the Local Plan (2023), the Housing SPD (2016), the NPPF (2021), and the London Plan (2021). It is thus recommended for refusal.",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
