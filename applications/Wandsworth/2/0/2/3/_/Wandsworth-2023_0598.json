    "Reason : 1 - The applicant has failed to demonstrate through the provision of sufficient evidence that the lawful use of the subject site falls within Class E as required. The proposal also relates to the erection of a detached pergola, not attached to the main building and would therefore not form an extension or alteration. Therefore, the proposed development is not considered to fall under Class A, Part 7, Schedule 2 'the extension or alteration of a commercial, business or service establishment'.  \r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The gross floor space of the original building would be exceeded by more than 50% contrary to A.1(a) of Class A, Part 7, Schedule 2 of The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015.",
    "Reason : 3 - The development is on land which adjoins other premises which are used for a purpose falling within any of the classes in Part C (residential premises or institutions) of the Schedule 1 to the Use Classes Order; and is within 2 metres of any boundary of the curtilage of the premises contrary to A.1(c) of Class A, Part 7, Schedule 2 of The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015.
