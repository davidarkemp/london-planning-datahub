    "Reason : 1 - By reason of their design, siting, size and scale the roof extension, including increased ridge height and associated alterations to the front roof slope form a prominent, unsympathetic and visually intrusive addition to the original building, streetscene and locality. They fail to physically integrate with their surroundings and detract from the local spatial character by upsetting the symmetry of this terrace of properties. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policies IS3 and PL1 of the Core Strategy (2016), policies DMS1 and DMH5 of the Development Management Policies Document (2016) and the Housing (2016). They also fail to meet emerging policies LP1 and LP5 of the Wandsworth Publication Version Local Plan (Regulation 19 version) (2023).\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
