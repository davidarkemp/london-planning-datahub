    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development fails to constitute as permitted development which requires prior approval from the local planning authority, per Schedule 2, Part 16, Class A of the General Permitted Development Order 2015 (as amended), as it has not been demonstrated that the developer has served notice on every person described in sub-paragraph (1) of A.3 of Part 16 of the GPDO (2015).\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed telecommunications mast and associated equipment would by reason of its siting and appearance be of an overly dominant and visually intrusive scale and design, resulting in undue and excessive clutter in the open streetscene, harming the visual amenities and spatial character of the locality, and the setting of the Clapham Common Conservation Area and openness of the Metropolitan Open Land (Clapham Common). The proposal would not meet with the relevant conditions attached to the Class A of Part 16 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order and would be contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Section 72(1) of the Planning (Listed Building and Conservation Areas) Act 1990, policies SI6 and G3 of the London Plan (2021), policy IS3 of the Wandsworth Core Strategy (2016), policies DMS1, DMS2, DMO1 and DMS9 of the Wandsworth Development Management Policies Document (2016) and policies LP1, LP3 and LP22 of the Local Plan Publication (Regulation 19) version with modifications (PVLP) (2023). \r\n\r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - The application has failed to demonstrate that the proposed telecommunications mast and associated equipment would not, by reason of its siting and scale, create an unnecessary obstruction of the public space, which could hinder the convenient and safe passage of pedestrians and cyclists, given the demands placed on it. The proposal would therefore not meet with the relevant conditions attached to the Class A of Part 16 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order and would be contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policies T1 and ST4 of the London Plan (2021), policy IS3 of the Wandsworth Core Strategy (2016), policies DMS1, DMS9 and DMT1 of the Wandsworth Development Management Policies Document (2016) and policies LP1, LP22 and LP50 of the Local Plan Publication (Regulation 19) version with modifications (PVLP) (2023).\r\n\r\n"
