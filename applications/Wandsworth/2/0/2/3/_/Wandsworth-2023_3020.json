",
    "Reason : 2 - INFORMATIVE: The proposed roof extension would not constitute permitted development as the zinc used for its external elevations would not match the existing dwelling contrary to the provisions of Schedule 2, Part 1, Class B, Condition B.2 a) of the of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 2015 (as amended).  In this respect, and for the avoidance of doubt, the Permitted Development Rights for Householders: Technical Guidance (DLUHC, 2019) document states that 'the face and sides of a dormer window should be finished using materials that give a similar visual appearance to existing house. So the materials used for facing a dormer should appear to be of similar colour and design to the materials used in the main roof of the house when viewed from ground level'. "
