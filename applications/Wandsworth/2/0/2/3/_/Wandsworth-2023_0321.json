    "Condition : 1 - INFORMATIVE: The proposed application does not provide sufficient information to ensure that the mast and equipment would not by reason of their scale, siting and design, constitute an incongruous addition that would result in an undue adverse impact on the visual amenity of the conservation area or the openness of the MOL. The equipment would likely constitute a safety hazard in the form of obstruction to the free flow of pedestrians given the reduction in the depth of the pavement and fails to provide sufficient information to ensure there would be no undue impact on the transport network.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the proposal currently fails to provide an acceptable siting and appearance contrary to Part 16 of the GPDO 2015 (as amended), NPPF (2021), the London Plan (2021), Policy IS3 of the Wandsworth Core Strategy (2016) and Policies DMS1, DMS2, DMO1; DMO4 and DMS9 of the Development Management Policies Document (2016).",
