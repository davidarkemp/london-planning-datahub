    "Reason : 1 - The proposed extract flue, by reason of its position, size and potential sound output, would result in noise disturbance to residential property to the detriment of the amenities afforded to occupants. Furthermore, the extract flue would be an unneighbourly form of development that would result in loss of outlook and increased sense of enclosure to the residential window it adjoins. As such, the proposal would be contrary to Policy LP2 of the Wandsworth Local Plan (2023).\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan (2023) as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
