    "Reason : 1 - The development would by reason of the removal of the original front boundary treatment, the introduction car parking and hardstanding cause unacceptable harm to the character and appearance of the Magdalen Park Conservation Area. \r\nThe proposal therefore fails to comply with policy LP3 of the Wandsworth Local Plan 2023 and the Housing SPD. \r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The development would by reason of the failure to meet minimum parking space dimensions would not provide adequate space to safely park a vehicle within the property boundaries. \r\nThe proposal therefore fails to comply with policy LP50 of the Wandsworth Local Plan 2023 and the Housing SPD.\r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
