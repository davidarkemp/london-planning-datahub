    "Reason : 1 - The submitted information does not include a programme for post-investigation assessment and subsequent analysis, publication & dissemination and deposition of resulting material in line with the Written Scheme of Investigation approved under 2018/5928. The proposal therefore fails to show that the archaeological remains that may exist on the site can be investigated in accordance with Council policy LP3 of the Wandsworth Local Plan (2023).\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan (2023) as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
