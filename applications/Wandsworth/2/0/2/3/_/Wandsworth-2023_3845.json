    "Reason : 1 - The proposed front extension, by reason of its siting, scale and design would\r\nconstitute an inappropriate and incongruous form of development that would\r\nvisually disrupt the architectural rhythm of the terrace and thereby relate poorly to the existing and neighbouring properties to the harm of the character and appearance of the streetscene. The proposal therefore fails to comply with policies LP1 and LP5 of the Wandsworth Local Plan (2023) and Housing SPD (2016).\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
