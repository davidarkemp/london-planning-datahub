    "Condition : 5 - Prior to occupation of the development the window in the side elevation at loft level of the development shall be obscure-glazed and non-opening (unless the parts of the window which can be opened are more than 1.7 metres above the floor of the room in which the window is installed).  The window shall so be maintained and retained as such. \r\nReason: To control overlooking and safeguard the privacy of neighbours in accordance with Council policy LP2 of the Wandsworth Local Plan (adopted August 2023) coupled with the requirements of the National Planning Policy Framework.\r\n",
