    "Reason : 1 - The proposed dwelling by reason of its location and its scale within part of an undeveloped residential garden would be an inappropriate form of development. The dwelling would form a prominent and incongruous feature that would result in a harmful impact to the character and appearance of the surrounding area, including the Glenburnie Road streetscene and the open rear garden setting of Beechcroft Road. As such the proposal would be contrary to policies LP1 and LP7 of the Wandsworth Local Plan (2023).",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan (2023) and Supplementary Planning documents as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
