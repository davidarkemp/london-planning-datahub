    "Reason : 1 - The proposed extension by reason of its scale and design would unbalance the existing building making the roof appear top-heavy, would be incongruous and out of character with the surrounding area. The proposal would have a harmful impact on the setting of the locally listed nos.109-115, the character and appearance of the Deodar Road Conservation Area, and the setting of Wandsworth Park. No heritage benefits have been identified to balance this harm. The proposal would be contrary to policies LP1, LP3 and LP5.\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
