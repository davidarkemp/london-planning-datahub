    "Reason : 1 - The development would involve the conversion of a property consisting of less than 130 square metres of habitable floorspace as originally constructed, which is not unsuitable for family accommodation. Furthermore, notwithstanding the objection in principle to the conversion of the dwelling, the proposal would also fail to provide a family sized unit with direct access to a dedicated rear garden. The development would therefore result in harm to the quality and mix of the local housing stock and be contrary to policy LP26 of the Wandsworth Local Plan (2023).\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The development by reason of size, internal arrangement and proposed level of occupancy would result in a poor standard of accommodation through failing to meet minimum floor space requirements for the residential units and habitable rooms. The proposal therefore fails to comply with Policy LP27 of the Wandsworth Local Plan (2023), policies D3 and D6 of the London Plan (2023) and the Wandsworth Housing  SPD (2016).",
    "Reason : 3 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
