    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development, by reason of its scale, appearance, materiality and location would provide an incongruous and discordant addition to the property which would result in harm to the character of the host building, the local spatial character and the Heaver Estate Conservation Area. The height and depth of the development would also lead to an unneighbourly sense of enclosure and loss of outlook to the detriment of neighbour amenity. The proposal therefore fails to comply with policies Policy IS3 of the Core Strategy (2016), policies DMS1, DMS2 and DMH5 of the DMPD (2016), policies LP1, LP2, LP3 and LP5 of the Local Plan Publication (Regulation 19) version with modifications (PVLP) (2023), the NPPF (2021) and Section 72(1) of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 along with the Housing SPD (2016) and the Heaver Estate Conservation Area Appraisal & Management Strategy (2010).",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the design of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
