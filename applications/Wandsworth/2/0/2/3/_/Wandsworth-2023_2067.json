    "Reason : 1 - By reason of its scale, height and siting, the proposed development would constitute an unsympathetic and incongruous form of development that overly dominate and compete with the original building. It would relate poorly to the neighbouring properties and harm local spatial character. The development would therefore be contrary to policies LP1 and LP5 of the Wandsworth Local Plan (2023) and the Wandsworth Housing SPD (2016).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed first floor front roof terrace, by reason of its design and location would result in harmful loss of privacy through actual and perceived overlooking and result in unacceptable levels of noise and disturbance to neighbouring properties. The proposal would therefore be contrary to policy LP2 of the Wandsworth Local Plan (2023).",
    "Reason : 3 - The application has failed to demonstrate adequate ceiling height for the flats. Accordingly, the development would result in substandard residential accommodation for occupiers and is contrary to policy LP27 of the Wandsworth Local Plan (2023) and the Technical Housing Standards - Nationally Describe Space Standard (2015).",
    "Reason : 4 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
