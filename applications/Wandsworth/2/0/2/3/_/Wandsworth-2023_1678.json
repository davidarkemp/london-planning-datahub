    "Reason : 1 - The proposal by reason of its siting, scale, massing, bulk and design would result in a highly visible, incongruous and over-dominant addition, which would relate poorly to the host and neighbouring properties. The proposal would be contrary to policies DMS1 and DMH5 of the Development Management Policies Document (2016), policies LP1 (The Design-led Approach) and LP5 (Residential Extensions and Alterations) of the Local Plan Publication (Regulation 19) version with modifications (2023), the guidance within the Housing Supplementary Planning Document (2016) and the NPPF (2021).\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
