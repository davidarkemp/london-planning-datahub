    "Reason : 1 - The proposal, by way of its inappropriate and incongruous overdevelopment of the site, would reduce the sense of openness and introduce an unacceptable degree of built form, negatively impacting the character of the house and the street. As such, it is in contravention of Policies LP1, LP2, and LP5 of The Local Plan (2023), as well as the Housing SPD (2016), and the NPPF (2023).",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
