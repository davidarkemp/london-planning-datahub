    "Reason : 1 - Provision A.4(7) of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended), requires that where any owner/occupier of any adjoin premises objects to a proposed development, the local planning authority must assess the impacts of the proposed development on the amenity impacts on neighbouring properties. \r\nOne objection has been received with regards to residential amenity and as such, the application was assessed against the Local Planning Authority's policies in regard to neighbour amenity. The development would, by reason of its overbearing scale and design, result in an increased sense of enclosure and loss of outlook for adjoining resident. The proposal therefore fails to comply with policy LP2 of the Wandsworth Local Plan (2023) and Wandsworth Housing SPD (2016).\r\n\r\n"
