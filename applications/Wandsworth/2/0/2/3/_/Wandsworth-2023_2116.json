    "Reason : 1 - By reason of its scale, design and siting it is considered that the proposed roof extension would overwhelm and dominant the appearance of the existing roof form and dwelling, whilst causing harm to the visual uniformity and appearance of the wider terrace. It is therefore considered that the proposed development would have an unacceptable impact on the character of the area, contrary to The London Plan; Local Plan Polices LP1, LP2 and LP5 and Wandsworth's Housing SPD.",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
