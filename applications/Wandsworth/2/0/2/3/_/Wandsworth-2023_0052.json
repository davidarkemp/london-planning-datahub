    "Reason : 1 - The development, by reason of its scale, bulk, and design, would constitute an unsympathetic and incongruous form of development that appears as an overdevelopment within its context. The proposed extension would relate poorly to, and cause harm to, the local spatial character of this back land location. The development would therefore fail to comply with Wandsworth's policies policies DMS1 and DMH5 of the DMPD (2016) , guidance within Wandsworth's Housing SPD (2016) and policies LP1 and LP5 of the Local Plan Publication (Regulation 19) Version (2023).\r\n\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposal would by reason of scale, design and location would constitute an unneighbourly form of development that would have a harmful impact on the amenity of the neighbouring occupiers in the form of loss daylight and sunlight, outlook, creating an increased sense of enclosure and noise and disturbance. The proposed extension would therefore be contrary to policy DMS1 (c) of Wandsworth's DMPD (2016) and guidance within Wandsworth's Housing SPD (2016), together with policy LP2 (b) of the Local Plan Publication (Regulation 19) Version (2023).\r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
