    "Reason : 1 - By reason of scale, design and siting, the proposal would constitute overly dominant and visually intrusive development, which would fail to respect the proportions of the host building and the open and spacious quality between the existing buildings fronting Thrale Road and Penwortham Road. The development would therefore result in harm to the character and appearance of the host property and Penwortham Road streetscene. Accordingly, the proposal fail to conform to policies LP1, LP5 and LP7 of the Wandsworth Local Plan (2023), and the guidance within the Housing SPD (2016).",
    "Reason : 2 - By reason of scale, design and siting, the proposal would result in an increased sense of enclosure and loss of outlook for neighbouring residential occupiers within the adjoining rear setting. Additionally, insufficient evidence has been submitted to ensure that the proposal would not result in a detrimental loss of daylight/sunlight to existing residents on site. Accordingly, the proposals fail to conform to policies LP1 and LP2 of the Wandsworth Local Plan (2023), and the guidance within the Housing SPD (2016).",
    "Reason : 3 - By reason of its layout, predominately single north-facing aspect and lack of external amenity space, the proposal would result in a substandard level of accommodation for future occupiers. Accordingly, the proposals fail to conform to policies LP2 and LP27 of the Wandsworth Local Plan (2023), and the guidance within the Housing SPD (2016).",
    "Reason : 4 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan and Supplementary Planning documents  as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
