    "Reason : 1 - The proposed alterations and extensions to the roof given their form, design and prominent siting would not be sympathetic to, and would compete and dominate with, the appearance of the host property and wider townscape, contrary the provisions of policies DMS1 and DMH5 of the Development Management Policies Document (adopted 2016).  ",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposed mansard roof is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation would not overcome the reasons for refusal."
