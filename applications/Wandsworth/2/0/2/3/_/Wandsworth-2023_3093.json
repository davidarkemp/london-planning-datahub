    "Reason : 1 - The proposal constitutes development under the Town and Country Planning Act 1990, and the local planning authority is not satisfied that, based on the drawings submitted as part of the application, this proposal falls within any class of 'permitted development' specified within Schedule 2 to the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).\r\n\r\nINFORMATIVE: Under the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended), it is not possible to consider the proposed first floor extension in isolation. The proposed total enlargement must be assessed as a whole and the drawings are of inadequate accuracy and detail in order of for a full assessment to be made. Notwithstanding this position, based on the submitted details it is evident that the proposed development would not comply with provision A.1(h), A.1(i), A.1(ja), A.3 (a) and A.3 (c) of Schedule 2, Part 1, Class A of The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended) as the total enlargement would extend more than 3m past the existing rear wall; the enlarged part of the dwelling house would be within 2 metres of the boundary, and the height of the eaves would exceed 3 metres; it has not been demonstrated that the materials of the ground floor element would be similar to the existing; and the enlargement would contain a roof that does not reflect the pitch of the original dwelling."
