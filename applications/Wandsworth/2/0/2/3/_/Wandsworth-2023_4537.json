    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development, by reason of its design and location, would be an unsympathetic addition which would result in less-than-substantial harm to the character and appearance of the host building and to the character, appearance and significance of the Magdalen Park Conservation Area. The application would fail to comply with paragraphs 205 and 208 of the NPPF (2023), section 72 (1) of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990, policy HC1 (C) of the London Plan (2021), locally adopted policies LP1, LP3 and LP5 of the Local Plan (2023) and Magdalen Park Conservation Area Appraisal.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
