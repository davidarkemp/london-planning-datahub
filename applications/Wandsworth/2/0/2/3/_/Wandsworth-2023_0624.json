  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed rear extension, by reason of its shape, bulk and siting, would be considered an inappropriate and incongruous addition to the original dwellinghouse and would cause undue harm to the character and appearance of the host property and the heritage significance of the Parkfields Conservation Area. The proposed extension at first floor level would contribute excessively to the dominance of the extensions made to the original dwellinghouse and would detract further from the original form and scale of the host property. Therefore, the scheme fails to be in accordance with the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990; policies DMS1, DMS2 and DMH5 of the Local Plan (DMPD) (2016); policy IS3 of the Local Plan (Core Strategy) (2016); policies LP1, LP2, LP3 and LP5 of the Local Plan Publication (Regulation 19) version; policies D3 and HC1 of the London Plan (2021); the Local Plan SPD 'Housing' (2016); and the Parkfields Conservation Area Appraisal and Management Strategy.",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
