    "Reason : 1 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal.",
    "Reason : 2 - The development would by reason of the introduction of railings at this level cause  unacceptable visual harm to the appearance and character of the building and of the terrace. Additionally, the increased potential for use of the flat roof as a terrace area which would impact on the existing amenities of nearby residents. \r\nThe proposal therefore fails to comply with policies LP1 and LP2 of the Wandsworth Local Plan (2023).\r\n\r\n"
