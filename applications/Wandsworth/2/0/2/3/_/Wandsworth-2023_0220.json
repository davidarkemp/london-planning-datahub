    "Reason : 1 - The proposal constitutes development under the Town and Country Planning Act 1990, and the local planning authority is not satisfied that, based on the drawings submitted as part of the application, this proposal falls within any class of 'permitted development' specified within Schedule 2 to the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).\r\nINFORMATIVE: The proposed development does not comply with the provisions of paragraphs B.1(b), d)(i) and B.2(c) of Class B of Part 1 of Schedule 2 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 2015 (as amended). The proposed development, together with the development permitted under planning ref. 2022/2214 as shown on the submitted drawings, would amount to 43.71m3 more than the cubic content of the original roof. The ridge is being raised above the highest part of the existing roof and the side window of the proposed rear roof extension above the two-storey back addition has not been identified as obscure-glazed and non-opening up to 1.7m from internal floor level.\r\n\r\n"
