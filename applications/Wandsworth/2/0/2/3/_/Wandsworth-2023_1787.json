    "Reason : 1 - The proposal as outlined is considered inappropriate in character and design, and unneighbourly in its impact on sunlight and outlook. It is not in accordance with policies LP1, LP2, LP3, & LP5 of the Local Plan (2023); and Section 72 (1) of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990, Policy HC1 (C) of the London Plan (2021) and paragraphs 199 and 202 of the NPPF (2021). It would cause overall harm to the street scene, neighbour amenity, and the wider Wandsworth Town Conservation Area, and is thus recommended for refusal.  \r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
