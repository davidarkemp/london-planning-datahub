The proposed development by reason of its size and siting would have an unacceptable impact upon the amenity of adjoining occupiers in terms of loss of outlook, daylight and sunlight and through an increased sense of overbearing and overshadowing.  ",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposal constitutes development under the Town and Country Planning Act 1990, and the local planning authority is not satisfied that, based on the drawings submitted as part of the application, this proposal falls within any class of 'permitted development' specified within Schedule 2 to the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).\r\nINFORMATIVE: The proposed development fails to comply with Schedule 2, Part 1, Class A, Condition A.4 paragraph 2 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended) as the development was begun before applying for prior approval.
