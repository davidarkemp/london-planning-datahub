  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - By reasons of its scale, design and siting the proposed development would appear incongruous and unsightly in its setting, dominating and overwhelming the adjacent low-level terraced housing. The proposed development would be defined as a mid-rise building, and is located outside a mid-rise building zone. It is therefore considered that the proposed development would cause signficant harm to the character of the area, contrary to Local Plan Policies: LP1, LP2 and LP and LP4. ",
    "Reason : 2 - By reason of inadequate information provided, the Local Planning Authority cannot be satisfied that the sequential test has been passed and that the proposed finished floor level of the development would be sufficiently above ground level. The Local Planning Authority therefore cannot be satisfied the proposal would not cause any undue flood risk, contrary to Local Plan Policy LP12 and the NPPF. ",
    "Reason : 3 - By reason of the proposed roof terraces being below the 10sqm that Policy LP27 of the Local Plan requires, it is considered that the proposed development would provide an inadequate standard of accommodation in detriment to residential amenity, contrary to Local Plan Policy LP27.",
    "Reason : 4 - By reason of inadequate space provided, it is not considered that the proposed development would provided adequate space for waste and recycling storage in the interests of the appearance of the development and public hygiene, contrary to Local Plan Policy LP2. ",
    "Reason : 5 - By reason of the proposed number of 1 person residential units (56% of the total number of units), it is considered that the proposed development would create an over-concentration of 1 bed units which would fail to achieve the policy aim of creating mixed and balanced communities, contrary to Local Plan Policy LP24.",
    "Reason : 6 - By reason of the scale and siting of the proposed roof terrace that would serve proposed apartment 104, it is considered that the proposed development would have an unacceptable impact on the privacy of neighbouring occupants, by way of overlooking, contrary to Local Plan Policy LP2. ",
    "Reason : 7 - By reason of inadequate information provided to justify the calculations contained within the submitted Viability Assessment and a failure to fund the Councils Independent Review of the document, the application fails to provide affordable housing on-site without independently reviewed justification, contrary to the requirements of London Plan Policy H5 and Local Plan Policy LP23. ",
    "Reason : 8 - By reason of a failure to provide evidence of adequate surveying having been undertaken, the Local Planning Authority cannot be satisfied that the development would not adversely impact on bat species and their habitat, contrary to Local Plan Policy LP55. ",
    "Reason : 9 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
