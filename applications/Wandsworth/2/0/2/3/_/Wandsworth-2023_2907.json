    "Reason : 1 - By reason of the design, size and level of occupancy, the development would result in substandard residential accommodation for occupiers as one bedroom to the front first floor and one bedroom to the front second floor fail to meet the minimum floorspace requirement for single bedrooms. In addition, the application has failed to demonstrate adequate level of daylight and outlook to the two second floor front bedrooms. Furthermore, the site is located in an area with a moderate public transport accessibility level of 3 which falls short of a PTAL of at least 4 as required by Policy LP29 A.4. Accordingly, the development is contrary to policies LP27 and LP29 of the WLP (2023).",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
