    "Reason : 1 - Conditions 2 and 3 of Prior approval application: 2023/3648 relate to refuse and cycle storage, which are considered to be matters which are reasonably related to the subject matter of the prior approval. As no information on these matters were provided with the original application, these conditions are considered to be necessary in order to make the development acceptable in planning terms. Conditions 2 and 3 are therefore considered to be necessary, reasonable, enforceable and precise, in accordance with Class MA and Section W of Part 3 of Schedule 2 of the General Permitted Development Order 2015 (as amended), as well as the NPPF paragraphs 2 and 56 and Local Plan (2023) Policies LP2 and LP51.",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan , Supplementary Planning documents as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
