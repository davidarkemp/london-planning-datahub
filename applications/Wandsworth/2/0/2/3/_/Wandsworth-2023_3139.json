    "Reason : 1 - By reason of their scale, design and location, the proposed roof additions, three storey side extension and roof terraces would constitute an unsympathetic and incongruous form of development that would compete with and dominate the existing property causing unacceptable harm to the character and appearance of the terrace and wider area. The development would therefore fail to comply with policies LP1 and LP5 of the Wandsworth Local Plan (2023) and the Housing SPD (2016).",
    "Reason : 2 - By reason of its scale, design and internal arrangement, the development would provide a poor standard of accommodation through inadequate sizing of residential units and restricted outlook to habitable rooms. In addition, the applicant has failed to demonstrate that the habitable rooms would receive satisfactory levels of daylight and sunlight. The proposal therefore fails to comply with Policy LP27 of the Wandsworth Local Plan (2023), policy D3 of the London Plan (2023),  the guidance within the Mayor of London's Housing Supplementary Planning Guidance (2023) and the Wandsworth Housing SPD (2016).",
    "Reason : 3 - By reason of their siting, scale and design, the proposed extensions and roof terraces would result in an unneighbourly form of development that harms the amenity of the neighbouring properties in the form of loss outlook, being overbearing, creating an increased sense of enclosure and reductions in daylight and sunlight. Furthermore, the use of the terraces would result in loss of privacy through overlooking and lead to noise disturbance. The proposal therefore fails to comply with policies LP2 of the Wandsworth Local Plan (2023) and the Wandsworth Housing SPD (2016).",
    "Reason : 4 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
