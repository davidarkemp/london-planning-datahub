    "Reason : 1 - Provision A.4(7) of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended), requires that where any owner/occupier of any adjoin premises objects to a proposed development, the local planning authority must assess the impacts of the proposed development on the amenity impacts on neighbouring properties. \r\nOne objection have been received with regards to residential amenity and as such, the application was assessed against the Local Planning Authority's policies in regard to neighbour amenity.\r\n\r\nThe proposed extension by reason of its depth and height would be an unneighbourly form of development that would be overbearing, result in an increased sense of enclosure and loss of outlook to the occupiers of No.54 Khartoum Road. Therefore, the proposal would be contrary to policy DMS1 of the DMPD (2016) and LP2 (b) of the PLVP (2023)."
