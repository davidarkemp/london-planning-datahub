    "Reason : 1 - By reason of its siting, scale and design, the proposed roof extension would result in an unneighbourly form of development that harms the amenity of a habitable room within the lower flat of No.3 Rush Hill Road, in the form of loss outlook, being overbearing, creating an increased sense of enclosure and reductions in daylight. The proposal therefore fails to comply with policy LP2 of the Wandsworth Local Plan (2023) and the Wandsworth Housing SPD (2016).\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
