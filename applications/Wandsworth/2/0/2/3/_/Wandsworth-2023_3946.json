    "Reason : 1 - The alterations to the front of the commercial unit in the form of removal of the shopfront and installation of fixed solid metal shutters are considered inappropriate as they represent visually obtrusive and incongruous additions and alterations that relate poorly to the host building. Furthermore, the shutters by reason of their coverage across the whole shopfront and visually impermeable nature would lack visual interest, failing to facilitate the establishment of an active frontage with visual integration between the host property and street scene. This would cause harm to the host property and detract from the character and appearance of Tooting Town Centre. The proposal therefore is contrary to policies LP1 and LP8 of the Wandsworth Local Plan (2023), and the guidance within the Shopfronts SPD (1988).  \r\n\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
