    "Reason : 1 - The proposal would result in the loss of a dwelling with less than 130sq.m existing habitable floor space (as originally constructed) and is not considered unsuitable for families. The proposal would therefore result in harm to the existing choice of housing stock within the borough and would fail to comply with LP26 of the Local Plan Publication (Regulation 19) version with modifications (PVLP) (2023) and Policy DMH2 of the Development Management Policies Document (2016).",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
