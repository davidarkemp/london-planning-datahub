    "Reason : 1 - By reason of their design and materials, the proposed replacement of timber sash windows with uPVC windows would result in harm to the character and appearance of the house, the street scene and Totterdown Fields Conservation Area.  The proposal would result in less than substantial harm that would not be outweighed by public benefits. The proposal therefore fails to comply with Section 72 (1) of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990, the NPPF (2021), policy HC1 (C) of the London Plan (2021) and policies LP1, LP3 and LP5 of the Wandsworth Local Plan (2023), Housing SPD (2016) and the Totterdown Fields Conservation Area Appraisal & Management Strategy. ",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably. In addition further guidance was offered to the applicant by the case officer during the processing of the application to identify amendments to address those elements of the scheme considered unacceptable. However, the necessary amendments to make the application acceptable are substantial and would materially change the development proposal.  You are therefore encouraged to consider submission of a fresh application incorporating the material amendments set out below which are necessary to make the scheme acceptable. \r\n\r\nRequired amendments:\r\n- Use of materials and dimensions to match existing.\r\n"
