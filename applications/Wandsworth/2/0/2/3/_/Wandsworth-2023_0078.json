  "description": "TPO 166/1991 - T7 Lime: Fell - Firstly in relation to the new class room provision there is only one tree which could be affected by the new building, namely Lime tree T7 which stands on ground outside the school boundary but within its ownership adjacent to Dents Road. Regardless of the planning ambition I have recorded the presence of Brittle Cinder Fungus - Kretzschmaria deusta at the base of the stem of the tree to the south side. Given the presence of this fungus and its form of decay, potentially leading to failure, it is recommended that this tree be removed as a matter of priority. Its removal will need to be agreed with the Tree officer at Wandsworth either through separate tree application or given the urgency, and if agreed, under a 5 day written notice. T8, T9, T10 (T6 on application) Limes x3: Repollard to previous knuckle points. G1 (T5 on application) Limes x4: Repollard to 7 meters, cut epicormic growth to stems. T24 (T4 on application) London Plane: Reduce to previous points to leave balanced offset canopy of approx 8 meters.",
