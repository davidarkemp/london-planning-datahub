    "Condition : 1 - This permission is for a limited period of 2 years expiring on 31st December 2025 and the building hereby permitted must be removed (and the land restored to its former condition) by or before 31st December 2025. \nReason: The building is of a temporary nature and is unsuitable for retention on a permanent basis, to comply with Section 72 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990.",
    "Condition : 2 - The development shall be carried out in accordance with the reports, specifications and drawings detailed (100 rev. C01; 101 rev. C01; Design and Access Statement ref. PTK-00-RP-A-001 P01).  \nReason: To ensure a satisfactory standard of development and to allow the local planning authority to review any potential changes to the scheme.",
    "Condition : 3 - The living green wall that has been installed along the south-eastern, northwestern and south-western elevations of the building shall be retained and shall be maintained in such a way that it remains in a healthy condition for the whole duration that the building is in place.  \nReason: To safeguard the visual appearance of the development and in the interest of the amenity of neighbouring occupiers and biodiversity, in accordance with local plan policies LP1; LP2 and LP55, coupled with the requirements of the National Planning Policy Framework.",
    "Condition : 4 - Within 2 months of the date of this permission an updated landscaping scheme for the grassed area adjacent to the temporary building shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority. This shall include details of additional soft landscaping including the species and height of any additional tree planting, shrubs, plants and seeding. The landscaping scheme shall be carried out in accordance with a programme agreed in writing with the local planning authority. For the avoidance of doubt if any existing tree currently planted on this grassed area is destroyed or dies then a replacement tree of a size and species to be agreed in writing by the local planning authority shall be planted in its place. \nReason: To ensure a satisfactory appearance, provide suitable tree planting and biodiversity improvements, in accordance with Council policies LP1, LP2 and LP56 of the Local Plan coupled with the requirements of the National Planning Policy Framework.",
    "Condition : 5 - INFORMATIVE: In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. The Council has made available detailed advice in the form of its statutory policies in the Local Plan (2023) as well as offering a full pre-application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably. In addition, where appropriate, further guidance was offered to the applicant during the processing of the application."
