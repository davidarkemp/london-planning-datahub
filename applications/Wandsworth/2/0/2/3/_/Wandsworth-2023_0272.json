    "Reason : 1 - The proposed internally illuminated advertisement would by reason of its height, size, prominent location and illumination would result in a visually intrusive and unsympathetic addition to the existing property and the streetscape to the detriment of the local visual amenity. Harm would be caused to the character and appearance the Clapham Junction Conservation Area and the host building. Additionally, due to the location, scale and illumination, the proposed advertisement would be an obtrusive, unneighbourly form of development that would result in harm to the amenity of neighbouring occupiers. The proposed signage is therefore contrary to policies DMS1, DMS2 and DMTS9 of the DMPD (2016), policies LP1, LP2, LP3 and LP9 of the Local Plan Publication (Regulation 19) version with modifications (PVLP) (2023), Section 72 (1) of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990, Policy HC1 (C) of the London Plan (2021) and the NPPF (2021).",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
