    "Reason : 1 - The proposed extension, by reason of its siting and design would constitute an inappropriate and insensitive alteration that would be prominent in the context of the site and not well integrated with the style of character of the property and its surroundings. The proposal would cause undue harm to the character and appearance of the dwelling, streetscene and heritage significance of the wider Dover House Estate Conservation Area contrary to the NPPF (2019), Policy IS3 of Council's Core Strategy (2016), policies DMS1, DMS2 and DMH5 of the Development Management Policies Document (2016), the Council's Housing SPD (2016) and Dover House Estate Conservation Area Appraisal and Management Strategy.",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
