    "Condition : 1 - The development hereby permitted shall be begun within 3 years from the date of this permission.\r\nReason: To prevent the accumulation of unimplemented planning permissions and to comply with Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended) and to meet the requirements of Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004 and to meet the requirements of The Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015.\r\n",
    "Condition : 2 - The development shall be carried out in accordance with drawings: Site Location Plan, Block/Site Plan, 01, 02, 03, 04, 05, 06, 07, 08, 09 REV A, 10.\r\nReason: To ensure a satisfactory standard of development and to allow the local planning authority to review any potential changes to the scheme. \r\n",
    "Condition : 3 - All external materials used in the construction of the development hereby approved shall match the type, texture, tone, colour, size and profile of those used on the existing building and shall be retained permanently. \r\nReason: In the interest of the appearance of the development and to safeguard visual amenity, in accordance with Council policy DMS1 of the Development Management Policies Document (adopted March 2016) coupled with the requirements of the National Planning Policy Framework 2019.",
    "Condition : 4 - INFORMATIVE: In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework 2019 to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application.  The Council has made available detailed advice in the form of its statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning Documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre-application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably. In addition, where appropriate, further guidance was offered to the applicant during the processing of the application.  ",
    "Condition : 5 - INFORMATIVE: This property is in an area known to host House sparrow\r\n(Passer domesticus) a species undergoing severe population decline. Nests\r\nare often placed in holes and crevices within buildings and as such they are\r\nvulnerable to construction and development work inadvertently destroying\r\nnests and nest sites. We recommend that any works including any preparatory work and/or scaffolding is undertaken outside the nesting season (FebAugust) to prevent breaches of the law with regard to nesting birds. We would also encourage the applicant to include provision for nest spaces within the redevelopment - further advice on this can be gained from the council's Biodiversity advisor by emailing biodiversity@enablelc.org.
