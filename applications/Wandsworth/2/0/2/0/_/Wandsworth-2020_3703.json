    "Reason : 1 - By reason of its design, siting, size and scale the extensions and alterations constitute a visually unsympathetic and discordant form of development. It fails to physically integrate appropriately with its surroundings and detracts from the local spatial character. Furthermore, the roof terrace constitutes an unneighbourly form of development resulting in harmful overlooking and associated loss of privacy to neighbouring properties. As such, the development fails to accord with policies DMS1 and DMH5 of the DMPD (2016) and the Council's Housing SPD.\n\n",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is a retrospective submnission and clearly contrary to our statutory policies.  "
