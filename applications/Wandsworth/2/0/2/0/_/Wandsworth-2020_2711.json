  "description": "T4 x1 Acacia spp Adjacent to site warden office Located adjacent to the site wardens office. This tree has had its root system undermined. It is a large tree and needs felling as a meter of safety and urgency in my opinion. T3 x1 Bay Laurus nobilis Rear of block near Car space 6 & 7 Re-reduce Bay tree overhanging the site boundary. Reduce long horizontal re-growth to shape by 1- 1.5m. Reduce re-grown side lateral branches by 1 m on its Northern side (Car park side). Re-reduce all lateral branches overhanging neighbouring boundary to shape on the Southern side T2 x1 Acacia spp Located in planter behind T1 This Acacia is over 50% dead. Sectional fell to ground level. Stump grind stool. T1 x1 Acacia spp Adjacent automated gate nearr front entrance This tree has some minor trunk damage (defects) from delivery vehiclular strikes. It leans out across the entrance way at an angle (Please see photos) there is some deadwood within the crown to be removed. The tree has been pollarded in the past. The client has requested we reduce the over hang back to reduce the weight and leverage. I recommend we retain the lower greenery and internal growth within the crown to create a new lower canopy form (using this internal growth as the basis for a new shape), reduce back the extended long laterals outside of this shape to suitable growth points (where possible) and pollard the remaining limbs without suitable growth points to a balance shape.",
