    "Reason : 1 - The development would result in the loss of usable Class A floorspace on the ground floor of two existing units, harming the vitality of the Putney Town Centre which is contrary to the aims of the NPPF (2019), Policy 4.7 of the London Plan, and the Council's development plan policies, in particular Policy DMTS3 of the Development Management Policies Document (2016).",
    "Reason : 2 - The development would provide a substandard quality of accommodation in terms of inadequate levels of daylight and sunlight, poor outlook undersized amenity space contrary to the aims of the NPPF (2019) and the Council's development plan policies, in particular Policy DMS1 and DMH4 of the Development Management Policies Document (2016).",
    "Reason : 3 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
