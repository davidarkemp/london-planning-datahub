  "description": "Front Garden: Fell and Treat Stump - Treat Ivy Stems at Base - T2 HAWTHORN: 1. The above tree works are proposed as a remedy to the differential foundation movement at the above address and to ensure the long-term stability of the building. 2. The above tree works are proposed to limit the extent and need for expensive and disruptive engineering repair works. 3. The above tree works are proposed to limit the duration of any claim period and, therefore, allow the landowner his right to the peaceful enjoyment of his property. 4. It is the case that an alternative to T2 Hawthorn such as pruning or significant pollarding of the trees, would not provide a reliable or sustainable remedy in this case. 5 We do not consider that any other potential means of mitigation, such as root barriers, would be effective or appropriate in the circumstances.",
