    "Reason : 1 - 1.\tThe proposed development, by reason of its scale, form, design and massing in close proximity to surrounding properties and private gardens, would be inappropriate in the context of the site, resulting in an overbearing, intrusive and unneighbourly form of development that would lead to significant harm to the existing living conditions of neighbouring residents, particularly those of Cobb Court and 93 Felsham Road, through loss of daylight/sunlight, outlook, overshadowing and increased sense of enclosure contrary to Development Plan policy, in particular, policy DMS1.  ",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed development, by reason of the existing constraints of the site, would fail to provide satisfactory alternative waste storage provision within the site for residents of the adjoining Cobb Court without compromising the living conditions and privacy of any future occupants of the proposed dwelling, contrary to Development Plan policy, in particular, policy DMS1.  ",
    "Reason : 3 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
