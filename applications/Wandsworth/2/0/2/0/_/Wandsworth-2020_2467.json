  "description": "Rear Garden:T1-London Plane Previously pollarded with extensive re-growth. Suggested works are to selectively thin out the re-growth at each knuckle, by pruning back to the previous points (3-4m from branch tips). Selecting one or two new leaders to be retained in an attempt to return to the tree's more natural shape over time. Retain shortened furnish growth for crown continuity. T2-Sycamore Prune overhanging lateral crown spread back to the boundary line and blend in with the tops, approximately 3-4m. T3-Silver Birch Reduce by 1-2m from branch tips all round",
