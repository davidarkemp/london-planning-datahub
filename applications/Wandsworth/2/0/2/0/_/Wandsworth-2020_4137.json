The change of use of the substantial part of the unit from retail (Class A1) to a dwelling (Class C3) would result in a harmful impact on the adequate provision of retail services within the local shopping frontage and the sustainability, vitality and vibrancy of the local shopping area. As such, prior approval is required and refused under Class M.2(1)(d)(i) and (ii), Part 3, Schedule 2 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 2015 (as amended). "
