    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development by reason of its design, materials and finish would result in an inappropriate and insensitive addition to the front boundary resulting in significant harm to the character and appearance of the property, the streetscene and the heritage significance of the conservation area. \r\nThe proposal therefore fails to comply with policies DMS1, DMS2 and DMH5 of the Development Management Policies Document (2016), NPPF 2019 and West Putney Conservation Area Appraisal and management strategy.\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably. In addition further guidance was offered to the applicant by the case officer during the processing of the application to identify amendments to address those elements of the scheme considered unacceptable. However, the necessary amendments to make the application acceptable are substantial and would materially change the development proposal. They would require further consultations to be undertaken prior to determination, which could not take place within the statutory determination period specified by the Department of Communities and Local Government. You are therefore encouraged to consider submission of a fresh application incorporating the material amendments set out below which are necessary to make the scheme acceptable. \r\n\r\nRequired amendments:\r\nThe principle of providing gates could be accepted, but the gates would need to be of a more traditional style with black iron bars and decorative finials allowing views through to the front garden.\r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - Enforcement action:\r\nFor the reasons set out above it is considered expedient and in the public interest to initiate formal enforcement action to secure removal of the unauthorised gates. This action may consist of issue of an enforcement notice and in the event of non-compliance, prosecution proceedings and the taking of direct action pursuant to sections 172, 178 and 179 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended).\r\n"
