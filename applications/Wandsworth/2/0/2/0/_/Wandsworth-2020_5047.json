    "Reason : 1 - The proposed mansard rear roof extension to the rear roofslope by reason of\r\nscale, siting and prominence from the public realm, would have a detrimental,\r\nunsympathetic and dominant impact upon the host dwelling thus failing to\r\npreserve the character and appearance of the Shaftesbury Park Estate\r\nConservation Area, contrary to the NPPF (2019), Section 72(1) of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990, policies DMS1, DMS2, and DMH5 of the Wandsworth DMPD (2016) as well as the guidance within the Housing SPD (2016) and the Shaftesbury Park Estate Conservation Area Appraisal and Management Strategy (2009).",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
