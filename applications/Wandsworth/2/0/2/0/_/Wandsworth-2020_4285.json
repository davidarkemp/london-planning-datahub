    "Reason : 1 - The proposal would result in the net loss of protected employment generating floorspace which fails to support, protect and intensify the borough's economy and that of London as a whole. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy EI1 (Encouraging sustainable economic growth) and EI3 (Protected employment land and premises) of the Wandsworth Local Plan Employment and Industry Document (2018), Policies E4 (Land for industry, logistics and services to support London's economic function) and E6 (Locally Significant Industrial Sites) of the London Plan 2021 and the NPPF 2021.\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed mix of self-contained residential units and non-self contained 'shared living' residential accommodation would result in the excessive provision of single occupancy and one bedroom residential units thus failing to achieve a mixed and balanced community. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy DMH3 (Unit mix in new housing) of the Wandsworth Local Plan -Development Management Policies Document (2016) and Policies PL5 (Provision of new homes) and IS5 (Achieving a mix of housing including affordable housing) of the Wandsworth Local Plan - Core Strategy (2016), Policy H10 (Housing size mix) of the London Plan 2021 and the NPPF 2021.\r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - In the absence of a completed S.106 planning obligation, to cover but not limited to affordable housing including early and late stage reviews and operational management plan, parking and highways improvements including contribution toward and exclusion from the controlled parking zone, public realm public access, reasonable endeavours to remove part of boundary wall with Battersea Reach development, workspace management plan and discounting of employment spaces, local employment contribution, carbon offset payment, future connection to District Heat Network, energy monitoring and contributions toward Arts and Culture and GP practices in the Wandsworth Primary Care Network with associated monitoring fees the proposal fails to meet the objectives of Policy IS7 (Planning obligations) of the Wandsworth Local Plan - Core Strategy (2016) and the Wandsworth Planning Obligations Supplementary Planning Document (2020).\r\n",
    "Reason : 4 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
