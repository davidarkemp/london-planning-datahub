    "Condition : 1 - The development hereby permitted shall be begun within 3 years from the date of this permission.\r\nReason: To prevent the accumulation of unimplemented planning permissions and to comply with Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended) and to meet the requirements of Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004 and to meet the requirements of The Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015.\r\n",
    "Condition : 2 - The development shall be carried out in accordance with the reports, specifications and drawings detailed [PL-01, PL-10, PL-14, PL-09 (Proposed Elevations REV C), PL-08\r (Proposed Plans REV C), Bat Scoping Report (Project no: P3930, dated: 20/10/ 2020), Planning Fire safety Strategy (relating to additional flat by conversion of the loft space at 44 Nightingale lane London SW12 8TN)]. \r\nReason: To ensure a satisfactory standard of development and to allow the local planning authority to review any potential changes to the scheme. \r\n",
    "Condition : 3 - No development shall take place until details and samples of materials proposed to be used on all external surfaces of the development shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority. The development shall be carried out in accordance with the approved materials and thereafter so retained. \r\nReason: In order to assess the suitability of the proposed materials, in the interests of the appearance of the locality, in accordance with Council policy DMS1 of the Development Management Policies Document (adopted March 2016) coupled with the requirements of the National Planning Policy Framework 2019. It is necessary for the condition to be discharged prior to the commencement of works to ensure suitable materials are used in the construction.\r\n",
    "Condition : 4 - The rooflights hereby approved, shall be of a conservation area specification i.e. in-line and flush within the roof pitch that they would be located.\r\nReason: In the interests of preserving the character and appearance of the conservation area in accordance with Council policies DMS1 and DMS2 of the Development Management Policies Document (adopted March 2016) and Section 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2012, \r\n",
    "Condition : 5 - Prior to commencement of above ground works (excluding demolition), details of the location, number and design of secure and covered cycle parking shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority.  The cycle parking shall be provided in accordance with the approved details prior to the occupation of the development and be retained for cycle parking purposes for the users of the development and for no other purpose.\r\nReason: To ensure adequate provision is made for cycle parking in accordance with Council policy DMT2 of the Development Management Policies Document (adopted March 2016) coupled with the requirements of the National Planning Policy Framework 2019.\r\n",
    "Condition : 6 - The development hereby approved shall achieve a minimum of a 19% reduction in CO2 emissions below the maximum threshold set in Building Regulations Part L 2013. Prior to first occupation of the development, evidence (e.g. photographs, copies of installation contracts and as-built worksheets prepared under SAP) shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority, to demonstrate that the development has achieved at least a 19% reduction in CO2 emissions below the maximum threshold set in Building Regulations Part L 2013.  The installed measures shall be retained in accordance with the approved details unless otherwise agreed by the local planning authority.\r\nReason: In the interest of sustainable development and to accord with Council policy DMS3 of the Development Management Policies Document (adopted March 2016) coupled with the requirements of the National Planning Policy Framework 2019.\r\n",
    "Condition : 7 - The development shall achieve a maximum water use of 105 litres per person per day (plus 5 litres for outside use) in line with the Water Efficiency Calculator for new dwellings from the Department of Communities and Local Government. Prior to first occupation, evidence to demonstrate that that the internal water consumption of the development will not exceed 105l/p/day must be submitted to the local planning authority and approved in writing, unless otherwise agreed in writing by the local planning authority. Measures integrated shall be retained for the lifetime of the development.\r\nReason: In the interest of sustainable development and to accord with Council policy DMS3 of the Development Management Policies Document (adopted March 2016) coupled with the requirements of the National Planning Policy Framework 2018.",
    "Condition : 8 - Prior to the commencement of above ground works (excluding demolition), details of the siting, design and materials of refuse and recycling storage to serve the development shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority. The refuse storage facilities shall be provided in accordance with the approved details prior to occupation of the development, and shall be retained thereafter.\r\nReason: In the interests of amenity and hygiene, in accordance with Council policy DMS1 of the Development Management Policies Document (adopted March 2016) coupled with the requirements of the National Planning Policy Framework 2019.\r\n",
    "Condition : 9 - INFORMATIVE: This application is in an area known to host house sparrow (Passer domesticus), a species undergoing national decline in its population.  This species often uses building for nesting, and works such as those proposed here can disturb such nesting activity and can therefore be detrimental to biodiversity unless appropriately timed. We recommend that works should be undertaken outside the bird nesting season (Feb-Sept inclusive). Where this is not possible, an ecologist should assess any built structures for active signs of nesting 48 hours prior to the commencement of works . In the event a nest is found an appropriate exclusion zone should be implemented around it until the young have fully fledged. Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 (as amended)  The law protects all wild bird species, their eggs and nests. We would welcome the inclusion of integrated nest terraces for sparrows within the extension. For further advice please contact the biodiversity team at Enable Leisure and Culture who provide biodiversity advice on behalf of the Council by email to biodiversity@enablelc.org.",
    "Condition : 10 - INFORMATIVE: In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework 2019 to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application.  The Council has made available detailed advice in the form of its statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning Documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre-application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably. In addition, where appropriate, further guidance was offered to the applicant during the processing of the application.  ",
    "Reason : 1 - By reason of its insensitive design, scale and siting, the proposed development would be an incongruous, unsympathetic and visually obtrusive addition to the original building. The proposal fails to physically integrate with the architectural integrity and appearance of the host property and would surroundings. The proposed development would detract from the local spatial character and fails to preserve the character and appearance of the Nightingale Lane Conservation Area. The proposed development would therefore be contrary to Section.72(1) of the Planning (LBCA) Act 1990, the NPPF (2019), the London Plan (2021), policies PL1 and IS3 of the Core Strategy (2016), policies DMS1, DMS2 and DMH5 of the Council's Development Management Policies Document (2016), the Supplementary Planning Document: Housing (2016) and the Nightingale Lane Conservation Area Appraisal & Management Strategy (2007).",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably. In addition further guidance was offered to the applicant by the case officer during the processing of the application to identify amendments to address those elements of the scheme considered unacceptable. However, the necessary amendments to make the application acceptable are substantial and would materially change the development proposal. They would require further consultations to be undertaken prior to determination, which could not take place within the statutory determination period specified by the Department of Communities and Local Government.
