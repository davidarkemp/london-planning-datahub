    "Reason : 1 - The proposed first floor side/rear extension, by reason of its style, scale, location and siting, would be an excessive and incongruous addition, which would result in undue vusal harm to the character and appearance of the host property and be visually intrusive in the streetscene and surrounding area. The proposal will fail to comply with policies DMS1 and DMH5 of the DMPD (2016) and SPD 'Housing' (2016).\r\n\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably. In addition further guidance was offered to the applicant by the case officer during the processing of the application to identify amendments to address those elements of the scheme considered unacceptable. However, the opportunity to amend the scheme has not been taken by the applicant and the material amendments, necessary to make the current scheme acceptable, were already carried out and approved under planning application ref. no. 2019/5099.\r\n\r\nThe required material amendments would include:\r\nRemoval of the proposed first floor side extension from the proposal and setting the proposed first floor rear extension from the flank elevation by minimum of one brick in order to appreviate the original envelope/form of the property.  ",
    "Reason : 3 - INFORMATIVE: The applicant is advised that this decision only concerns the extensions and external alterations and does not consider the change of use from existing 3 no. residential units to a single family dwelling as shown on submitted drawings. "
