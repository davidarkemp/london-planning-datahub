  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed public call box, by reason of its siting and appearance, would create an unnecessary obstruction of the public space, would result in the over-proliferation of telephone boxes and fail to minimise street clutter, as well as appear visually intrusive resulting harm to the setting of the nearby listed buildings. The proposal would create additional street clutter, which would hinder the convenient and safe passage of pedestrians in an area of limited footway width for the demands placed on it and restrict visbility to drivers exiting from Bickley Street. It would limit the scope of the Council's Tooting Town Centre pedestrian improvement scheme and efforts to increase walking levels in Tooting town centre and reduce pedestrian casualties. The proposal therefore fails to comply with the NPPF (2018), policies 6.10 and 7.5 of the London Plan (2016), policies  D7(I) and T2(d) of the draft London Plan (2017), policies PL3 and IS3 of the Wandsworth Core Strategy (2016) and policies DMS1, DMS2, DMS9 and DMT1 of the Development Management Policies Document (2016).\r\n\r\nThe applicant has failed to demonstrate that the proposed telephone box is required for the purpose of the operator's communications network and is therefore not in accordance with Class A, Part 16 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "Reason : 2 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
