Any fixture/ structure of the proposed development which overhangs the TLRN public highway would be subject to separate Section 177 licence application under the Highways Act 1980 to the Highways Operations Team in Road Network Management of TfL. The footway and carriageway on the A3220 Battersea Bridge Road must not be blocked during the installation of the signs. Temporary obstructions during the conversion must be kept to a minimum and should not encroach on the clear space needed to provide safe passage for pedestrians or obstruct the flow of traffic on the A3220 Battersea Bridge Road.  All vehicles associated with the installation of the signs must only park/ stop at permitted locations and within the time periods permitted by existing on-street restrictions. No skips or construction materials shall be kept on the footway or carriageway on the TLRN at any time. \r\n"
