    "Reason : 1 - The information provided within the submitted Flood Risk Assessment is insufficient for the purposes of providing a suitable basis for assessment to be made of the flood risks arising from the proposed development.  The proposal is therefore contrary to policies DMS5 and DMS7 of the Council's Development Management Policies Document (2016) and paragraphs 99 to 104 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2012).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed layout, being single aspect and located directly on the back edge of the pedestrian footway, fails to offer future occupants any respite from the noise and disturbance experienced by the use of the same footway resulting in demonstrable harm to their amenity. The proposal is therefore contrary to Wandsworth Policies DMS1 (General Development Principles) and DMH4(ii) (Residential Development Including Conversions) of the 2016 DMPD. ",
    "Reason : 3 - In dealing with this application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive manner and the Council has, as far as practicable, sought solutions to problems arising in relation to dealing with the planning application. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Local Plan consisting of the Core Strategy, Development Management Policies Document, Supplementary Planning documents and where appropriate the Site Specific Allocations Document as well as offering a full pre application advice service. Amendments were sought during the consideration of the application to address some of the issues.  However, we have been unable to seek solutions to problems as the principle of the proposal with the flood risk information submitted is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal within the statutory determination period specified by the Department of Communities and Local Government."
