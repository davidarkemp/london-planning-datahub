    "Condition : 2 - Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL):  From the information available, it appears that the development permitted is subject to a Community Infrastructure Levy charge in accordance with the Community Infrastructure Levy Regulations 2010 (as amended). You or the relevant interested parties are required to provide the Council with the information set out in the Regulations.  The process for the collection of CIL includes:\r\n\r\n- the requirement to complete an \"Assumption of Liability\" form as soon as possible;\r\n- to claim charitable exemption, social housing relief, self-build exemption or residential annex/extension exemption you or the relevant interested party must complete the correct claim form \r\nThe Council will issue a Liability Notice(s) which details the charges due.\r\nAs soon as the developer, landowner of other interested party(ies) is aware of the date when development is going to start they must also submit a \"Commencement Notice\". \r\nFailure to comply with the Regulations, including failure to complete the forms when required or providing inaccurate information can lead to surcharges, invalidate claims for relief or exemption from the charge, or other penalties as set out in the Regulations.\r\nGeneral information on the Community Infrastructure Levy, including the forms mentioned above can be found on the Planning Portal (www.planningportal.gov.uk).\r\nDetails of the Mayoral CIL can be found on the GLA and TfL websites (www.london.gov.uk and www.tfl.gov.uk).\r\n\r\nThe Assumption of Liability Form, Claiming of Exemption or Relief Forms and Commencement Notice must be sent to:\r\n\r\nCommunity Infrastructure Levy\r\nEnvironment and Community Services\r\nWandsworth Council\r\nTown Hall\r\nLondon\r\nSW18 2PU\r\n\r\ncil@wandsworth.gov.uk\r\n\r\nFax: 020 8871 6003 (marked FAO CIL)\r\n",
    "Condition : 3 - Any assessment of CIL liability by the Council has been based on the information provided.   Where the calculation of CIL liability includes taking account of the existing use of a building, CIL liability may change if the information provided in relation to the existing use(s) of buildings is not still current at the time of the decision which first permits development.  This date will be the latest date of either: the date of this permission; the approval of the last pre-commencement condition associated with a phase of a phased planning permission; or for a phase of an outline permission granted in phases the date of permission of the last reserved matter or pre-commencement condition associated with that phase."
