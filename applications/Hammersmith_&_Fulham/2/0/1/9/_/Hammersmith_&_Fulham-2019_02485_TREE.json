  "description": "Sketch plan: The tree is marked as (1) on the sketch plan.  \r\rDescription of works to be carried out: Full and complete removal of the tree and trunk. No new tree to be planted there after. \r\rReason for work: \r(1) Originally, we had applied for a crown reduction (reference: 2019/01075/tree) which the council had consented to. Post submitting our initial application we've had a landscaper visit our property and she informed us that the tree in question in our application is dying. Furthermore, its natural growth has been hindered by the neighbours (28 Harwood road) tree which was growing adjacent to it. With the neighbours tree taken down in the past month our tree looks even more out of place as it's crown is completely flattened on the left hand side. As a result we've decided we would like to remove it entirely.  \r(2) We are looking to renovate our garden and in order to do so we would need to remove the tree. It also blocks valuable sunlight to our garden and front of house. \r(3) The above provides low amenity value and detracts from the presentation our and the neighbours property",
