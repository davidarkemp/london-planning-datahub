The Ultra Low Emission Strategy must detail the remedial action and mitigation measures that will be implemented to protect receptors (e.g. design solutions). This Strategy must make a commitment to implement the mitigation measures that are required to reduce the exposure of poor air quality and to help mitigate the development's air pollution impacts, in particular the emissions of NOx and particulates from on-road vehicle transport by the use of Ultra Low Emission Zone (ULEZ) compliant Vehicles in accordance with the emissions hierarchy (1) Cargo bike (2) Electric Vehicle, (3) Hybrid (non-plug in) Electric Vehicle (HEV), (4) Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle (PHEV), (5) Alternative Fuel e.g. CNG, LPG. A monitoring report of the implementation of the ULES shall be submitted on annual basis to the LPA. Approved details shall be fully implemented prior to the occupation/use of the development and thereafter permanently retained and maintained.\"  Amendments sought are alterations to the shopfront and other minor alterations to facilitate occupation as a retail shop.",
