  "description": "T1 REAR Garden -\tRobinia - Large pocket of decay at the base of the tree.  Reduce all aspects of the crown by approx.1.5 metres past the previous pruning points whilst retaining as much furnishing growth as possible.  The idea here is to reduce the loading forces on the tree by taking some of the weight and sail off the branch ends. We would then advise regular tree inspections following these works.\t \rT2 REAR Garden - Eucalyptus\t- Re-reduce all aspects of the crown by approx. 2 metres back to the previous pruning points whilst retaining as much furnishing growth as possible. \t \rT3 REAR Garden - Rowan - Fell small, almost dead, leaning tree to ground level. \t \rT4 REAR Garden -\tRowan - Remove all dead and dying branches.  Reduce all aspects of the crown by approx. 1 - 1.5 metres. \t \rT5+ REAR Garden - T Lime x 2 - Remove all basal and stem growth.  - Reduce the height to approx. 2 - 2.5 metres below the previous and most recent pruning points. \r- Remove some lateral limbs to give a more upright and tidy shape.",
