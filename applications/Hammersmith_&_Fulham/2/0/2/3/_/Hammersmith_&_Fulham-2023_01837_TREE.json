  "description": "We planted 2 eucalyptus trees in our REAR GARDEN around 8 years ago. They are getting too big and have started to destroy our wooden flower bed. They are also too close to our house (2 meters away) which represents a danger for the house (and an issue for the insurance). We trimmed them a couple of time but they are regrowing too quickly. We also recently took advice from two arborists who advised us to fell the trees (and one of the two trees is weak as it did not grow properly).",
