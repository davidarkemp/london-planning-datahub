  "description": "T2 - REAR GARDEN -  Contorted Willow\rFell to a 2 metre monolith. T2 contorted willow is located in the middle of the rear garden. Tree is in decline and is being felled to the only growth point to allow it to attempt to regenerate.\rT3 - REAR GARDEN -  Dead Ash\rFell as close to ground level as possible. T3 Dead ash is located in the rear of the garden. Tree is dead.\rSee 2023/01870/TPO  for:\rT1 - REAR GARDEN - Ailanthus\rReduce crown to 1 metre below previous points. T1 alianthus is located at the side of the property. It is a large dominant tree in close proximity to the property. The works are part of a regular maintenance program to retain the tree at a suitable size for its location. It is the cause of an unreasonable amount of shade to the rear aspect of the property.",
