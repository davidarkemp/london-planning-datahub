  "description": "Dear Sir or Madam, we have recently purchased and moved into our new house on 15 Rumbold Road, SW62JA. \rIn our back garden, we have inherited a large  oak tree (REAR GARDEN) which is continuously infested with insects, it sheds non-stop, it is not pretty to look at by any means and is just a nuisance overall. We would like to remove this tree altogether and plat something more beautiful and more manageable in terms of shedding and dirt. \rThe existing tree itself is not covered by any conservation order as far as we are aware, however the tree surgeon who came to quote on the job said that because it is over 2 meters high, we still need to file an application for permission of removal. Hence why I am submitting this application. \rI believe this tree ads no value to us or any of our neighbours, and in fact is more of an eyesore and rubbish creator, than anything else. As such I believe there should be no objection whatsoever from any neighbour. \rI await to hear your response at your earliest convenience. \rThank you in advance for the consideration. \rBest regards, Iglika Ghouse",
