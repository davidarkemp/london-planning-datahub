The tree is now severely overgrown and is now hanging over our and a neighbouring property. I intend to hire a arborist to cut back and re-shape the tree. The crown will need to be lifted and cut back approximately 1 metre. The tree is forked into two equal trunks and a few branches will need to be removed on the left trunk.",
