Amendments include separated escape routes from above ground and below ground; ventilated lobbies to all corridors with sterilised Lift Lobbies housing no accommodation access; disabled Refuges within the lift lobby at basement and all upper levels. These changes result in some elevational changes which also include changes to location of rain water pipes.",
