  "description": "We are seeking to remove a mimosa tree situated next to the REAR wall of the property at 50a Comeragh Road. Apparently planted relatively recently by the previous inhabitants it has grown quickly and been left unattended. In a sheltered spot it greatly reduces the availability of natural light to our and surrounding properties. Mimosa is a short-lived tree with weak wood and as it grows will become more unstable. The trees produce thousands of seeds annually. Seedlings are often weak and weedy, and known as mimosa tree weeds. \rThe seeds can stay in the soil for many years and remain viable. These trees are invasive and establish in clumps of mimosa tree weeds.\rIts branches grow horizontally on the upper section of the trunk taking away more light from the area below.\rAs mimosa also propagate vegetatively management is more problematic. The tree produces sprouts around it that can grow into unsightly clumps, difficult to eradicate. This becomes more of a problem once it colonises an area.\rWe propose to cut the tree off at ground level and use a herbicide to prevent re-sprouting.\rOur neighbours at 52a Comeragh Road have also asked us to remove the tree as it denies light to their garden.\rWith the tree removed it will take away the chance of damage to people and property, which will become more likely if the tree is left in situ.  We will then be able to establish a broader variety of plants in borders, tubs and alike with the greater prevalence of daylight on the terrace below.",
