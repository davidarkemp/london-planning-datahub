  "description": "Rear garden - G1 containing T1 and T2 - Lime x 2 (Tilia spp) - outgrown location. Planted in raised bed, very close to the rear neighbouring wall.\rFell to ground level - poison stump and cap it, as causing cracks in surrounding walls, which have been cemented over recently. Could be sign of subsidence resulting from the roots of these lime trees. Damage (rain, sap and aphids) to AstroTurf beneath is extensive.\r\rSix months after stump has been poisoned, need to return to grind out the stump to a depth of 300mm. This may involve building a platform out of wooden pallets, to be assessed during fell\r\rPlant 3 x Himalayan birch, provision of compost and bone meal (to help root growth).",
