  "description": "Magnolia grandiflora x 2 - crown thin and reduce by 30% max (repeat of work for which permission was granted April 2017 - application reference 2017/01087/TREE). I am very sorry but I am unable to create a sketch plan on-line. LBH&F have confirmed they received a hard copy application with a sketch plan on 29/1/21 but I have been informed that, because of Covid, I must apply via the Planning Portal. Here is a description of the location of the trees: 6 St Peter's Square faces west. It is next to 5 St Peter's Square to the north and 6 St Peter's Square to the South. Its rear garden backs on to the gardens of the block of flats on the west side of Black Lion Lane and the garden of the end of terrace house to the south of the flats. Both trees are in the walled rear garden of 6 St Peter's Square. One is close to the wall on the north side (the boundary wall between the gardens of 5 and 6) approximately 6.5 metres from the back of the house. The other is close to the wall on the south side (the boundary wall between 6 and 7) approximately 2.5 metres from the end of the back extension.",
