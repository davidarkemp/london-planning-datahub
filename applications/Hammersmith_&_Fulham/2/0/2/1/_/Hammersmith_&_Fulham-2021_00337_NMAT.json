  "description": "Non-material amendment to planning permission reference: 2020/02754/FUL dated 21st December 2020 for the \"Erection of a single storey rear extension with a flat roof and a skylight, to the side of the existing back addition, replacing the existing single storey glazed side return extension and raising the existing party wall with No.58 Bishop's Road in glass; installation of new sliding doors to the rear elevation at ground floor level to replace the existing doors and window; excavation of the rear ground floor and garden to lower the existing level by 540mm; installation of a new timber front door with glazed panels to replace existing; and erection of a new brick-built front garden boundary with low level railings atop, to replace existing front garden wall.\"  Amendment sought is the raising of the party wall with no.58 in brick by 950mm, improving the rear elevation by making it rectangular, with the top of the rear elevation to be 3100mm off the existing ground floor level, which would bring it in line with the rear elevation of no.62, contributing to an aesthetically calmer transition between properties.",
