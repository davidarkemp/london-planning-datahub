  "description": "Removal of ivy trees, elm trees and palm tree on boundary wall of 35A/37. The location of the trees is causing privacy issues and making it difficult to create a fence on the boundary wall.\rThe removal is essential to provide privacy and to maintain boundary between the two properties. \rThe ivy trees are causing damage to the property of 35 with damp penetration through the walls. \rThe removal of the trees is essential to create the fencing.\rThe trees will be replaced with similar on the flower beds of 35A to preserve the natural environment and aesthetic the trees provide.",
