  "description": "Fell tree in our Front garden, which is a conifer tree started to grow a few years ago (T1). The tree has grown very fast and it has reached to the top of the two story house which is about 6-7 meters. Our neighbour complained that the tree is blocking the view from their first-floor window. We are also concerned that it might fall on the top of our house or on the road, and cause problems with people on the street as it moves a lot when it's windy.\r\rWe would also like to cut and remove another three in our front garden, which is a pink plumeria tree planed by the previous flat owner (T2). The tree is planted too close to the house. When it rains, rainwater from the tree goes to our exterior wall causing dump issues and damages. We don't have enough space to place our bins as many trees are planted in the front garden making our front garden looks unorganised.",
