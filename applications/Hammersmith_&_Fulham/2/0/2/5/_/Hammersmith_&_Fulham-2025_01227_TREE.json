  "description": "T1 rear garden: Prune crown by no more than 30%, min. crown spread of 10.8m dia. Remove dead wood, minor thinning works to improve light penetration where necessary, no more that 30% of crown removal at any single operation. Reduction pruning may be concentrated to provide more space for T2 and reduce light competition. Reduction cuts around most recent pruning points, and/or at suitable branch junctions.\rT2 rear garden: Crown thinning and removal of deadwood, reduction pruning, removal of all leaf area and woody tissue not to exceed 30% of total biomass. Removal of deadwood. Crown reduction will not exceed 4.55m (of remaining crown area), from a maximum reduction in 1.95 m in crown dia. Crown reduction will focus on the opposite side (North Western aspect of T2) to limit effects of pruning on photosynthetic capacity of the suppressed side of T2, and to maintain overall geometry of T2. Reduction cuts at previous pruning points, and/or at suitable branch junctions.",
