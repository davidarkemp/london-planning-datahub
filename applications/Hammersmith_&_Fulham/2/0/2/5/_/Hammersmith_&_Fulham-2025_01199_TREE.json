  "description": "T1 Magnolia, front garden - Unbalanced, distorted form resulting from past inappropriate pruning; Tight co-dominant union, a structural defect that predisposes the tree to mechanical failure, particularly under wind or snow load. This is compounded by the tree's proximity to built structures, which increases the risk of direct physical damage; Displacement and cracking observed in the adjacent retaining wall are consistent with root plate pressure or direct contact from limb extension; Obstructs light to ground-level and lower-ground areas of the residence, including the lightwell, which was designed to bring daylight into sub-street level living spaces. The entrance pathway is also encroached upon, impeding safe and reasonable access to the front door.\rOngoing cyclical pruning essential to mitigate further risk of structural failure and to restore safe access",
