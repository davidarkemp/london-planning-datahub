  "description": "We would like to trim the height and thickness of a large Leylandii tree (A) in the FRONT Garden of a property at 322 Goldhawk Road, London W6 0XF. The tree height and branches dominate the front garden and are unwieldy, thick and reduce the amount of daylight reaching the ground floor and 1st floor flats at this address. Having spoken with three potential arborist firms, we propose to reduce the crown height by at least 50% and also undertake some crown thinning. Please see sketch plan.",
