  "description": "I have a single large Lime tree in the Rear Garden of my property, 37 Cromwell Grove,W6 7RQ, and I am seeking approval to pollard this tree back to its original pollarding points. The tree requires pollarding every 3 years for two reasons: first, the health of the tree itself; and second, because the tree blocks out sunlight to my own and neighbouring gardens to an extent that is unreasonable and disruptive. I have owned the property since 2007, and have used professional tree surgeons to pollard this tree regularly (with appropriate permissions) and it is now due to be pollarded again (previous application September 2022). I am submitting as part of this application a sketch showing the position of the tree, its foliage and the negative impact on sunlight to neighbouring gardens. I have used this same sketch in successful applications for pollarding in the past. Thank you in advance.",
