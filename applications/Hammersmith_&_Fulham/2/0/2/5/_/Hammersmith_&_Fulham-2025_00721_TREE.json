  "description": "Dear Sir / Ma???am,\rI am writing to request permission to prune a total of four trees in the REAR Garden of 1 Wandon Road. \rThe reason for the pruning request is the tree???s overhanging branches pose a risk to safety and the tree???s growth following spring will obstruct clearance and sunlight. \rI am committed to ensuring that the pruning is carried out in compliance with any local guidelines, and I intend to use a qualified arborist to carry out the work. The pruning will be done carefully to maintain the overall health and shape of the tree while addressing the concerns raised.\rYou will find attached further in the application current images of the trees, and property floor plan.\rI kindly request your approval to proceed with this work. Should you require any further information or clarification, please do not hesitate to contact me.\rThank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to your response.\rYours sincerely,\rEkta Sharma",
