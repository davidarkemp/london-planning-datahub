  "description": "10045\tFell - due to poor structural condition of stem and suspected decline.\r10680\tFell - \tdue to poor physiological condition and evident decline. Remove in order to prevent failure on to footpath.\r10794\tPollard - to prevent failure of regrowth. Pollard points and congested regrowth is structurally suspect.\r10371\tCrown reduction - reduce height of stem leaning over footpath to a height of 5-6 m to manage crown at reduced dimensions.\r10706\tCrown reduction - reduce arching subdominant limb overhanging footpath by 1-2 m to minimise likelihood of failure due to cavity near bending point.\r10106\tRemove selected stem\t- Longitudinal cracking along SW stem near footpath. Remove stem.\r10376\tFell and treat stump to prevent regrowth, to protect structural integrity of flood protection bank at base.\r10050\tCrown reduction - reduce height of declining stem back to live wood.\r10317\tCrown lift - lift crown over seating area  by removing pendulous or small diameter branches, ensure at least 3m clearance from ground level.\r10006\tCrown reduction - Reduce height and lateral branch length by approximately 3m to relieve wind loading and minimise risk of either branch or stem failure and establish smaller crown. Final cuts to be at suitable growth points (<8cm diameter).\"\r10259\tFell selected stems - Remove cracked stems due to poor structural form of major branch junctions which will progressively become an issue with increasing branch weight in maturity. \r10833\tCrown reduction - Reduce height and branch length by approximately 1-2m to encourage development of a smaller crown, and minimise risk of branch failure due to localised decay pocket on stem. Final cuts to be made at suitable growth points, leaving furnishing growth to minimise visual impact.\"",
