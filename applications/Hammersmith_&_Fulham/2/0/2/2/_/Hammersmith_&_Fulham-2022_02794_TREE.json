  "description": "I am applying for two trees to be removed. I believe that both tree's are sycamore species. \rThe first tree labelled number 1. on the sketch plan is positioned in the REAR Garden on the fence boundary which is preventing fence panels being installed and securing the perimeter. The proposed works for this tree would need to be felled leaving a flat surface at ground level. \rThe second tree, labelled number 2. on the sketch plan is positioned in the FRONT Garden on the fence boundary and is growing over the neighbours garden causing excessive shading to both properties. The proposed works for this tree would need to be felled leaving a flat surface at ground level.\rThere is no proposal for planting replacement trees.",
