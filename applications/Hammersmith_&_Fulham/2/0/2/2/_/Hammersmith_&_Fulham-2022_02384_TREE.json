  "description": "T1 Magnolia fell - REAR Garden.\rReason:- Poor form, out grown garden and unsuitably positioned in garden, blocking out light especially to basement flat, nmagnolia has not responeded well to pruning and will not respond well to further pruning due to its growth charachteristics, the tree has not reached maturity and is unsuitable at maturity, it has also caused cracking in the retaining wall and lifting paving, whilst there is no arboriculturally evidence of this, the damage is clearly primary damage resulting from the tree even to a non expert. The garden will be relandscaped with new planting mitigating the loss of the tree.",
