  "description": "FRONT of property: T1 Sycamore x 1 (Acer Pseudoplantanus) This self-seeded twin stem tree is growing very close to the property and has outgrown its location severely blocking the light from the property. There is a high probability it will damage the property also. A reduction on this tree to improve the light and clear the property will leave the tree with zero amenity value. Suggested works: Fell to ground level by sectional take down using advanced rigging techniques. \rPoison stump to prevent re-growth.",
