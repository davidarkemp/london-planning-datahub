  "description": "Removal of the lime tree in the rear garden, close to the boundary of no.3 Cromwell Grove, and no.4 and 6 Melrose Gardens\r1-\tthe trunk has grown very large and it is starting to push the party wall separating no.1 and no.3 Cromwell Grove. \r2-\t2-in case of a natural disaster making the tree fall, it will cause significant damage to the buildings around \r3-\tThe lime tree is negatively impacting other trees in the garden, for example a magnolia, which is dying due to being under the shadow of the lime tree.\rMy preference would be to replace the lime tree by a cherry tree, or other tree that would be considered satisfactory by the Council.",
