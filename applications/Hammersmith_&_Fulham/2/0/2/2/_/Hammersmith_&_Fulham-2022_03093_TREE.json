  "description": "There are two trees located in the backyard of 35 Ellerby Street. One tree labelled as remaining and one tree labelled as being removed, which is centred in the back half of the rear of the garden. \r\rThe tree being removed is a Pear Tree\r\rProposed Works:\r\rClear the area around the base of the tree\rDue to the tree being located to the back of the property, it will be best to drop the tree towards the direction of the house \rSlim down the tree by removing the easily accessible branches.\rStart cutting at a 70 degree angle \rCut a wedge out of the tree???s trunk\rCut horizontally from the opposite side of the trunk until a small amount of the tree???s diameter remains. \rPush it in the direction of the wedge in the trunk\rAssess any services that may be running nearby the tree\rExpose and remove the smaller roots on the expanses \rExpose and remove the larger roots and dispose of the trunk",
