The Strategy must make a commitment to implement the mitigation measures that are required to reduce the exposure of poor air quality and to help mitigate the development's air pollution impacts, in particular emissions of NOx and particulates from on-road vehicle transport by the use of the Ultra Low Emission Vehicles in accordance with the emissions hierarchy (1) Cargo bike (2) Electric Vehicles (3) Alternative Fuel e.g. Hydrogen, CNG. The approved Low Emission Strategy shall be fully implemented within one month following the approval of these details by the LPA and shall thereafter be permanently retained and maintained.'",
