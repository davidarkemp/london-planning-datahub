  "description": "T1 Sycamore (Acer pseudoplatanus) front garden - fell this and it's saplings. Should be 17m from building as their tree roots travel up to 10m around the tree, this tree is 2m from foundations of 81 Sinclair Road. Roots have spread beyond the dripline, now underneath the slabs of the steps which could lift and be a danger. Roots have blocked outside drainage to 81A causing flooding, and impacting foundations of number 81. Past sycamores in this exact location have been removed. Creates a lot of mess, dense shade blocks any natural light to several properties, sticky pods, huge leaf fall, and leaves sap on the pavement and the two flights of steps to the lower ground properties of 81 and 79 making the steps very dangerous. Replace with a smaller specimen tree suitable for the space.\rT2 Pittosporum rear garden raised bed, growing up the boundary of 81 and 79. Outgrown its space, requires heavy pruning, thinning and shaping, as blocks the light of 5 flats. Complaints from the second floor flat of squirrels entering through their windows from the branches of the tree.\rT3 Horse Chestnut rear garden roots and trunk located in the fence. Size inappropriate for location, overshadowing property.\rFelling or pollard. Excessive shedding which become soggy and rot the wooden decking underneath it, which will have to be replaced. \rHorse chestnut trees in neighbouring gardens have been similarly pollarded or felled.",
