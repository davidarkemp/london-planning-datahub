  "description": "Group G1 - this is a large group of trees running along the foreshore of the club on the riverside. It is predominantly populated by tall, single stem poplars and willows. The roots are relatively shallow and have a lot of decay present as they constantly under water and are rooted into soft mud. There were numerous trees blown over in the recent storm, some which were resting on the retaining fence leading on to the river. There are also various deciduous trees such as sycamores and maples at the top of the bank that have grown too large for their location.\r\rWe would like to reduce the poplars and willows down to 6-8 meters in height to alleviate the weight and mechanical loading on the stems and root system. This will also prevent them falling onto the perimeter fence and causing it to fail. Some of them have been reduced in the past and will just be reduced back to previous points. \r\rThe various other trees on the foreshaw need to be reduced in height to circa 12 meters to maintain a suitable size for their location.\r\rThere are also various trees that are growing out of the retaining wall towards the river, these will be removed. The club have recently commissioned a survey from a specialist firm to determine the integrity of the retaining wall running along the clubs river boundary to assess the effectiveness of the flood defence. The report has found numerous weaknesses in the wall due to self-sown trees and vegetation which all needs to be removed before structural strengthening is undertaken.\r\rThe idea is to retain the trees to maintain screening from the flats and warehouses on the opposite side of the river.",
