  "description": "Removal of the lime tree in the rear garden. Tree is close to boundary of no.3 Cromwell Grove, and no.4 and 6 Melrose Gardens, and it has grown very large and tall.\r\rThe reason for applying to remove the tree is: \r1-\tthe trunk has grown very large and it is starting to push the party wall separating no.1 and no.3 Cromwell Grove. In the future the tree will push the boundary wall of Melrose Gardens as well.\r2-\t2-in case of a natural disaster making the tree fall, it will cause significant damage to the buildings around. I, with the owner of 3A Cromwell Grove, being greatly concerned. \r3-\tThe lime tree is negatively impacting other trees in the garden, for example a magnolia, which is dying due to being under the shadow of the lime tree.\r\rMy preference would be to replace the lime tree by a cherry tree, or other tree that would be considered satisfactory by the Council.",
