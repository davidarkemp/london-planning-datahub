  "description": "Tree, suspected Buddleia or similar, is growing in back corner of garden. Has grown such that it is now blocking out light to garden. Proposed works are to lift crown by cutting low hanging/broken branches, and reshape crown such that the original shape of the tree is reinstated and light allowed back into garden. For completeness, this is the same tree as in application no. 2022/02351/TREE, and I am in full support of the works detailed therein. Additional photos and sketches happily provided if required.",
