  "description": "There is only one tree (a field maple) in the REAR Garden at 174 Hammersmith Grove. The garden belongs to the basement flat, which I own. \rThe tree had not been pruned in many years and our neighbours have asked for it to be reduced in height so they get more light into their garden. We would therefore ask for permission for a whole crown reduction to a height of 6 m, in accordance with council guidance.",
