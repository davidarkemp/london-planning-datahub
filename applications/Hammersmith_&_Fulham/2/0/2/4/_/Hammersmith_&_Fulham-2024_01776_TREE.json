  "description": "We wish to remove a small holly tree/bush in FRONT of our house because it is blocking light to the front of our house (the kitchen).\rThere is only one tree in our front garden so it is easy to identify. It is a small holly tree, but we are giving notice out of an abundance of caution.\rI attach two plans showing the location of the tree. Our house is highlighted yellow; the approximate position of the tree is in orange.\rMy husband and I are the owners of the tree (it is in our front garden).\r",
