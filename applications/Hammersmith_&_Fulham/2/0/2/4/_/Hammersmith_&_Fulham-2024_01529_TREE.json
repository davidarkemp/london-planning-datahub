  "description": "Works to 62 trees - mainly Grey Poplars. Works are mainly repollarding trees to 5m to their original pollard points. \rAll subject trees are becoming dysfunctional at their extremities. All have overburdened primary primary branches and numerous large branch failures have occured in the last two years to many of them.\rThe accompaying work schedule identifies each tree and the intended works to it.\rThe reduction to 5m allows for regrowth that can be more easily managed, while also allowing for establishment of more suitable eventual replacement trees.",
