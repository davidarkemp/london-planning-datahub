  "description": "Non-Material Amendment to Reserved Matters Application (Ref: 2021/04010/RES) dated 14 July 2022 (as amended by Ref: 2023/01262/NMAT granted 7 December 2023; and Ref: 2023/03344/NMAT granted 7 March 2024) for the 'Reserved Matters Application relating to the approval of access; appearance; landscaping; layout and scale, in respect of Phase 3e and Phase 3f (Development Plot G1); for the erection of a building comprising residential floorspace with associated landscaping and play space, in compliance with Condition 1 (Reserved Matters Details), Condition 4 (Outline Component Drawings) and Condition 5 (Design Codes, Development Specification and Parameter Plans) of planning permission (ref: 2018/02100/COMB) dated 8 February 2019 (a comprehensive residential led mixed use redevelopment of the former Gasworks Site).' with amendments sought to Condition 1 (Drawings). \r\rProposed amendments have resulted from the need to provide access to two staircases from each upper level within Plot G1, as a result of current fire safety regulations and guidance. Amendments comprise: separated escape routes from above ground and below ground.; ventilated lobbies to all corridors with sterilised lift lobbies, housing no accommodation access.; disabled refuges at every core on every floor; alternative escape routes from Cores 1 and 2 via: interconnecting corridor on levels 02 to 09, additional stairs on level 01 to provide escape to level 00, and core 1 escape stairs extended from level 09 to level 10. \r\rThese proposed amendments respond to fire safety guidance have resulted in an amended mix and tenure within the affordable housing cores of Plot G1.",
