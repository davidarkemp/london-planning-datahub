  "description": "Deed of Variation of the Section 106 Agreement attached to planning permission (ref: 2017/03561/FUL) dated on 28 September 2018; seeking the amendment to Schedule 8 and Schedule 9; including definitions and clauses, to provide more flexibility, in relation to the Shared Ownership Units (allowing them to be offered as discounted market sale units) and the Affordable Rent Units (allowing different rent levels to be introduced to reflect the conditions of grant funding).\r\rThe proposed amendment seeks to rename the 'Shared Ownership Units' to 'Affordable Home Ownership Units' and amend the existing definition so as to allow the Council to make the 16 dwellings available either as Shared Ownership Units or as H&F Share Equity (which is a Discount Market Sale product) within Schedule 8, alongside amendments to the definition of 'Nomination Agreement', and removal of clauses 1.3, 2.1, and 3. Amendments are sought within Schedule 9, to the definition of the 'Affordable Rent Price', due to grant funding that may dictate a rent level that is different from that set, alongside amendments to the definition of 'Nomination Agreement', and removal of clauses 1.2, 1.5, and 2.1.2.",
