  "description": "This EIA Scoping Report constitutes a request for an EIA Scoping Opinion from the LBHF. EIA Scoping refers to the process of identifying those environmental aspects that may be significantly affected by the Proposed Development. In doing so, the potential for significant effects associated with each environmental aspect becomes clearly defined, resulting in the identification of issues to be addressed in the EIA.\r\rThe design of the Proposed Development is ongoing at the time of preparing this EIA Scoping Report, however it is anticipated to comprise the partial demolition of the existing building on-site, followed by the retrofit of the retained elements and construction of new a hotel and office and life science usage space. The Proposed Development will predominantly consist of high-quality life science enabled floorspace (Use Class E) and a upscale full service hotel (Use Class C1). The final designs and land use classes will be assessed in the EIA and the findings will be reported within the ES and each technical assessment.",
