  "description": "The tree under discussion is a mature syringa vulgaris (white) lilac located in the REAR Garden of 18 Blake Gardens, Fulham, London, SW6 4QB.\rThe tree was planted in the 1960s by the previous owner of the house. Originally the tree had a Rubens Montana clematis planted through it which had become very overgrown and was choking the tree. The clematis has now been removed, but the lilac has several dead branches and has become very misshapen as a result. The current application seeks to prune and reshape the tree removing the dead and rotting areas to restore it to health.\rThe tree is marked on the attached location plan numbered 1 Lilac Tree.\rAlso attached are three photographs of the tree. numbered Lilac tree 1,2,& 3.",
