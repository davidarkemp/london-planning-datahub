  "description": "REAR Garden - The tree is a magnolia tree that is about forty years old. It was already in the garden when my husband , David Pitlarge, acquired the property more than twenty years ago.\rOver the years I have taken good care of the tree and I have fed it regularly with the appropriate food. It flowers yearly from approximately the end of June to the end of September. The flowers are beautiful and appreciated by neighbours.\rHowever, the magnolia is now clearly overgrown and has lost its shape. I therefore would like to shape the crown ( cut about a meter and a half at the top of the tree).\rThe tree is situated at the end of my garden at the left side; its branches reach the garden of 3 Harwood Terrace and 18 Imperial Road. You can see it clearly using Google maps (from above).",
