  "description": "T10 Ash (Fraxinus excelsior)\rObs Bifurcated from 1.2m historic bark wounds to stem showing good wound wood development. Minor deadwood typical of species. Crown bias to E due to hard pruning away from adjacent building. Dense water shoots have developed on top of major limbs, sign of stress and possible infection. Historic wounds at 0.3m to NE and NW shows typical wound wood development and no visible decay of sapwood. Some deformation of foliage at branch tips. Minor deadwood \rWorks Reduce crown all round by around 2m height and 1.5m spread to N, E and S, pruning to suitable growth points/ junctions.To reduce target area should tree be infected with Ash dieback and maintain a more balanced crown. \rT8 (0826) Mulberry (Morus alba) \rObs  Stem leans to W, corrected in upper crown. Forms natural canopy over seating area. Ground is tarmac upto base of tree. Cavity formation at base of stem probed to 24 cm horizontally. Historic wounds show wound wood development. Large limb removed from west side of stem at 3m with some decay visible at wound. Long branches becoming low over seating area. \rWorks  Sympathetic crown reduction to West side of crown by upto 0.5m (previous points) to reduce end weight and help maintain balance. Lift crown to give 2.5m ground clearance all round and help reduce end weight of branches. Consider replacement of tarmac area with permeable surface to allow more water and nutrients to tree. Undertake resistograph decay detection at base of stem to better ascertain quantity of sound wood remaining. \rG1 4x Sycamore stems\rObs Young self set group, offers some screening from neighbours. One stem growing through fence/gated entrance adjacent. Growth starting to encroach over access road.\rWorks  Fell stem growing through metal fence adjacent. Prune growth back to edge of access road.\rT2 Sycamore (Acer pseudoplatanus)\rObs Minor deadwood typical of species. Low growth starting to obstruct delivery vehicles.\rWorks  Lift crown to give 5.5m ground clearanc",
