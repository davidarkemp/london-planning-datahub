  "description": "The tree in questions is a Holly Tree\rThe tree location is in the rear garden of 21 Iffley road and can be identified by the sketch attached and located within the circle labelled 'TREE TO TAKE DOWN'. \rThe proposed works are to remove the tree in it's entirety. Following a review of the tree and surrounding sight from a professional, it has been recommended that the remove is totally safe and non-invasive to neighbouring dwellings and that the tree should be reduced in hight gradually (until the stump is finally removed) over the course course of a two week period.",
