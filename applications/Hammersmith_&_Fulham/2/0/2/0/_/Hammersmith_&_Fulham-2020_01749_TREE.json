  "description": "Remove rear garden Rowan tree\r\rThe tree which we would like to cut down is a mature Rowan, which was planted pre 1988.  The foliage has become thinner over the years and is now very sparse.  Work, including pruning and crown reduction was carried out by  'Treecare' (www.treecare.co.uk) in 2005 and 2018.  Also in 2018, we noticed that a sizeable section of the tree, which was overhanging our neighbours' garden, was dying.  'Treecare' removed this section of the tree advising that the damage was caused by our neighbours garden being fully astroturfed.  This meant that the roots spreading under their garden were obtaining no nutrients, thereby causing the tree to die.  Treecare' s recommendation was to keep and eye on the tree to see how it fared - that it may or may not survive.\r\rAt the end of 2019, a large branch/section of the tree blew down in high winds.  This branch was about 4 - 4.5 metres long with a circumference of 68cm at it's widest point.  The branch straddled the fence between the gardens of 28 and 26 Greswell Street. Fortunately, no damage was caused to any property.  \r\rThe tree is now showing further evidence of cracks and we feel that it is time to remove it in order to avoid potential future accidents / damage to our and our neighbours gardens and property.\r\rWe would appreciate it I'd you could consider this application and allow us to have the tree removed before the Autumn, when there are more likely to be high winds and an increased chance of the tree coming down.\r\rWe intend to replace the Rowan by planting another Rowan, a Quince or most likely a Medlar (Mespilus Germanica Westerveld medlar). .the latter will not grow so high but will offer a degree of privacy and help the local bird-life.\r\rWe look forward to hearing from you in due course.\r\rPhotos are attached in the next section.",
