Demolition of an existing garage to facilitate works and enlarge the existing garden.\"  Amendments sought are the retention of the built single storey rear extension which has been constructed slightly larger, 2.64m in depth compared to the approved 2.5m, with the garden area still remaining at 50% of the original garden area as the light well has been constructed at a larger size than approved, and an enlarged side boundary wall to extend across the full depth of the side boundary.",
