    "Condition : 1 - The details of the facing materials to be used on the building shall not be otherwise than as shall have been submitted to and approved by the Council before any work is commenced on the relevant part of the development. These parts of the development shall not be carried out otherwise than in accordance with the details thus approved.\r\n\r\nReason: To safeguard the appearance of the premises and the character of the immediate area in accordance with the requirements of policies EN1 and EN13 [and EN31 if in a CA] of the London Borough of Camden Unitary Development Plan 2000.\r\n",
    "Condition : 2 - No development shall take place until full details of hard and soft landscaping and means of enclosure of all unbuilt, open areas have been submitted to and approved by the Council. Such details shall include details of landscaping and  boundary treatment to the forecourt to prevent the possibility of carparking on it. \r\n\r\nReason: To enable the Council to ensure a reasonable standard of visual amenity in the scheme in accordance with the requirements of policies EN15 and EN35 of the London Borough of Camden Unitary Development Plan 2000.\r\n",
    "Condition : 3 - All hard and soft landscaping works shall be carried out to a reasonable standard in accordance with the approved landscape details, prior to the occupation for the permitted use of the development or any phase of the development, whichever is the sooner. Any trees or areas of planting which, within a period of 5 years from the completion of the development, die, are removed or become seriously damaged or diseased, shall be replaced as soon as is reasonably possible and, in any case, by not later than the end of the following planting season, with others of similar size and species, unless the Council gives written consent to any variation.\r\n\r\nReason: To ensure that the landscaping is carried out within a reasonable period and to maintain a satisfactory standard of visual amenity in the scheme in accordance with the requirements of policies EN15 [and EN35 if in a CA] of the London Borough of Camden Unitary Development Plan 2000.\r\n",
    "Condition : 4 - All trees on the site, or parts of trees growing from adjoining sites, unless shown on the permitted drawings as being removed, shall be retained and protected from damage to the satisfaction of the Council for a period of at least 5 years following the completion of the development hereby approved, or such longer period as may be required under Sections 198 and 211 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990. In particular, details shall be submitted to the Council before works commence on site to demonstrate how the (specify tree/location) shall be protected during construction work: such details shall for instance include measures to protect the tree trunk, to prevent additional soil compaction around the root zone, and to reduce damage to the lower branches including any proposals for crown uplifting.\r\n\r\nReason: To ensure that the Council may be satisfied that the development will not have an adverse effect on existing trees and in order to maintain the character and amenities of the area in accordance with the requirements of policies EN61 [and EN35 if in a CA] of the London Borough of Camden Unitary Development Plan 2000.\r\n",
    "Condition : 5 - Notwithstanding the provisions of Article 3 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted  Development Order) 1995 or any Order revoking  and re-enacting that Order, no development within Part 1 (Classes A-H) and Part 2 (Classes A-C) of Schedule 2 of that Order shall be carried out without the grant of planning permission having first been obtained from the Council.\r\n\r\nReason: To safeguard the visual amenities of the area and to prevent over development of the site by controlling proposed extensions and alterations\r\nin order to ensure compliance with the requirements of policies EN1, EN13 and EN19 of the London Borough of Camden Unitary Development Plan 2000.\r\n",
    "Condition : 6 - No carparking shall be take place on the forecourt of the house hereby permitted.\r\n\r\nReason: To prevent parking on a substandard sized forecourt and thus to avoid obstruction of the surrounding streets and to safeguard amenities of adjacent premises, in accordance with the requirements of policy TR17 and standard DS8 of the London Borough of Camden Unitary Development Plan 2000.  \r\n"
