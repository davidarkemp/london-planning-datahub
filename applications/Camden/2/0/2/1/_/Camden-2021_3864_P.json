    "Reason : 1 - The proposed front and rear ground floor windows by reason of their siting, scale, and detailed design, would appear as visually obtrusive and incongruous on both elevations, harming the character and appearance of the host building, terrace and the wider conservation area. It is therefore contrary to policies D1 (design) and D2 (heritage) of the Camden Local Plan 2017.",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed rear roof terrace, by reason of its siting and scale, would result in potential close overlooking and loss of privacy to 4 Belsize Park Mews contrary to policy A1 (Managing the impact of development) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.",
