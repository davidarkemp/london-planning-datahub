  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The loss of the former taxi repair use, in the absence of any evidence to demonstrate that such a use or a similar employment use is not viable, results in the loss of appropriate employment for Camden residents. It is therefore contrary to policy E2 (Employment premises and sites) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.  \r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed car showroom would not be an appropriate replacement employment use nor an appropriate alternative use in the location as it is not a priority use as identified in the Local Plan.   It is therefore contrary to policies G1 (Delivery and location of growth), E2 (Employment premises and sites) and H1 (Maximising housing supply) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017. \r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed development, by way of its location, size, height and design, would be inappropriate in its siting and form, overly bulky and dominant in this corner location and harmful to the character and appearance of the townscape and adjacent streetscenes. It is therefore contrary to policy D1 (Design) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017. \r\n",
    "Reason : 4 - The proposed development does not include any larger sized 2 bedroom flats, as required in the Dwelling Size Priorities Table in the Local Plan, thus has an inadequate mix of unit sizes; it also includes one flat that fails to comply with the recommended minimum national housing space standards, thus provides an inadequate standard of accommodation. It is therefore contrary to policies H6 (Housing choice and mix) and H7 (Large and small homes) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017. \r\n",
    "Reason : 5 - The proposed development, by way of its size and siting to the front and rear of 2b Agar Grove, would result in a significant loss of outlook to the occupiers of this property. Additionally, in the absence of a Sunlight & Daylight Assessment to demonstrate otherwise, the proposed development, by way of its size and siting to the front and rear of 2b Agar Grove, would be likely to result in a significant loss of daylight to the occupiers of this property. It is therefore contrary to policy A1 (Managing the impacts of development) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017. \r\n",
    "Reason : 6 - The proposed development, by way of its inadequate on-site cycle parking facilities, would fail to promote the use of sustainable methods of transport. It is therefore contrary to policy T1 (Prioritising walking, cycling and public transport) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017. \r\n",
    "Reason : 7 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement securing a contribution towards affordable housing, would fail to ensure the provision of the required amount of affordable housing for the scheme. It is therefore contrary to policy H4 (Maximising the supply of affordable housing) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017. \r\n ",
    "Reason : 8 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement securing car-free housing, would be likely to contribute unacceptably to parking stress and congestion in the surrounding area and fail to encourage the use of sustainable modes of transport. It is therefore contrary to policies T1 (Prioritising walking, cycling and public transport) and T2 (parking and car-free development) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n",
    "Reason : 9 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement securing a Construction Management Plan (CMP), a CMP implementation support contribution and a Construction Impact Bond, would be likely to give rise to conflicts with other road users and be detrimental to the amenities of the area generally. It is therefore contrary to policies A1 (Managing the impacts of development) and T3 (Transport Infrastructure) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017. \r\n",
    "Reason : 10 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement securing a financial contribution towards the requisite highway works, would fail to mitigate the impact of the construction works on the adjacent public highway. It is therefore contrary to policies A1 (Managing the impact of development) and T3 (Transport Infrastructure) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n"
