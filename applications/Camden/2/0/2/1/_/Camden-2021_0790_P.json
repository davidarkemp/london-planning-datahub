    "Reason : 1 - The proposed monopole and its associated cabinets, by reason of their design, size, height and location, would be overly dominant in the streetscene and create visual clutter, which would detract from the character and appearance of the streetscene and adjacent Jeffrey's Street Conservation Area, would cause harm to the openness and character of the locally listed public open space (Camden Gardens) and to the settings of the adjacent groups of Grade II listed buildings (nos. 162-168 Camden Street and nos. 55-63 Kentish Town Road), contrary to policies A2 (Open space), A3 (Biodiversity), D1 (Design) and D2 (Heritage) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed monopole and its associated cabinets, by virtue of their design, size and location, would create unnecessary street clutter and reduce the amount of useable footway, causing harm to highway safety and hindering pedestrian movement, contrary to policies A1 (Managing the impact of development), C6 (Access for all) and T1 (Prioritising walking, cycling and public transport) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.
