    "Reason : 1 - The development, by reason of its height, bulk, mass and detailed design, would be detrimental to the appearance of the host property, the streetscape and the Fitzroy Square Conservation Area contrary to policies D1 (Design) and D2 (Heritage) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - In the absence of a daylight, sunlight and overshadowing assessment, the applicant has failed to demonstrate that the dwellings in the host property and in neighbouring buildings would receive acceptable levels of daylight and sunlight, contrary to policy A1 (Managing the impact of development) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - In the absence of a fire statement, the applicant has failed to demonstrate that fire safety matters as they relate to land use planning have been considered and incorporated into the planning application contrary to National Planning Practice Guidance and Policy D12 (Fire safety) of the London Plan 2021. \r\n",
    "Reason : 4 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement securing a Construction Management Plan, CMP implementation support contribution and Construction Impact Bond, would be likely to contribute unacceptably to traffic disruption, air pollution and be detrimental to general highway and pedestrian safety, contrary to Policies A1 (Managing the impact of development), CC4 (Air Quality) and DM1 (Delivery and monitoring) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n",
    "Reason : 5 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement to secure car-free housing, would be likely to promote the use of non-sustainable modes of transport and contribute to air pollution and congestion in the surrounding area and, contrary to Policies T2 (Parking and car-free development) and DM1 (Delivery and monitoring) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n",
    "Reason : 6 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement securing a contribution to affordable housing, would fail to meet the needs of households unable to access market housing, contrary to Policies H4 (Maximising the supply of affordable Housing) and DM1 (Delivery and monitoring) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n",
    "Reason : 7 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement securing a contribution to secure two long stay cycling spaces, would fail to promote sustainable transport choices contrary to Policies T1 (Parking and car-free development) and DM1 (Delivery and monitoring) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n"
