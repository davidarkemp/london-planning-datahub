Should it prove necessary to undertake demolition or clearance works during the bird nesting season, then a pre-works check for nesting birds should be undertaken by a qualified ecologist. If any active nests are found, works should cease and an appropriate buffer zone should be established (the qualified ecologist would advise). This buffer zone should be left intact until it has been confirmed that the young have fledged and the nest is no longer in use.  \n   \nReason: In order to conserve and enhance wildlife habitats and biodiversity measures within the development, in accordance with the requirements of policies A3 and CC2 of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.\n",

Such details shall include details of replacement planting and post planting maintenance, earthworks including grading, mounding and other changes in ground levels. The relevant part of the works shall not be carried out otherwise than in accordance with the details thus approved.\n\nReason: To ensure that the development achieves a high quality of landscaping which contributes to the visual amenity and character of the area in accordance with the requirements of policies A2 and A3 of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.\n",
