  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed building's design by reason of its incoherent fa�ade composition and materials which lack any cohesion with or reference to context, would appear incongruous in its setting and would harm the local pattern of development, to the detriment of the character and appearance of the�Camden Town Conservation Area, contrary to policies D1 (Design) and D2 (Heritage) of the Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The application fails to demonstrate that the habitable rooms would receive acceptable levels of daylight and sunlight to provide an acceptable quality of living accommodation for the prospective occupiers, contrary to policies D1 (Design) and A1 (Managing the impact of development) of the Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed dwellings by reason of their single aspect outlook onto a concreted service yard would provide an unacceptable quality of living accommodation for the prospective occupiers, contrary to policies D1 (Design) and A1 (Managing the impact of development) of the Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n",
    "Reason : 4 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement securing an affordable housing contribution, would fail to maximise the supply of affordable housing to meet the needs of households unable to access market housing, contrary to policy H4 (Maximising the supply of affordable housing) of the Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
    "Reason : 5 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement securing car-free housing and a landscaping plan to prevent car parking to the forecourt area, would be likely to contribute unacceptably to parking stress and congestion in the surrounding area and fail to promote more sustainable and efficient forms of transport and active lifestyles, contrary to policies T2 (Parking and car-free development) and DM1 (Delivery and monitoring) of the Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n",
    "Reason : 6 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement securing a Construction Management Plan (CMP) and associated contributions to support the implementation of the CMP, would be likely to give rise to conflicts with other road users and be detrimental to the amenities of the area generally, contrary to policies A1 (Managing the impact of development), T4 (Sustainable movement of goods and materials) and DM1 (Delivery and monitoring) of the Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n",
    "Reason : 7 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement securing the proposed energy efficiency measures would fail to comply with the carbon reduction targets of Part L1B of Building Regulations, and would therefore fail to ensure proper standards of sustainability in the development, contrary to policy CC1 (Climate change mitigation) of the Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n\r\n"
