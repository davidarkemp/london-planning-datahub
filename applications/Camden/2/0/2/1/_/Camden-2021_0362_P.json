    "Condition : 1 - The development hereby permitted must be begun not later than the end of three years from the date of this permission.\r\n\r\nReason: In order to comply with the provisions of Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended).\r\n",
    "Condition : 2 - The 1st floor roof shall only be used as a terrace for amenity purposes within the area identified as 'terrace' on the approved drawings. \r\n\r\nThe use of the roof as a terrace shall not commence until the balustrade and screen, as shown on the approved drawings, have been constructed. Both shall be retained thereafter for as long as the roof provides an amenity use. \r\n\r\nReason: In order to prevent unreasonable overlooking of neighbouring premises in accordance with the requirements of policies A1 and D1 of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017. \r\n",
    "Condition : 3 - The development hereby permitted shall be carried out in accordance with the following approved plans: \r\n\r\nSite Location Plan. Drawing Prefix LW202000115-: 02 rev 101221 (First FL and Second FL Plans), 04 rev 101221 (Elevations), 05 rev 101221 (Side Elevation), 06 rev 101221 (Section A-A).\r\n\r\nReason: For the avoidance of doubt and in the interest of proper planning.\r\n",
    "Condition : 4 - All new external work shall be carried out in materials that resemble, as closely as possible, in colour and texture those of the existing building, unless otherwise specified in the approved application. In particular, the proposed door at 1st floor shall be timber framed. \r\n\r\nReason: To safeguard the appearance of the premises and the character of the immediate area in accordance with the requirements of policies D1 and D2 of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017. \r\n",
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed second floor balustrade enclosure, by reason of its size, design and location along the rear elevation would result in a harmful impact to the visual amenity and the character and appearance of the host building, and the Camden Square Conservation Area, and D1 (Design) and D2 (Heritage) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed rear elevation roof terrace, by reason of its size, depth, and location along the boundary wall with No.7 Fitzroy Road, would give rise to significant overlooking impact, resulting in significant harm to the residential amenity of neighbouring properties, contrary to policies A1 (Amenity) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017."
