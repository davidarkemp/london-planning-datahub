    "Condition : 3 - All new external work shall be carried out in materials that resemble, as closely as possible, in colour and texture those of the existing building, unless otherwise specified in the approved application. \r\n\r\nReason: To safeguard the appearance of the premises and the character of the immediate area in accordance with the requirements of policy D1 and D2  of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017. \r\n",
    "Condition : 4 - Prior to the commencement of works on site, tree protection measures shall be installed and working practices adopted in accordance with the Arboricultural Method Statement ref.

Works shall not recommence until an appropriate remediation scheme has been submitted to, and approved in writing by, the local planning authority and the remediation has been completed. Upon completion of the building works, this condition shall not be discharged until a closure report has been submitted to, and improved in writing by, the local planning authority.\r\n\r\nReason: To ensure the risks from land contamination to the future users of the land and neighbouring land are minimised, together with those to controlled waters, property and ecological systems, and to ensure that the development can be carried out safely without unacceptable risks to workers, neighbours and other offsite receptors, in accordance with policies G1, D1, A1, and DM1 of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.

    "Condition : 6 - Noise levels at a point 1 metre external to sensitive facades shall be at least 10dB(A) less than the existing background measurement (LA90), expressed in dB(A) when all plant/equipment (or any part of it) is in operation unless the plant/equipment hereby permitted will have a noise that has a distinguishable, discrete continuous note (whine, hiss, screech, hum) and/or if there are distinct impulses (bangs, clicks, clatters, thumps), then the noise levels from that piece of plant/equipment at any sensitive faï¿½ade shall be at least 15dB(A) below the LA90, expressed in dB(A). \r\n\r\nReason: To safeguard the amenities of the adjoining premises and the area generally in accordance with the requirements of policies A1 and A4 of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n",
    "Condition : 7 - The development hereby approved shall not commence until such time as a suitably qualified chartered engineer with membership of the appropriate professional body has been appointed to inspect, approve and monitor the critical elements of both permanent and temporary basement construction works throughout their duration to ensure compliance with the design which has been checked and approved by a building control body. Details of the appointment and the appointee's responsibilities shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority prior to the commencement of development. Any subsequent change or reappointment shall be confirmed forthwith for the duration of the construction works. \r\n\r\nReason:  To safeguard the appearance and structural stability of neighbouring buildings and the character of the immediate area in accordance with the requirements of  policies D1, D2 and A5 of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017. \r\n"
