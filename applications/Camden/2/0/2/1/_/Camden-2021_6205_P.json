  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed single storey extension, due to its bulk, scale, siting, design, would result in an incongruous addition to the building, which would detract from the form, style and character of the original building, the terrace row and the wider built environment, which reduces the garden amenity space, contrary to policy D1 (Design) of the Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed single storey rear extension, due to its bulk, scale and rear projection, would result in an overbearing development with unacceptable sense of enclosure, detrimental to the amenity of neighbouring occupiers at no. 30 Hartland Road in terms of loss of light and outlook, contrary to policy A1 (Managing the impact of development) of the Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed terrace on the roof of the main dwelling, due to its location and lack of secure balustrading and detailed design, would result in an unsafe and inaccessible terrace at high level, contrary to policy D1 (Design) of the Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n"
