    "Condition : 1 - The development hereby permitted must be begun not later than the end of three years from the date of this permission.\r\n\r\nReason: In order to comply with the provisions of Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended).\r\n\r\n",
    "Condition : 2 - The development hereby permitted shall be carried out in accordance with the following approved plans: 330-OS-001-001, 330-E-001-000, 330-E-002-000, 330-E-003-000, 330-E-004-000, 330-E-005-000, 330-E-010-000, 330-E-020-000, 330-PE-001-007, 330-PE-002-004, 330-PE-003-004, 300-PE-004-06, 300-PE-020-008, Fire Statement Revision 000, Arboricultural Method Statement ref. ASIAMS149.3 dated 3rd August 2022 and Tree Protection Plan rev. A dated August 2022.\r\n\r\nReason: For the avoidance of doubt and in the interest of proper planning.\r\n",
    "Condition : 3 - All new external work shall be carried out in materials that resemble, as closely as possible, in colour and texture those of the existing building, unless otherwise specified in the approved application. \r\n\r\nReason: To safeguard the appearance of the premises and the character of the immediate area in accordance with the requirements of policy D1 and D2  of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017. \r\n",
    "Condition : 4 - Prior to occupation of the extension hereby permitted, all glazing to the side elevation (which face towards no 30 Crediton Hill) shall be fitted with obscure glazing to a height of 1.8m internally and shall be permanently retained and maintained as such thereafter.   \r\n\r\nReason: In order to prevent unreasonable overlooking of neighbouring premises in accordance with the requirements of policy A1 of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n",
    "Condition : 5 - Prior to the commencement of works on site, tree protection measures shall be installed and working practices adopted in accordance with the Arboricultural Method Statement ref. ASIAMS149.3 dated 3rd August 2022 and Tree Protection Plan rev. A dated August 2022 by Reeves Arboricultural Services. All trees on the site, or parts of trees growing from adjoining sites, unless shown on the permitted drawings as being removed, shall be retained and protected from damage in accordance with BS5837:2012 and with the approved protection details. The development shall be monitored by the project arboriculturalist in accordance with the approved report.\r\n\r\nReason: To ensure that the development will not have an adverse effect on existing trees and in order to maintain the character and amenity of the area in accordance with the requirements of policies A2 and A3 of the Camden Local Plan.\r\n",
    "Condition : 6 - Regarding Land Contamination Risk Assessment \r\n\r\nPart A:  No development shall commence until a site investigation is undertaken and the findings are submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority.  The site investigation should assess all potential risks identified by the desktop study and should include a generic quantitative risk assessment and a revised conceptual site model. The assessment must encompass an assessment of risks posed by radon and by ground gas. All works must be carried out in compliance with CLRM (2020) and by a competent person.\r\n\r\nPart B:  No development shall commence until a remediation method statement (RMS) is submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority. This statement shall detail any required remediation works and shall be designed to mitigate any remaining risks identified in the approved quantitative risk assessment. This document should include a strategy for dealing with previously undiscovered contamination. All works must be carried out in compliance with CLRM (2020) and by a competent person. \r\n\r\nPart C: Following the completion of any remediation, a verification report demonstrating that the remediation as outlined in the RMS have been completed should be submitted to, and approved in writing, by the local planning authority. This report shall include (but may not be limited to): details of the remediation works carried out, results of any verification sampling, testing or monitoring including the analysis of any imported soil and waste management documentation. All works must be carried out in compliance with CLRM (2020) and by a competent person. \r\n\r\nReason: To ensure the risks from land contamination to the future users of the land and neighbouring land are minimised, together with those to controlled waters, property and ecological systems, and to ensure that the development can be carried out safely without unacceptable risks to workers, neighbours and other offsite receptors, "
