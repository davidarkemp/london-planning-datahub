  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed rooftop extension, by reason of the proposed height, mass, detailed design and materials would compromise the form, character and appearance of the host building and this part of the Seven Dials Conservation Area, contrary to policy D1 (Design) and D2 (Heritage) of the Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - In the absence of an air quality assessment, it has not been adequately demonstrated that future occupants would be protected from exposure to poor air quality, contrary to policy CC4 (Air quality) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed development would not achieve required carbon reduction targets, and as such would not minimise the effects of climate change or meet the highest feasible environmental standards, contrary to policy CC1 (Climate change mitigation) and CC2 (Adapting to climate change) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n",
    "Reason : 4 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement to secure a contribution to affordable housing, would fail to maximise the contribution of the site to the supply of affordable housing in the borough, contrary to policy H4 (Maximising the supply of affordable housing) of the Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n",
    "Reason : 5 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement securing car-free housing, would be likely to contribute unacceptably to parking stress and congestion in the surrounding area and fail to promote more sustainable and efficient forms of transport and active lifestyles, contrary to policies T2 (Parking and car-free development) and DM1 (Delivery and monitoring) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n",
    "Reason : 6 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement to secure a construction management plan and appropriate financial contributions towards implementation support, would be likely to give rise to conflicts with other road users and be detrimental to the amenities of the area generally, contrary to policies G1 (Delivery and location of growth), A1 (Managing the impact of development), T3 (Transport Infrastructure), T4 (Sustainable movement of goods and materials), DM1 (Delivery and monitoring), A4 (Noise and Vibration) and CC4 (Air quality) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017. \r\n"
