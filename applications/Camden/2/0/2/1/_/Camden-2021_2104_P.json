    "Reason : 2 - The proposed telephone kiosk, by virtue of its location, size and detailed design, adding to  unnecessary street clutter, would reduce the amount of useable, unobstructed footway, which would be detrimental to the quality of the public realm, cause harm to highway safety and hinder pedestrian movement and have a detrimental impact on the promotion of walking as an alternative to motorised transport, contrary to policies G1 (Delivery and location of growth), A1 (Managing the impact of development), C6 (Access for all) and T1 (Prioritising walking, cycling and public transport) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed telephone kiosk, adding unnecessary street clutter, would create  increased opportunities for crime in an area which already experiences issues with crime, therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policy C5 of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.",
    "Reason : 4 - In absence of a legal agreement to secure the secure the removal of the existing kiosk and others in the vicinity and a maintenance plan would be detrimental to the quality of the public realm, and detract from the character and appearance of the conservation area, contrary to policies D1 (Design), D2 (Heritage), G1 (Delivery and location of growth), A1 (Managing the impact of development), C6 (Access for all) and T1 (Prioritising walking, cycling and public transport) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017."
