    "Reason : 1 - The proposed dormer extension, new skylight and glazed balustrades and front rooflights, by way of their size, siting, design, materials and appearance, would detract from the form and character of the building, the quality of the townscape, the uniformity of the terrace, and the character and appearance of the Conservation Area.  The proposal is therefore contrary to policies D1 (Design) and D2 (Heritage) of the LB Camden Local Plan 2017, the London Plan 2021 and the NPPF 2021.",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed terrace on the roof and the balcony/terrace at third floor level would result in direct overlooking of adjoining rooms and gardens at nos. 16 and 18 Jeffrey's Place and 12, 14 and 16 Jeffrey's Street.  The development would therefore result in a loss of privacy for neighbouring occupiers contrary to policy A1 (Managing the impacts of development) of the LB Camden Local Plan 2017, the London Plan 2021 and the NPPF 2021."
