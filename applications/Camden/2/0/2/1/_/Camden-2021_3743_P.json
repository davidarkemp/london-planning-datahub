    "Reason : 1 - The proposed alterations to existing telephone kiosks by reason of their change in the structure functionality and use would result in a permanent structure which due to its location, position, detailed design and size would add visual cutter and detract from the character and appearance of the streetscene and Camden Town Conservation Area, contrary to policies D1 (Design) and D2 (Heritage) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed alterations to existing telephone kiosks by reason of their change in the structure functionality and use would result in a permanent structure which due to its location, position, detailed design and size would result in unnecessary street clutter, would reduce the amount of useable, unobstructed footway, which would be detrimental to the quality of the public realm, cause harm to highway and pedestrian safety and hinder pedestrian movement and have a detrimental impact on the promotion of walking as an alternative to motorised transport, contrary to policies G1 (Delivery and location of growth), A1 (Managing the impact of development), C6 (Access for all) and T1 (Prioritising walking, cycling and public transport) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed alterations to existing telephone kiosks by reason of their change in the structure functionality and use would result in a permanent structure which due to its location, position, detailed design and size would add unnecessary street clutter which would increase opportunities for crime in an area which already experiences issues with crime, therefore the proposal would be contrary to policy C5 (Safety and security) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.",
    "Reason : 4 - In absence of a legal agreement to secure the removal of the existing kiosks and a maintenance plan of the proposed kiosk, the proposal would be detrimental to the quality of the public realm, and detract from the character and appearance of the streetscene, contrary to policies D1 (Design), G1 (Delivery and location of growth), A1 (Managing the impact of development), C6 (Access for all) and T1 (Prioritising walking, cycling and public transport) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n"
