    "Condition : 1 - The access ramp hereby granted is limited to a period of no more than 5 years from the date of this decision notice. After such time, the access ramp shall be removed from the site and the retaining wall be reinstated to its original condition.\r\n\r\nReason: The applicant has failed to demonstrate that the proposed development, by virtue of its location, design and access, would not be significantly prejudicial to the delivery of new homes, open space, community facilities or improved pedestrian and cycle links above the existing tracks to the north of Hampstead Road, as part of the required comprehensive development of the area identified as the 'Camden Cutting' in the Euston Area Plan (EAP) 2015. The proposals are therefore contrary to the aims of comprehensive redevelopment within the EAP area and the supporting policies of the Euston Area Plan, and policies H1 Maximising Housing Supply, C2 Community Facilities, A2 Open Space and T1 Prioritising walking, cycling and public transport of the Camden Local Plan 2017, and is therefore permitted on a temporary basis. \r\n",

    "Condition : 3 - All new external work shall be carried out in materials that resemble, as closely as possible, in colour and texture those outlined on the approved plans, unless otherwise specified in the approved application. \r\n\r\nReason: To safeguard the appearance of the premises and the character of the immediate area in accordance with the requirements of Policies D1 and D2 of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017. \r\n\r\n",
    "Condition : 4 - Written Scheme of Investigation (Archaeology)\r\n\r\n(A) The approved works shall accord with the Written Scheme of Investigation (WSI) (reference 158085-ATK-REP-EEN-000001) (revision A01), dated 09/11/2021, hereby approved. \r\n\r\n(B) If heritage assets of archaeological interest are identified by the evaluation under Part A, then before works on the relevant part of the development commence the applicant shall secure the implementation of a \r\nprogramme of archaeological investigation in accordance with a Written Scheme of Investigation which has been submitted by the applicant and approved by the local planning authority in writing.  \r\n \r\nC)  No development or demolition shall take place other that in accordance with the Written Scheme of Investigation approved under Part (B).  \r\n\r\nD) The development shall not be occupied until the site investigation and post investigation assessment has been completed in accordance with the programme set out in the Written Scheme of Investigation approved under Part (B), and the provision for analysis, publication and dissemination of the results and archive deposition has been secured. \r\n\r\nReason: In order to ensure the identification of and minimise damage to important archaeological remains which may exist on this site, in accordance with the requirements of Policy D2 of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017. \r\n\r\n"
