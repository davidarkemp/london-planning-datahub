    "Reason : 2 - In the absence of detailed measures to mitigate the loss of permeable green space, the development fails to be resilient to climate change and would contribute to the risk of surface water flooding, contrary to policies CC2 (Adapting to climate change) and CC3 (Water and flooding) of the Local Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n"
