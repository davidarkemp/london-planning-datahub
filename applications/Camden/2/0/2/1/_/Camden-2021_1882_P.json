    "Condition : 2 - The development hereby permitted shall be carried out in accordance with the following approved plans [insert drawing no.s]\r\n\r\nOR\r\n\r\nThe development hereby permitted shall be carried out in accordance with the approved plans listed in schedule [inset name or number of schedule of plans]\r\n\r\nReason:\r\nFor the avoidance of doubt and in the interest of proper planning.\r\n",
    "Condition : 3 - All new external work shall be carried out in materials that resemble, as closely as possible, in colour and texture those of the existing building, unless otherwise specified in the approved application. \r\n\r\nReason: To safeguard the appearance of the premises and the character of the immediate area in accordance with the requirements of policy D1 [and D2 if in CA] of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017. \r\n",
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed balustrade on the three storey rear wing, by way of its materials and siting, would represent an inappropriate and incongruous feature which would detract from the character and context of the building, the terrace and the townscape in general.  The proposal is therefore contrary to policy D1 (Design) of the LB Camden Local Plan 2017 and policy 2 (Design & Character) of the Fortune Green and West Hampstead Neighbourhood Plan 2015. \r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed terrace, due to its siting, would result in direct overlooking, loss of privacy and disturbance to the bedroom in the roof at 30 Achilles Road.  It would therefore be contrary to policy A (Managing the impacts of development) of the LB Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n "
