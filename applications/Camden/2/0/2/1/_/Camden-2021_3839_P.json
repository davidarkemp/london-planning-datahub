    "Reason : 1 - The proposed roof extension, by reason of its detailed design, bulk, massing, height, materials and undue prominence, would compromise the form, character and appearance of the host building and would thus harm the character and appearance of the streetscene and Belsize Conservation Area, contrary to policies D1 (Design) and D2 (Heritage) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.  \r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - In the absence of detailed drawings of the proposed solar PV panels, it has not been adequately demonstrated that the proposed development would minimise the effects of climate change or meet the highest feasible environmental standards, contrary to policy CC1 (Climate change mitigation) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement to secure a \r\ncontribution to affordable housing, would fail to maximise the contribution of the site to the supply of affordable housing in the borough, contrary to policies H4 (Maximising the supply of affordable housing) and DM1 (Delivery and monitoring) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017. \r\n",
    "Reason : 4 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement securing a  Construction Management Plan, implementation support fee and Construction Impact Bond, would be likely to give rise to conflicts with other road users and be detrimental to the amenity of the area generally, contrary to policies A1 (Managing the impact of development), T4 (Sustainable movement of goods and materials) and DM1 (Delivery and monitoring) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n",
    "Reason : 5 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement to secure the new dwellings as \"car-free\", would be likely to contribute unacceptably to parking stress and congestion in the surrounding area, contrary to policies T2 (Parking and car-free development) and DM1 (Delivery and monitoring) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n"
