    "Reason : 1 - Reason for Refusal:\r\n\r\nThere are two aspects of this proposal that are considered would result in harm to the significance of the listed building as well as the character and appearance of the Regent's Park conservation area.\r\n\r\nThe first is the proposed introduction of railings which appear to hem the building in and separate it from the landscape. \r\n\r\nThe gardens within the Park Villages are an essential part of the overall design, with the informal soft landscape a key to the Picturesque design which was one of John Nash's acknowledged major contributions. The combination of landscape and villas is of major significance and is specifically recognized in the Regent's Park Conservation Area Appraisal and Management Strategy (2011), which on page 20 states:\r\n\r\nThe buildings are unified by the setting, a picturesque landscape which largely survives. The balance of building to landscape is often visible in views between buildings and across intriguing sight lines and is a fundamental element in the special character of the Park Villages.\r\n\r\nThe setting of the buildings within the landscape is a fundamental element in the special character of the Park Villages.\r\n\r\nThe introduction of railings, as proposed here, is deeply harmful to the informal Picturesque landscape itself and to the setting of the Listed Building. It would neither preserve nor enhance the character and appearance of the conservation area.\r\n\r\nConcerns over safety and security are acknowledged but an alternative approach need be considered which is visually less harsh and more in-character with the Picturesque.\r\n\r\nThe other aspect of the proposal that cannot be supported in the boarding-up of fireplaces on the lower ground, ground and second floors. The presence and location of fireplaces is part of the design and layout of the property and of historic architectural significance.\r\n\r\nThe replacement of relatively modern units and fittings is not opposed, and the undertaking of repair and maintenance is p"
