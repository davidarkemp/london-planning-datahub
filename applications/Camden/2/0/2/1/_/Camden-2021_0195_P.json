    "Reason : 1 - The unauthorised residential units by reason of their size, outlook and access to natural light, results in substandard quality of accommodation, contrary to policies H7 of the Camden Local Plan 2017 and Camden Planning Guidance Housing 2021. ",
    "Reason : 2 - The removal of a section of shopfront to create a recessed double balcony, by reason of its siting, design, size, form and scale of the external change its considered to create an incongruous feature which negatively impacts on the host property and the wider streetscene and would therefore be unacceptable and contrary to Policy D1 of the Camden Local Plan 2017. ",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposal development, in the absence of a legal agreement securing car-free housing, would be likely to contribute unacceptably to parking stress and congestion in the surrounding area, contrary to Policies T1, T2 and T3 of the Camden Local Plan, 2017. ",
    "Reason : 4 - The proposed development, without the provision of an affordable housing contribution, would fail to maximise the contribution to the supply of affordable housing in the borough, contrary to policy H4 (Maximising the supply of affordable housing) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017."
