    "Reason : 1 - The proposed first floor extension to the rear closet wing, by reason of its height, location and design, would fail to be a subordinate addition to the host Grade II Listed building, harming its composition and disrupting the pattern of rear development to the wider terrace, to the detriment of the significance of the host building and the character and appearance of the Jeffrey's Street Conservation Area, contrary to policies D1 (Design) and D2 (Heritage) of the Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The applicant has failed to demonstrate that the proposed lowering of the basement level would not cause harm to the structural stability of the building and neighbouring properties and avoid adversely affecting the structural, ground, or water conditions of the area contrary to policy A5 (Basements) of Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement securing an Approval in Principle, would fail to mitigate the impact of the basement works on the adjacent public highway, contrary to policies A1 (Managing the impact of development), T3 (Transport Infrastructure) and DM1 (Delivery and monitoring) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017. \r\n\r\n"
