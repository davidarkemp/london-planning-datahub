    "Reason : 1 - The proposed rear extension, when considered as a cumulative addition to that granted permission as reference 2014/1714/P, would result in an addition to the original building of excessive bulk, scale and footprint that would detract from character of the surrounding area and harm the character and appearance of the conservation area contrary to Policies D1 and D2 of the Camden Local Plan 2017 and Polices DH1 and DH2 of the Hampstead Neighbourhood Plan 2018.\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed rear extension would increase the rear boundary enclosure of 21 Rosslyn Hill to an unacceptable degree and result in loss of outlook and an overbearing physical impact to the neighbouring occupiers contrary to Policy A1 of the Camden Local Plan 2017 and Policy DH1 of the Hampstead Neighbourhood Plan 2018.\r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - The applicant has failed to demonstrate adequately that the construction of the extension within the crown spread, and in such close proximity, to a mature tree that contributes to local amenity in such a manner that will not cause harm to its long term health contrary to Policy NE2 of the Camden Local Plan 2017 and Policy DH1 of the Hampstead Neighbourhood Plan 2018.\r\n"
