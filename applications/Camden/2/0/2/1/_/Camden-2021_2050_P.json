Any trees or areas of planting (including trees existing at the outset of the development other than those indicated to be removed) which, within a period of 5 years from the completion of the development, die, are removed or become seriously damaged or diseased, shall be replaced as soon as is reasonably possible and, in any case, by not later than the end of the following planting season, with others of similar size and species, unless the local planning authority gives written consent to any variation.\n\nReason: To ensure that the landscaping is carried out within a reasonable period and to maintain a high quality of visual amenity in the scheme in accordance with the requirements of policies A2 and A3 of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.\n",

    "Condition : 7 - The outbuilding hereby approved shall only be used for purposes incidental to 20a Agamemnon Road and shall not be used as a self-contained residential or commercial unit. \n \nReason: To ensure that the future occupation of the building does not create inappropriate and substandard accommodation or adversely affect the amenities of the immediate area, in accordance with policies D1, A1 and H6 of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017."
