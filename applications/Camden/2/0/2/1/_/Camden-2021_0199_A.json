    "Reason : 2 - The proposed advertisement, by virtue of its size, siting, prominent location on the building and method of illumination, would in combination with existing digital advertising signage located on the western side of the Euston Underpass, and its proximity to signalled controlled pedestrian crossings, introduce a distraction to traffic and pedestrians, causing harm to highway and public safety, contrary to Transport for London guidance, and Policies A1 (Managing the Impact of Development), D4 (Advertisements) and T1 (Prioritising walking, cycling and public transport) of the Camden Local Plan 2017."
