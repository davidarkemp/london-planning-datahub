    "Reason : 1 - The proposed rear extension and basement below, by reason of size, siting, design and lack of subservience to the host building, would fail to respect the surrounding pattern of development and would cause harm to the character and appearance of the Hampstead Conservation Area, and would also fail to maximise opportunities for greening at the site and would prejudice the ability of the garden to properly support trees and vegetation, contrary to the aims of Policies D1 (Design), D2 (Heritage), A2 (Open space), A3 (Biodiversity) and A5 (Basements) of the Camden Local Plan 2017 and Policies DH1 (Design), DH2 (Conservation areas and listed buildings), NE2 (Trees), NE3 (Biodiversity corridors) and NE4 (Supporting biodiversity) of the Hampstead Neighbourhood Plan 2018. \r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed development, as a result of the basement and associated car lift, would increase the capacity for on-site parking provision and would therefore promote car ownership and thereby fail to promote or encourage trips by sustainable modes of transport, contrary to the aims of Policies T1 (Prioritising walking, cycling and public transport) and T2 (Parking and car-free development) of the Camden Local Plan 2017. \r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement to secure a highways contribution to undertake repair works outside the application site, would fail to restore the pedestrian environment to an acceptable condition, contrary to Policies A1 (Managing the impact of development), T1 (Prioritising walking, cycling and public transport) and T3 (Transport infrastructure) of the Camden Local Plan 2017. \r\n",
