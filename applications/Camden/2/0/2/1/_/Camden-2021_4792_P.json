    "Reason : 3 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement securing a local employment and training package including an appropriate financial contribution, would to lead to the exacerbation of local skill shortages and lack of training and employment opportunities for local residents, contrary to policies G1 (Delivery and location of growth), E1 (Economic development), E2 (Employment premises and sites) and DM1 (Delivery and monitoring) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017. \r\n",
    "Reason : 4 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement securing a Operational Management Plan (including a community working group), would be likely to give rise to harmful impacts with local residents and conflicts with local road users and would be detrimental to the amenity of the area generally contrary to policies A1 (Managing the impact of development), T1 (Prioritising walking, cycling and public transport), (T3 (Transport infrastructure) and DM1 (Delivery and monitoring) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n"
