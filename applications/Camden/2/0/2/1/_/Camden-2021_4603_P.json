    "Reason : 1 - The proposed extension, by virtue of its siting, scale, form, bulk, detailed design and materials, would result in an incongruous and unsympathetic addition, which would disrupt the architectural symmetry and balanced composition of the rear elevations of the host and neighbouring buildings (nos. 11 and 13 King Henry's Road) when viewed together as a pair. The proposal would therefore be harmful to the character and appearance of the host building and wider rear terrace, contrary to Policy D1 (Design) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed extension, by virtue of its siting, scale, form and bulk, would result in harm to neighbouring amenity (no.13 King Henry's Road) in terms of increased sense of enclosure, diminished outlook and loss of daylight, contrary to Policy A1 (Managing the impact of development) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017."
