Approved mitigation details as set out in the Environmental Noise Report for Planning rev P03 prepared by Cundall dated 01/02/2022 shall be implemented prior to commissioning of the installation and thereafter be permanently retained.\r\n\r\nReason: To ensure that the amenity of occupiers of the development site/ surrounding premises is not adversely affected by noise from mechanical equipment in accordance with the requirements of policies A1 and A4 of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017\r\n\r\n"
