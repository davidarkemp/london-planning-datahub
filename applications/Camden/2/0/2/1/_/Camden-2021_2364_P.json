    "Condition : 2 - All new external work shall be carried out in materials that resemble, as closely as possible, in colour and texture those of the existing building, unless otherwise specified in the approved application. \r\n\r\nReason: To safeguard the appearance of the premises and the character of the immediate area in accordance with the requirements of policy D1 and D2 of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n",
    "Condition : 3 - The development hereby permitted shall be carried out in accordance with the following approved plans PL 0020 Rev P2, PL 0504 Rev P3, PL 0010 Rev P2 and PL 0505 Rev P1.\r\n\r\nReason: For the avoidance of doubt and in the interest of proper planning.\r\n",
    "Condition : 4 - Prior to commencement of any works the short term measures spelt out in the Survey Report should be carried out as a matter of some urgency. Ranking shores can be erected along the length of the wall to prevent collapse and the soil banked up against the wall dug away with a 45 degrees batter.\r\n\r\nReason: For the purposes of health and safety\r\n",
    "Condition : 5 - The wall should be dismantled by hand and the bricks salvaged and stored for reuse on site. Once the required foundations have been prepared the wall should be reconstructed with the salvaged bricks using the same brick bond, lime mortar, joint widths and any detailing (e.g. shoulders, panels, string courses or caping) as per the original wall. Any details, coping etc should be replicated. Any shortage of bricks should be made up with bricks to match the existing and located randomly throughout the wall rather than used to construct any single section.\r\n\r\nReason: To safeguard the appearance of the premises and the character of the immediate area in accordance with the requirements of policy D1 and D2 of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.
