    "Reason : 1 - The use as an escape room does not fall within the description of Class N, this is meant for uses where people play on electronic gaming machines or amusement machines / arcade games. It is therefore not development permitted by Class N and the application is refused under paragraph W(3) of Part 3 of Schedule 2 to the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development Order) 2015 (as amended).",
    "Reason : 2 - Even if the use were within the description of Class N, that use as an escape room does not appear to be lawful. Under Article 3(5)(b) a permission granted in connection with an existing use does not apply if that use is unlawful. It appears the use commenced at some point around 2012 -2014 and has since ceased. There was no continuous use for a period of 10 years so it did not accrue lawfulness. It is therefore not development permitted by Class N and the application is refused under paragraph W(3) of Part 3 of Schedule 2 to the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development Order) 2015 (as amended).",
    "Reason : 3 - Transport and highways impact: Even if the use were within the description of Class N, and that use were lawful,  in the absence of a Section 106 legal agreement to secure the residential units as car-free, the development would contribute unacceptably to parking stress and traffic congestion in the surrounding area and would not promote the use of sustainable transport, and is contrary to the NPPF and policies A1 (Managing the Impact of development), T1 (Prioritising walking, cycling and public transport), T2 (Parking and car-free development) of London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017, National Planning Policy Framework 2019 and London Plan 2021."
