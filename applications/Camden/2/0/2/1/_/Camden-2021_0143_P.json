    "Reason : 1 - The proposed cumulative extensions to the existing dwelling by reason of their detailed design, height, size, bulk and siting would subsume the host property, harming its character and appearance, the streetscene and Hampstead conservation area, contrary to policies D1 (design) and D2 (heritage) of the Camden Local Plan 2017 and policies DH1 (design) and DH2 (Conservation areas and listed buildings) of the Hampstead Neighbourhood Plan (2018). \r\n",

    "Reason : 3 - The basement, by reason of its disproportionately large size and the absence of an adequate Basement Impact Assessment, would likely cause harm to neighbouring properties and the amenity of neighbouring residents, contrary to policies A1 (Managing the impact of development) and A5 (Basements) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017 and Policy BA1 (Basement Impact Assessments) of the Hampstead Neighbourhood Plan (2018).\r\n",
    "Reason : 4 - In absence of a comprehensive and adequate daylight and sunlight impact report to demonstrate otherwise, it is considered likely that the new dwelling would result in a harmful loss of daylight to residential properties at no.'s 12 and 14 Eldon Grove, contrary to policy A1 (Managing the impact of development) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n",
    "Reason : 5 - The proposed new dwelling, by reason of its siting and scale, would result in a loss of outlook to residential properties at no.'s 12 and 14 Eldon Grove contrary to policy A1 (Managing the impact of development) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.  ",
    "Reason : 6 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement securing a Construction Management Plan and associated monitoring fee, would be likely to contribute unacceptably to traffic disruption and be detrimental to general highway and pedestrian safety, contrary to policies A1 (Managing the impact of development) and T4 (Sustainable movement of goods and materials) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017 Policy BA3 (Construction Management Plans) of the Hampstead Neighbourhood Plan (2018).\r\n",

    "Reason : 8 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement securing financial contributions towards highways works, would fail to secure adequate provision for and safety of pedestrians, cyclists and vehicles, contrary to policies T3 (Transport infrastructure) and A1 (Managing the impact of development) of London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017 and Policy TT2 (Pedestrian environments) of the Hampstead Neighbourhood Plan (2018).\r\n",
    "Reason : 9 - In the absence of a legal agreement for car-free housing, the proposed development would be likely to contribute unacceptably to parking stress and congestion in the surrounding area and fail to promote more sustainable and efficient forms of transport, contrary to policies T1 (Prioritising walking, cycling and public transport), T2 (Parking and Car Parking) and A1 (Managing the impact of development) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017 and Policy TT4 (Cycle and car ownership) of the Hampstead Neighbourhood Plan (2018).\r\n",
    "Reason : 10 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement securing a \r\ncontribution to affordable housing, would fail to ensure the provision of the required amount of affordable housing for the scheme, contrary to policy H4 (Maximising the supply of affordable Housing) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n "
