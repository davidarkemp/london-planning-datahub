    "Condition : 1 - The development hereby permitted must be begun not later than the end of three years from the date of this permission.\r\n\r\nReason: In order to comply with the provisions of Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended).\r\n\r\n",
    "Condition : 2 - The development hereby permitted shall be carried out in accordance with the following approved plans:\r\n01; 02; 03; 04; 05; 06 Rev. A; 07 Rev. A; 08 Rev. A; Basement Impact Assessment Rev. 2 produced by Croft Structural Engineers dated July 2020; Design and Access Statement dated Dec 2019; Hydrogeology, Land Stability and Ground Movement Assessment produced by Maund Geo-Consulting dated July 2020\r\n\r\nReason:\r\nFor the avoidance of doubt and in the interest of proper planning.\r\n",
    "Condition : 3 - All new external work shall be carried out in materials that resemble, as closely as possible, in colour and texture those of the existing building, unless otherwise specified in the approved application. \r\n\r\nReason: To safeguard the appearance of the premises and the character of the immediate area in accordance with the requirements of policies D1 and D2 of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017 and policies 2 and 3 of the Fortune Green and West Hampstead Neighbourhood Plan 2015. ",
    "Condition : 4 - The landscaping to the front boundary and garden as shown on drawing numbers 06 Rev. B and 07 Rev. B must be provided prior to the commencement of use of the basement space, and be retained as such hereafter. \r\n\r\nReason: To safeguard the appearance of the premises and the character of the immediate area in accordance with the requirements of policies D1 and D2 of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017 and policies 2 and 3 of the Fortune Green and West Hampstead Neighbourhood Plan 2015. ",
    "Condition : 5 - The floorspace at basement level hereby approved shall only be used in connection with, and ancillary to, the ground floor flat as a residential dwelling. The basement accommodation shall not be occupied as a self-contained flat. \r\n \r\nReason: The use of the basement level as a self-contained flat, separate from the use of the remainder of the application property as an independent dwelling, would raise materially different planning considerations that the Council would wish to consider at that time, in accordance with Policies CC2, CC3, A1 and H3 of the Local Plan 2017. ",
    "Condition : 6 - The development hereby approved shall be carried out strictly in accordance with the methodologies, flood mitigation measures and recommendations of the Basement Impact Assessment Ref: 190906 Rev 2 dated 21.07.20, Hydrogeology, land stability and ground movement assessment ref: MGC-BIA-19-29-V3 and other supporting documents hereby approved. \r\n \r\nReason: To safeguard the appearance and structural stability of neighbouring buildings and to reduce the rate of surface water run-off from the buildings and limit the impact on the storm-water drainage system in accordance with policies CC2, CC3 and A5 of the Camden Local Plan 2017. ",
    "Condition : 7 - The development hereby approved shall not commence until such time as a suitably qualified chartered engineer with membership of the appropriate professional body has been appointed to inspect, approve and monitor the critical elements of both permanent and temporary basement construction works throughout their duration to ensure compliance with the design which has been checked and approved by a building control body. Details of the appointment and the appointee's responsibilities shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority prior to the commencement of development. Any subsequent change or reappointment shall be confirmed forthwith for the duration of the construction works.  \r\n \r\nReason:  To safeguard the appearance and structural stability of neighbouring buildings and the character of the immediate area in accordance with the requirements of  policies D1, D2 and A5 of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017."
