    "Reason : 1 - The proposed roof extension by virtue of its scale, siting, form and design would be an inappropriate and incongruous addition to the building which would harm the appearance of the host building, detract from the roofscape on this side of Swain's Lane and cause harm to the character and appearance of the Holly Lodge Estate Conservation Area. It would therefore be contrary to policies D1 (Design) and D2 (Heritage) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017 and Policy DH2 and DH5 of the Highgate Neighbourhood Plan 2017.  It would also be contrary to the London Plan 2021 and the NPPF 2021.  "
