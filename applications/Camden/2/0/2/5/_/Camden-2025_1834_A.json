    "Condition : 1 - No advertisement is to be displayed without the permission of the owner of the site or any other person with an interest in the site entitled to grant permission.\r\n\r\nReason: - As required by regulation 2(1) and Schedule 2 of the Town & Country Planning (Control of Advertisements) (England) Regulations 2007.\r\n",
    "Condition : 2 - No advertisement shall be sited or displayed so as to\r\n(a) endanger persons using any highway, railway, waterway, dock, harbour or aerodrome (civil or military);\r\n(b) obscure, or hinder the ready interpretation of any traffic sign, railway signal or aid to navigation by water or air; or\r\n(c) hinder the operation of any device used for the purpose of security or surveillance or for measuring the speed of any vehicle\r\n\r\nReason: - As required by regulation 2(1) and Schedule 2 of the Town & Country Planning (Control of Advertisements) (England) Regulations 2007.\r\n",
    "Condition : 3 - Any advertisement displayed and any site used for the display of advertisements, shall be maintained in a condition that does not impair the visual amenity of the site.\r\n\r\nReason: - As required by regulation 2(1) and Schedule 2 of the Town & Country Planning (Control of Advertisements) (England) Regulations 2007.\r\n",
    "Condition : 4 - Any structure or hoarding erected or used principally for the purpose of displaying advertisements shall be maintained in a safe condition.\r\n\r\nReason: - As required by regulation 2(1) and Schedule 2 of the Town & Country Planning (Control of Advertisements) (England) Regulations 2007.\r\n",
    "Condition : 5 - Where an advertisement is required under these Regulations to be removed, the site shall be left in a condition that does not endanger the public or impair visual amenity.\r\n\r\nReason: - As required by regulation 2(1) and Schedule 2 of the Town & Country Planning (Control of Advertisements) (England) Regulations 2007.\r\n",
    "Condition : 6 - The intensity of the illumination of the LED digital screen shall not exceed 2500 candelas per square metre during the day, in line with the maximum permitted recommended luminance as set out by 'The Institute of Lighting Professional's 'Professional Lighting Guide 05: The Brightness of Illuminated Advertisements Including Digital Displays (published 2023). The levels of luminance on the digital sign should be controlled by light sensors to measure the ambient brightness and dimmers to control the lighting output to within these limits, and will only be in operation between the hours of 08:00 and 20:00 for the temporary period.\r\n\r\nReason: To ensure that the advertisement does not harm the character and appearance of the area and does not create a distraction to pedestrian or vehicular traffic and therefore cause a hazard to highway safety. In accordance with the requirements of policies D4, A1 and T1 of the Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n",
    "Condition : 7 - The free-standing structure with integral LED screen hereby permitted is for a temporary period only and shall be removed and the site made good on or before 26/09/2025.  \r\n\r\nReason: The type of structure is not such as the Council is prepared to approve, other than for a limited period, in view of its appearance. The permanent retention of the structure would be contrary to the requirements of policies A1 and D1 of the Camden Local Plan 2017."
