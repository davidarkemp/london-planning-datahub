  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed telephone kiosk, by reason of its location, size and detailed design, would add harmful visual clutter and detract from the character and appearance of the street scene, Fitzrovia East Neighbourhood and Bloomsbury Conservation Area, and the setting of the adjacent Grade II* Listed Building, contrary to Policies D1 (Design) and D2 (Heritage) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017 and Part 3 (Vision and objectives) of the Fitzrovia Area Action Plan 2014.",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed telephone kiosk, by virtue of its location, size and detailed design, adding to unnecessary street clutter, would reduce the amount of useable, unobstructed footway, which would be detrimental to the quality of the public realm, cause harm to highway safety and hinder pedestrian movement and have a detrimental impact on the promotion of walking as an alternative to motorised transport, contrary to Policies G1 (Delivery and location of growth), A1 (Managing the impact of development), C6 (Access for all), D8 (Public Realm) and T1 (Prioritising walking, cycling and public transport) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed telephone kiosk, by reason of its inappropriate siting, size and design would fail to reduce opportunities for crime and antisocial behaviour in an area to the detriment of community safety and security, and compromise the safety of those using and servicing the telephone kiosk, contrary to Policy C5 (Safety and security) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.",
    "Reason : 4 - In absence of a legal agreement to secure a maintenance plan for the proposed telephone kiosk, the proposal would be detrimental to the quality of the public realm, and detract from the character and appearance of the streetscene, contrary to Policies D1 (Design), G1 (Delivery and location of growth), A1 (Managing the impact of development), C6 (Access for all) and T1 (Prioritising walking, cycling and public transport) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017."
