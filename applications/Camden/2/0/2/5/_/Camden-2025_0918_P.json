    "Reason : 1 - The proposal by reason of its location, size and detailed design, would add harmful visual clutter, detrimentally impacting on the character and appearance of the public realm and wider street scene, contrary to policy D1 (Design) of the Camden Local Plan 2017..",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed Street Hub, by virtue of its location, size, and detailed design, would add unnecessary street clutter and reduce the amount of useable and unobstructed footway. The proposals therefore, fails to make improvements to the pedestrian environment to the detriment of the public realm, causing harm to highway safety, hindering pedestrian movement and impacting on the promotion of walking as an alternative to motorised transport, contrary to policies G1 (Delivery and location of growth), A1 (Managing the impact of development), C6 (Access for all), T1 (Prioritising walking, cycling and public transport) and T2 (Healthy Streets) of the Camden Local Plan 2017.",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed Street Hub, by virtue of its inappropriate siting, size and design, would fail to reduce opportunities for crime and antisocial behaviour to the detriment of community safety and security, and compromise the safety of those using and servicing the hub, contrary to policy C5 (Safety and Security) and T2 (Healthy Streets) of the Camden Local Plan 2017",
    "Reason : 4 - In the absence of a legal agreement to secure a maintenance plan for the proposed Street Hub, the proposal would be detrimental to the quality of the public realm, and detract from the character and appearance of the streetscene, contrary to policies D1 (Design), G1 (Delivery and location of growth), A1 (Managing the impact of development), C6 (Access for all) and T1 (Prioritising walking, cycling and public transport) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017, and policies 2 (Design & character)."
