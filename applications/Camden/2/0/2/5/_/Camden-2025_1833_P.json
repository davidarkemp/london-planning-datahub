    "Condition : 1 - The free-standing structure with integral LED screen hereby permitted is for a temporary period only and shall be removed and the site made good on or before 26/09/2025.  \r\n\r\nReason: The type of structure is not such as the Council is prepared to approve, other than for a limited period, in view of its appearance. The permanent retention of the structure would be contrary to the requirements of policies A1 and D1 of the Camden Local Plan 2017. \r\n",
    "Condition : 2 - The development hereby permitted shall be carried out in accordance with the following approved plans: CSG-PLANNING-01 (site location plan); FP-SW-SC-L00-01000 rev 02 (proposed site layout plan); Detailed screen dimensions document (combined images) received 29/04/2025; Photo sheet (5 x photographs) received 29/04/2025; Cover Letter from CBRE (Central Saint Giles) dated 31/03/2025; Operational Management Plan (Summer 2025) from CBRE (Central Saint Giles) received 29/04/2025; Screen Location and Positioning document from CBRE (Central Saint Giles) dated 31/03/2025; Noise Impact Assessment from F1 Acoustics Company Limited (ref. 1861/TechnicalMemoNoise/Rev0) dated 13/07/2023; Noise Impact Assessment from F1 Acoustics Company Limited (ref. 1944/TechnicalMemoNoise/Rev0) dated 22/03/2024 (with Addendum 2025 from Cavendish Technical Engineers).\r\n\r\nReason: For the avoidance of doubt and in the interest of proper planning.\r\n",
    "Condition : 3 - All new external work shall be carried out in materials that resemble, as closely as possible, in colour and texture those of the existing building, unless otherwise specified in the approved application. \r\n\r\nReason: To safeguard the appearance of the premises and the character of the immediate area in accordance with the requirements of policy D1 of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017. \r\n",
    "Condition : 4 - The external noise level emitted from proposed LED screen at the development shall not exceed LAeq,15min 67dB at 5m from the screen operating at maximum capacity and thereafter be permanently retained for the consented time period.\r\n\r\nReason: To ensure that the amenity of occupiers of the development site / surrounding premises are not adversely affected by noise from the installed screen and associated equipment in accordance with the requirements of policies A1 and A4 of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n",
    "Condition : 5 - The intensity of the illumination of the LED digital screen shall not exceed 2500 candelas per square metre during the day, in line with the maximum permitted recommended luminance as set out by 'The Institute of Lighting Professional's 'Professional Lighting Guide 05: The Brightness of Illuminated Advertisements Including Digital Displays (published 2023). The levels of luminance on the digital sign should be controlled by light sensors to measure the ambient brightness and dimmers to control the lighting output to within these limits, and will only be in operation between the hours of 08:00 and 20:00 for the temporary period.\r\n\r\nReason: To ensure that the advertisement does not harm the character and appearance of the area and does not create a distraction to pedestrian or vehicular traffic and therefore cause a hazard to highway safety. In accordance with the requirements of policies D4, A1 and T1 of the Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n",
    "Condition : 6 - The hours of operation of the LED screen hereby permitted shall be restricted to between the hours of 08:00 and 20:00 for the temporary period and any sound emitted from the screen limited to between the hours of 12:00 and 20:00.\r\n\r\nReason: The type of operation is not such as the Council is prepared to approve, other than for a limited period, in view of its impact. Longer operation of the sound would be contrary to the requirements of policies A1 and A4 of the Camden Local Plan 2017."
