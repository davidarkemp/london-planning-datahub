  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed single storey dwellinghouse by reason of its inappropriate bulk, scale, location, massing, and detailed design would cause harm to the architectural composition of the host building and the character and appearance of the West End Green Conservation Area contrary to policies D1 (Design) and D2 (Heritage) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed single storey dwellinghouse by reason of its inappropriate height, design, extent, and proximity to the host building, would result in a loss of privacy to the occupiers within the flats of the host building, whilst also resulting in poor amenity outcomes to future occupiers. In the absence of a Daylight/Sunlight Assessment, insufficient evidence has been provided to demonstrate that the proposal would not result in a loss of daylight to the rear facing windows of the lower ground / ground floor flats of the host building. The proposal is therefore contrary to policy A1 (Managing the impacts of development) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017, the London Plan 2021 and the NPPF 2023.\r\n ",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed single storey dwellinghouse by reason of its footprint would result in the loss of an excessive part of garden space which contributes to the character of the townscape, the loss communal amenity space for occupiers of the host building, whilst also exceeding the scale of what could be considered a subordinate garden building. The proposal is therefore contrary to policy D1 (Design) and A3 (Biodiversity) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017 and policy 17 of the Fortune Green and West Hampstead Neighbourhood Plan.\r\n",
    "Reason : 4 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement securing car-free housing, would contribute unacceptably to parking stress and congestion in the surrounding area and fail to promote more sustainable and efficient forms of transport and active lifestyles, contrary to policies T2 (Parking and car-free development) and DM1 (Delivery and monitoring) of the Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n"
