  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development, through insufficient evidence to justify the demolition of the existing building, would result in an unsustainable development that fails to contribute to a low carbon future through efficient use of resources, contrary to policy CC1 (Climate change mitigation) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017 and policy SI 7 (Reducing waste and supporting the circular economy) of the London Plan 2021.",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed development, by reason of its scale, roof form, detailed design, and fenestration pattern, would result in an incongruous and overly dominant building that fails to integrate with the existing streetscene and pattern of development, thus failing to preserve or enhance the character and appearance of the application site, neighbouring buildings, and the wider Fitzjohns Netherhall conservation area, contrary to policies D1 (Design) and D2 (Heritage) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement securing the development as 'car-capped' housing to prevent residents other than the named returning resident from obtaining residents parking permits, would contribute unacceptably to parking stress and congestion in the surrounding area and fail to promote more sustainable and efficient forms of transport and active lifestyles, contrary to policies T2 (Parking and car-free development) and DM1 (Delivery and monitoring) of the London borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.",
    "Reason : 4 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement securing a Construction Management Plan (CMP), associated contributions to support the implementation of the CMP, and an impact bond, would be likely to give rise to conflicts with other road users and be detrimental to the amenities of the area generally, contrary to policies A1 (Managing the impact of development), T4 (Sustainable movement of goods and materials), and DM1 (Delivery and monitoring) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.",
    "Reason : 5 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement securing financial contributions towards highways works, would fail to secure adequate provision for the safety of pedestrians, cyclists, and vehicles, contrary to policies T3 (Transport infrastructure) and A1 (Managing the impact of development) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017."
