    "Reason : 1 - The proposed Pulse Smart Hub, by reason of its location, size and detailed design, would add harmful visual clutter and detract from the character and appearance of the street scene and the adjacent Regent's Canal Conservation Area, and harm the setting of the adjacent Grade II and II* listed buildings, contrary to policies D1 (Design) and D2 (Heritage) of the Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed Pulse Smart Hub, by virtue of its location, size and detailed design, and adding unnecessary street clutter, would reduce the amount of useable, unobstructed footway, which would be detrimental to the quality of the public realm, cause harm to highway safety and hinder pedestrian movement and have a detrimental impact on the promotion of walking as an alternative to motorised transport, contrary to policies G1 (Delivery and location of growth), A1 (Managing the impact of development), C6 (Access for all) and T1 (Prioritising walking, cycling and public transport) of the Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed Pulse Smart Hub, by virtue of its inappropriate siting, size and design, would fail to reduce opportunities for crime and antisocial behaviour to the detriment of community safety and security, and compromise the safety of those using and servicing the telephone kiosk, contrary to policy C5 (Safety and Security) of the Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n",
    "Reason : 4 - In the absence of a legal agreement to secure a maintenance plan for the proposed Pulse Smart Hub, the proposal would be detrimental to the quality of the public realm, and detract from the character and appearance of the streetscene, contrary to policies D1 (Design), G1 (Delivery and location of growth), A1 (Managing the impact of development), C6 (Access for all) and T1 (Prioritising walking, cycling and public transport) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017."
