    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development, in the absence of any evidence to show that the property has been marketed for a suitable length of time, fails to demonstrate that the existing business use is no longer viable and capable of providing employment benefits to local residents and businesses contrary to policies E1 and E2 of the Camden Local Plan 2017 and policies E1 and E2 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed development, which includes the provision of a hotel outside the Central London Area or a Town Centre, would fail to make the best use of its site and risks harm to local character contrary to policies G1 (Delivery and location of growth) and E3 (Tourism) of the Camden Local Plan 2017 and policy E10 (visitor infrastructure) of the London Plan 2021.\r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed development, in the absence of a Hotel Management Plan, risks harm to residential amenity, the local transport network and public safety contrary to policies C5 (Safety and security), E3 (Tourism), T2 (Parking and car-free development) and T4 of the Camden Local Plan 2017 and policies E10 (visitor infrastructure), T4 (Assessing and mitigating transport impacts), T6.4 (Hotel and leisure uses parking), D11 (Safety, security and resilience to emergency) and D14 (Noise) of the London Plan 2021.",
    "Reason : 4 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement to secure a financial contribution towards pedestrian, cyclist and environmental improvements in the area, would fail to mitigate the impact of the development created by increased trips, contrary to policies T1 (Prioritising walking, cycling and public transport), A1 (Managing the impact of development) and DM1 (Delivery and monitoring) of the Camden Local Plan 2017 and policy T4 (Assessing and mitigating transport impacts) of the London Plan 2021.",
    "Reason : 5 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement to secure a financial contribution towards micro and shared mobility improvements, would fail to promote active and sustainable travel options contrary to policies T1 (Prioritising walking, cycling and public transport) and T3 (Transport infrastructure) of the Camden Local Plan 2017 and policy T4 (Assessing and mitigating transport impacts) of the London Plan 2021.",
    "Reason : 6 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement to secure a financial contribution for a disabled parking space within 50m of the development, would fail to promote fair access and opportunity for all contrary to policy C6 (Access for all) of the Camden Local Plan 2017 and policy T6 (Car parking) and T6.4 (Hotel and leisure uses parking) of the London Plan 2021.",
    "Reason : 7 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement to secure the details set out in the sustainability and energy plans and BREEAM pre-assessment, would be likely to contribute unacceptably to climate change, contrary to policies CC1 (Climate change mitigation) and CC2 (Adapting to climate change) of the Camden Local Plan 2017 and policies SI2 (Minimising greenhouse gas emissions) and SI3 (Energy infrastructure) of the London Plan 2021.\r\n",
    "Reason : 8 - The proposal, in the absence of a legal agreement to secure a car-free development, would be likely to contribute unacceptably to parking stress, environmental impacts and congestion in the surrounding area, contrary to policies T1 (Prioritising walking, cycling and public transport), T2 (Parking and car-free development) and CC1 (Climate change mitigation) of the Camden Local Plan 2017."
