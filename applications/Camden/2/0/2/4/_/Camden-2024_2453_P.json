    "Condition : 2 - The development hereby permitted shall be carried out in accordance with the following approved plans:-\r\nSite Location Plan, Existing Block Plan Rev 2, Proposed Block Plan Rev 2, (1167) A01 Rev 1, A02 Rev 2\r\n\r\nReason: For the avoidance of doubt and in the interest of proper planning.\r\n",
    "Condition : 3 - All new external work shall be carried out in materials that resemble, as closely as possible, in colour and texture those of the existing building, unless otherwise specified in the approved application. \r\n\r\nReason: To safeguard the appearance of the premises and the character of the immediate area in accordance with the requirements of policy D1 of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017 and policy 2 of the Fortune Green and West Hampstead Neighbourhood Plan 2015.\r\n",
    "Condition : 4 - During construction/demolition works, if evidence of potential contamination is encountered, works shall cease and the site fully assessed to enable an appropriate remediation plan to be developed. Works shall not recommence until an appropriate remediation scheme has been submitted to, and approved in writing by, the local planning authority and the remediation has been completed. Upon completion of the building works, this condition shall not be discharged until a closure report has been submitted to, and improved in writing by, the local planning authority.\r\n\r\nReason: To ensure the risks from land contamination to the future users of the land and neighbouring land are minimised, together with those to controlled waters, property and ecological systems, and to ensure that the development can be carried out safely without unacceptable risks to workers, neighbours and other offsite receptors, in accordance with policies G1, D1, A1, and DM1 of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n"
