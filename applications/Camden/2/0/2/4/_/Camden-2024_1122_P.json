    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development by reason of its failure to optimise the capacity of the site, would inhibit the development potential of the site and make inefficient use of Camden's limited land. The proposal is therefore contrary to policies D1 (Design) and G1 (Delivery and location of growth) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017 and SD2, SD4, and SD5 of the Redington Frognal Neighbourhood Plan 2021 and policy D3 of the London Plan 2021",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed design by reason of design, form and fenestration pattern, would be detrimental to the character and appearance of the area. The design and form would result in an incoherent and unordered building, failing to contribute positively to the area.  The proposal is therefore contrary to policies D1 (Design) and G1 (Delivery and location of growth) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017 and SD2, SD4 and SD5 of the Redington Frognal Neighbourhood Plan 2021.",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed development, by reason of larger homes with poor quality design, would result in units with poor internal layouts and outlook in living areas to the detriment of future occupiers, contrary to policies D1 (Design) and H6 (Housing choice) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017",
    "Reason : 4 - The proposed terraces and massing of the buildings would result in unacceptable impact on residential amenity of neighbouring properties by way of overlooking, loss of privacy, and impact on light. It would therefore be contrary to policy A1 (Managing the impacts of development) and D1 (design) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.",
    "Reason : 5 - The proposed basement extension, in the absence of an appropriate Basement Impact Assessment to demonstrate otherwise, would be likely to cause harm to the stability of neighbouring properties and the local hydrogeological environment, contrary to policy A5 (Basements) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.",
    "Reason : 6 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement securing an Approval in Principle Plan and associated monitoring fee, would be likely to be detrimental to highway infrastructure and general highway and pedestrian safety, contrary to policies T3 (Transport infrastructure) and A1 (Managing the impact of development) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017",
    "Reason : 7 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement securing financial contributions towards highways works, would fail to secure adequate provision for and safety of pedestrians, cyclists and vehicles, contrary to policies T3 (Transport infrastructure) and A1 (Managing the impact of development) of London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.",
    "Reason : 8 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement securing an affordable housing contribution, would fail to maximise the supply of affordable to meet the needs of households unable to access market housing, contrary to policy H4 (Maximising the supply of affordable housing) of the Camden Local Plan 2017.",
    "Reason : 9 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement securing a Construction Management Plan (CMP), associated contributions to support the implementation of the CMP, and an impact bond, would be likely to give rise to conflicts with other road users and be detrimental to the amenities of the area generally, contrary to policies A1 (Managing the impact of development), T4 (Sustainable movement of goods and materials) and DM1 (Delivery and monitoring) of the Camden Local Plan 2017.",
    "Reason : 10 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement securing car-free housing, would contribute unacceptably to parking stress and congestion in the surrounding area and fail to promote more sustainable and efficient forms of transport and active lifestyles, contrary to policies T2 (Parking and car-free development) and DM1 (Delivery and monitoring) of the Camden Local Plan 2017."
