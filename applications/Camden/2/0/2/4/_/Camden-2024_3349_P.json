    "Reason : 1 - The proposed demolition of the existing closet wing, by reason of the loss of historic fabric and associated evidential value, would be harmful to the special architectural and historic interest of the Grade I listed host building and its setting, the setting of its curtilage building and the setting of adjacent Grade I listed buildings.  As such the proposal would be harmful to the character and appearance of the Conservation Area contrary to policies D1 (Design) and D2 (Heritage) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed rear extension, by reason of its height, bulk, mass, form, modelling and detailed design would be harmful to the special architectural and historic interest of the Grade I listed host building and its setting, the setting of its curtilage building and the setting of adjacent Grade I listed buildings.  As such the proposal would be harmful to the character and appearance of the Conservation Area contrary to policies D1 (Design) and D2 (Heritage) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed alterations to the mews building, by reason of their detailed design, would be harmful to the special architectural and historic interest of the Grade I listed host building and its setting, the setting of its curtilage building and the setting of adjacent Grade I listed buildings.  As such the proposal would be harmful to the character and appearance of the Conservation Area contrary to policies D1 (Design) and D2 (Heritage) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n",
    "Reason : 4 - The proposed alteration of the upper staircase flight, the proposed roof light, the replacement chimney pieces and the alterations to the basement planform, by reason of the loss of evidential value, and the introduction of less appropriate designs, would be would be harmful to the special architectural and historic interest of the Grade I listed host building. As such the proposal would be harmful to the character and appearance of the Conservation Area contrary to policies D1 (Design) and D2 (Heritage) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n",
    "Reason : 5 - In the absence of adequate dynamic thermal modelling to demonstrate the need for active cooling equipment, the Council cannot be satisfied that the proposed works are justified and that appropriate climate adaptation measures to reduce the impact of urban and dwelling overheating could not be achieved by other preferred measures as set out in the cooling hierarchy. The proposal is therefore contrary to policy CC2 (Adapting to climate change) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n\r\n"
