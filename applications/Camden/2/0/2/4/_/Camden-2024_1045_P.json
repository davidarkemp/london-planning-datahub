    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development, through insufficient evidence to justify the substantial demolition of the existing building, would result in an unsustainable development that fails to contribute to a low carbon future through efficient use of resources, contrary to policy CC1 (climate change mitigation) of the Camden Local Plan 2017 and policy SI7 of the London Plan 2021. ",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed development, by reason of its scale, height, bulk, form, massing, footprint, design, fenestration pattern and materiality, would result in an incoherent and incongruous form of development which causes harm to character and appearance of the host property, street scene and wider conservation  area, contrary to policies D1 (Design) and D2 (Heritage) of the Camden Local Plan (2017) and policies SD2 (Redington Frognal Conservation Area), SD4 (Redington Frognal Character), SD5 (Dwellings: Extensions and garden development) and SD6 (Retention of architectural details in existing buildings) of the Redington Frognal Neighbourhood Plan 2021. ",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed basement, by reason of its excessive scale and sitting, would fail to achieve subordinance to the host property, and in the absence of sufficient information to demonstrate otherwise, the Council cannot be satisfied that the proposed basements would not cause harm to the structural stability of neighbouring properties or avoid cumulative impacts on ground and structural stability or the water environment of the local area, contrary to policy A5 (Basements) of the Camen Local Plan 2017 and policy UD1 (Underground development) of the Redington Frognal Neighbourhood Plan 2021.",
    "Reason : 4 - The proposed development, by reason of excessive on-site parking provision, would fail to promote more sustainable and efficient forms of transport and active lifestyles, contrary to policies CC1 (Climate change mitigation), CC4 (Air Quality), T1 (Prioritising walking, cycling and public transport) and T2 (Parking and car-free development) of the Camen Local Plan 2017.",
    "Reason : 5 - The proposed development, by reason of the excessive south facing glazing on the roof extension, and in the absence of sufficient evidence to demonstrate otherwise, would likely result in overheating of the top floor habitable rooms, causing harm to the health and safety of future occupants and creating demand for active cooling leading to excessive energy use, contrary to policy CC1 (Climate change mitigation) and CC2 (Adapting to climate change) of the Camden Local Plan 2017 and policies D6 (Housing quality standards) and SI4 (Managing heat risk) of the London Plan 2021.\r\n",
    "Reason : 6 - In the absence of a legal agreement securing a Construction Management Plan, construction impact bond and an implementation and monitoring fee, the development would be likely to give rise to conflicts with other road users and be detrimental to the amenities of the area generally, contrary to policies G1 (Delivery and location of growth), A1 (Managing the impact of development), A4 (Noise and vibration), CC4 (Air quality), T3 (Transport infrastructure), T4 (Sustainable movement of goods and materials), and DM1 (Delivery and monitoring) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.",
    "Reason : 7 - In the absence of a legal agreement securing financial contributions towards repaving of the existing vehicle crossovers and an Approval in Principle, the proposal would fail to mitigate the impacts of the development on the public highway, contrary to policies A1 (Managing the impact of development), T3 (Transport infrastructure), and DM1 (Delivery and monitoring) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017."
