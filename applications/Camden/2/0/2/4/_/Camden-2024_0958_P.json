    "Condition : 1 - The development hereby permitted must be begun not later than the end of three years from the date of this permission.\r\n\r\nReason: In order to comply with the provisions of Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended).\r\n\r\n",
    "Condition : 2 - The development hereby permitted shall be carried out in accordance with the following approved plans: \r\n\r\n225 (00) 001, 225 (00) 002, 225 (00) 100 Lower Ground, 225 (00) 100 Ground Floor, 225 (00) 100 Roof Plan,  225 (00) 201, 225 (01) 100,  225 (00) 100 Ground Floor Proposed, 225 (01) 201 Section 01, 225 (01) 251 Rear Proposed,  225 (00) 251 Rear Existing, Archaeological Desk Based Assessment, Basement Impact Assessment DMAG-24-09-BIA, Cover Letter 05/03/24, Design and Access Statement, Flood Risk Assessment DMAG-2409-FRA, Structural Method Statement DMAG-24-09-SMS, Basement Impact Assessment Audit September 2024. \r\n\r\nReason: For the avoidance of doubt and in the interest of proper planning.\r\n",
    "Condition : 3 - All new external work shall be carried out in materials that resemble, as closely as possible, in colour and texture those of the existing building, unless otherwise specified in the approved application. \r\n\r\nReason: To safeguard the appearance of the premises and the character of the immediate area in accordance with the requirements of policies D1 and D2 of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017. \r\n",
    "Condition : 4 - No development shall take place until full details of hard and soft landscaping and means of enclosure of all un-built, open areas have been submitted to and approved by the local planning authority in writing. Such details shall include details of any proposed earthworks including grading, mounding and other changes in ground levels. The relevant part of the works shall not be carried out otherwise than in accordance with the details thus approved. \r\n\r\nReason: To ensure that the development achieves a high quality of landscaping which contributes to the visual amenity and character of the area in accordance with the requirements of policies A2, A3, A5, D1 and D2 of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017. \r\n",
    "Condition : 5 - All hard and soft landscaping works shall be carried out in accordance with the approved landscape details by not later than the end of the planting season following completion of the development or any phase of the development. Any trees or areas of planting (including trees existing at the outset of the development other than those indicated to be removed) which, within a period of 5 years from the completion of the development, die, are removed or become seriously damaged or diseased, shall be replaced as soon as is reasonably possible and, in any case, by not later than the end of the following planting season, with others of similar size and species, unless the local planning authority gives written consent to any variation.\r\n\r\nReason: To ensure that the landscaping is carried out within a reasonable period and to maintain a high quality of visual amenity in the scheme in accordance with the requirements of policies A2, A3, A5, D1 and D2 of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n",
    "Condition : 6 - The development hereby approved shall not commence until such time as a suitably qualified chartered engineer with membership of the appropriate professional body has been appointed to inspect, check for compliance with the design (as approved by the local planning authority and building control body) and monitor the critical elements of both permanent and temporary basement construction works throughout their duration. Details of the appointment and the appointee's responsibilities shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority prior to the commencement of development. Any subsequent change or reappointment shall be confirmed forthwith for the duration of the construction works.�\n\n�\r\n\r\n\n\nReason: To ensure proper consideration of the structural stability of neighbouring buildings and to safeguard the appearance and character of the immediate area in accordance with the requirements of policies D1, D2 and A5 of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n",
    "Condition : 7 - The development shall not be carried out other than in strict accordance with the methodologies, recommendations and requirements of the Basement Impact Assessment (Basement Impact Assessment DMAG-24-09-BIA) hereby approved, and the confirmation at the detailed design stage that the damage impact assessment would be limited to Burland Category 1.�\n\n\r\n�\r\n\n\nReason: To ensure proper consideration of the structural stability of neighbouring buildings and to safeguard the appearance and character of the immediate area in accordance with the requirements of policies D1, D2 and A5 of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n\r\n",
    "Condition : 8 - Prior to commencement of development, full details of the sustainable drainage system shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority. Such a system should be designed to accommodate all storms up to and including a 1:100 year storm with a 40% provision for climate change such that flooding does not occur in any part of a building or in any utility plant susceptible to water, or on any part of the entire development site for up to and including a 1:30 year storm.  The details shall demonstrate that the peak surface water runoff rate for a 1:100 year +40% climate change storm event can achieve a betterment of at least 25% (not more than 17.1l/s), and as close to as practically possible to the greenfield run-off rate, and will then be approved by the Local Planning Authority. An up to date drainage statement, SuDS pro-forma, a lifetime maintenance plan and supporting evidence should be provided including:\r\nA)\tThe proposed SuDS or drainage measures with consideration of incorporating rainwater harvesting such as wall tank or water butt, and soft-landscaping (at the front garden area) unless demonstrated not feasible;  \r\nB)\tStorage capacities if rainwater harvesting is proposed;\r\nC)\tUpdated proposed peak surface water runoff rates or volumes; and\r\nD)\tAll the proposed flood mitigation measures should be kept, including threshold drains, with required installation of non-return valves on basement floor drainage. Other resilience measures should also be incorporated unless demonstrated not feasible, such as raised level of electrical wiring, appliances/utility metres, and where applicable at the front of the property flood protection such as raised thresholds (with 300mm freeboard).\r\n\r\nReason: To reduce the rate of surface water run-off from the buildings and limit the impact on the storm-water drainage system in accordance with Policies CC2 and CC3 of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan and Policy SI 13 of the London Plan 2021.\r\n",
    "Condition : 9 - Prior to commencement of development, full details of the waterproofing to the basement shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority.\r\n\r\nReason: To ensure proper consideration of the structural stability of neighbouring buildings and to safeguard the appearance and character of the immediate area in accordance with the requirements of policies D1, D2 and A5 of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n"
