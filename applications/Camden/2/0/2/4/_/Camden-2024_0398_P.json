    "Reason : 1 - 1.\tThe proposed extension to the rear, by reason of its demolition of historic fabric, erosion of historic circulation and planform, and the visual impact of the proposed extension upon the historic character and appearance of the rear elevation would fail to be a subordinate and sensitive addition to the host listed building, with inappropriate design and materials. It would therefore result in harm to the listed building in respect of its historic circulation, planform and spatial quality and to the legibility and fabric of the historic rear elevation, to the detriment of the significance and character of the host building, contrary to policy D1 (Design) and D2 (Heritage) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017."
