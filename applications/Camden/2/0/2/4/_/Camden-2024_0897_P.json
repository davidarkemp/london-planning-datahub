    "Reason : 1 - The proposed extension to the existing dormer by reason of its design, bulk, and width would be detrimental to the character and appearance of the host building, streetscene and Conservation area. The proposal is therefore contrary to policies D1 (Design) and D2 (Heritage) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017. The proposal would also be contrary to Camden's Home Improvements CPG guidance document. ",
    "Reason : 2 - In the absence of a noise impact assessment the submission has failed to demonstrate that the noise-generating machinery proposed within the development, meets Camden noise guidelines and Noise Policy Statement for England, National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF). Overall the proposal fails to comply with policies A1 (Managing the impact of development) and A4 (Noise and vibration) of the 2017 Camden Local Plan. ",
    "Reason : 3 - In the absence of a Cooling strategy, the submission has failed to justify the need for active cooling by reducing and mitigating the impact of dwelling overheating,, thereby failing to minimise carbon dioxide emissions, contrary to policies CC1 (Climate change mitigation) and CC2 (Climate change adaptation measures) of the Camden Local Plan 2017."
