    "Reason : 1 - Reason for Refusal - \r\n\r\nThe proposal, by reason of its demolition of historic fabric, erosion of evidential value, and the visual impact of the proposed balcony and enlarged terrace upon the historic character and appearance of the rear elevation, would fail to preserve the special architectural and historic interest of the host listed building. It would therefore result in harm to the merits of the listed building to the detriment of the significance and character of the Conservation Area contrary to policy D2 (Heritage) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.  It would also be contrary to the London Plan 2021 and the NPPF 2024. "
