    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development, by reason of its combined height, mass, extent of site coverage and its detailed design would fail to respect the context and character of the area, including the adjacent Camden Square Conservation Area and it would harm the setting, character, landscape value and openness of the adjacent open space and trees of Cantelowes Gardens contrary to policies A2 (Open Space), A3 (Biodiversity), D1 (Design) and D2 (Heritage) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017 and policies D3 (Design Principles), GO1 (Local Green Spaces) and SSP7 (Small sites and infill developments) of the Kentish Town Neighbourhoood Plan 2016.\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed development, by reason of only providing 1 bedroom units and failing to contribute to the creation of mixed, inclusive and sustainable communities and addressing the mismatch between housing needs and existing supply is contrary to policy H7 (Large and small homes) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement binding the \r\napplicant to the provision of the requisite provision of affordable housing, would fail to meet the Council's requirements for the provision of affordable housing in new residential development and would therefore be contrary to policy H4 of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n",
    "Reason : 4 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement including an undertaking to a car free development by way of the prevention of future occupiers from obtaining on-street resident parking permits, would fail to represent a sustainable form of development which would seek to reduce car use in the Borough. It would therefore be contrary to policies T1, T2, and CC1 of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n",
    "Reason : 5 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement including an undertaking to a highways contribution for removing the crossover, reinstating the footway over and repaving the adjacent footway to repair any damage caused, would fail to maintain the efficiency of the transport infrastructure. It would therefore be contrary to policy T4 of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n",
    "Reason : 6 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement including a Vehicle Maintenance Unit Operational Statement for the adjoining car repair workshop which currently uses the site for car parking, would potentially result in over-spill parking and vehicular activity on adjacent roads harmful to the safety of the highway network. It would therefore be contrary to policy T3 of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n",
    "Reason : 7 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement including an undertaking to a Construction Management Plan and associated Implementation Support Contribution and Impact Bond, would fail to mitigate against adverse impacts on the safety of the highway and the amenity of neighbouring occupiers during construction. It would therefore be contrary to policies A1 and T4 of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n"
