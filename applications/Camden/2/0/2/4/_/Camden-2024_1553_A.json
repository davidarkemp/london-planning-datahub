    "Condition : 2 - No advertisement shall be sited or displayed so as to\r\n(a) endanger persons using any highway, railway, waterway, dock, harbour or aerodrome (civil or military);\r\n(b) obscure, or hinder the ready interpretation of any traffic sign, railway signal or aid to navigation by water or air; or\r\n(c) hinder the operation of any device used for the purpose of security or surveillance or for measuring the speed of any vehicle\r\n\r\nReason: - As required by regulation 2(1) and Schedule 2 of the Town & Country Planning (Control of Advertisements) (England) Regulations 2007.\r\n",
    "Condition : 3 - Any advertisement displayed and any site used for the display of advertisements, shall be maintained in a condition that does not impair the visual amenity of the site.\r\n\r\nReason: - As required by regulation 2(1) and Schedule 2 of the Town & Country Planning (Control of Advertisements) (England) Regulations 2007.\r\n",
    "Condition : 4 - Any structure or hoarding erected or used principally for the purpose of displaying advertisements shall be maintained in a safe condition.\r\n\r\nReason: - As required by regulation 2(1) and Schedule 2 of the Town & Country Planning (Control of Advertisements) (England) Regulations 2007.\r\n",

    "Condition : 6 - The advertisement display shall be statically illuminated and the intensity of the illumination of the digital sign shall not exceed 500 candelas per square metre during the day and 300 candelas per square metre during the hours of darkness. The levels of luminance on the digital sign should be controlled by light sensors to measure the ambient brightness and dimmers to control the lighting output to within these limits.\r\n\r\nReason: To ensure that the advertisement does not harm the character and appearance of the area and does not create a distraction to pedestrian or vehicular traffic and therefore cause a hazard to highway safety. In accordance with the requirements of policies D4, D1, A1 and T1 of the Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n"
