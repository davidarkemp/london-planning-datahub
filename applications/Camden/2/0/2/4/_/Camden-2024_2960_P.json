    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development fails to include a replacement tree of a sufficient species, size and siting to replace the formerly protected TPO Ash tree (which has been removed without consent from the site). The proposal therefore fails to compensate for the loss of a significant tree of amenity value to the area contrary to policy A3 of the Camden Local Plan and policy 18 of the Fortune Green and West Hampstead Neighbourhood Plan 2015.  It is also contrary to the London Plan 2021 and NPPF 2024.\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement securing car-free housing, would be likely to contribute unacceptably to parking stress and congestion in the surrounding area and fail to encourage the use of sustainable modes of transport, contrary to policies T1 (Prioritising walking, cycling and public transport) and T2 (parking and car-free development) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017. It is also contrary to the London Plan 2021 and NPPF 2024.\r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement to secure a Construction Management Plan and associated Implementation Support Contribution and Impact Bond financial contribution would fail to mitigate against the highway safety/efficiency and amenity impacts of the  works on the adjacent public highway and in the surrounding area contrary to policies A1 (Managing the impact of development), T3 (Transport Infrastructure) and DM1 (Delivery and monitoring) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.  It is also contrary to the London Plan 2021 and NPPF 2024.\r\n",
    "Reason : 4 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement to secure a financial contribution towards the requisite highway works, would fail to mitigate the impact of the construction works on the adjacent public highway, contrary to policies A1 (Managing the impact of development), T3 (Transport Infrastructure) and DM1 (Delivery and monitoring) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.  It is also contrary to the London Plan 2021 and NPPF 2024.\r\n"
