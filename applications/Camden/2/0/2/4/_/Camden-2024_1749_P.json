    "Reason : 1 - The removal of the existing window and replacement double glazed window, by reason of its appearance, frame thickness, detailed design, and loss of historic fabric (in the absence of evidence to prove otherwise), would represent unsympathetic addition to the listed building, disrupting its elevational composition and causing less than substantial harm to its character, appearance and significance. The proposal is therefore contrary to policies D1 (Design) and D2 (Heritage) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed Victorian style black and white tiles to the front forecourt by reason of their design and material would represent unsympathetic addition causing less than substantial harm to its character, appearance and significance of the listed building and harming the character and appearance of the streetscene. The proposal is therefore contrary to policies D1 (Design) and D2 (Heritage) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017."
