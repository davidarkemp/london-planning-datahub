    "Reason : 1 - The proposed loss of a valued public house and replacement with a residential unit, would undermine the functioning of a concentration of night-time economy uses which bring wider benefits to the vibrancy and vitality of Camden's Central London Area and local economies and fail to meet the needs of the community, contrary to Policy C4 (Public houses) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017 and Policy HC7 (Protecting public houses) of the London Plan 2021. \r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed development, by reason of  the resultant loss of an existing business premises which has not been demonstrated as incapable of continued occupation or reoccupation, would have a detrimental effect on employment opportunities in the Borough contrary to Policy E2 (Employment premises and sites) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017 and Principle 4 (Small and Medium Enterprises) of the Fitzrovia Area Action Plan 2014.\r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed residential unit by reason of its small internal floor area, would provide a substandard level of accommodation to future occupiers, contrary to policy H6 (Housing choice and mix) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n",
    "Reason : 4 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement securing car-free housing, would contribute to parking stress and congestion in the surrounding area and fail to promote more sustainable and efficient forms of transport and active lifestyles, contrary to Policies T2 (Parking and car-free development) and DM1 (Delivery and monitoring) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n",
    "Reason : 5 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement securing a cycle parking contribution, would fail to promote more sustainable and efficient forms of transport and active lifestyles, contrary to Policies T1 (Prioritising walking, cycling and public transport) and DM1 (Delivery and monitoring) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n",
    "Reason : 6 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement securing an Agent of Change clause to ensure future occupiers of the proposed studio flat would be aware of and understand the potential noise impacts from nearby uses, would fail to protect the night-time economy by protecting evening and night-time cultural venues, contrary to policy A4 (Noise and vibration) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017 and policies HC6 (Supporting the night-time economy) and D13 (Agent of change) of the London Plan 2021.  \r\n"
