    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development, by virtue of the substantial demolition of the existing positively contributing building as well as the absence of demolition plans, the unsympathetic and incongruous front extension and overly prominent roof addition, would be harmful to the character and appearance of the Camden Square Conservation Area and the wider streetscape.  It would therefore be contrary to policies D1 (design) and D2 (heritage) of the Camden Local Plan 2017. ",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed development, through insufficient evidence to justify the demolition of the existing building, would result in an unsustainable development that fails to contribute to a low carbon future through efficient use of resources, contrary to policy CC1 (climate change mitigation) of the Camden Local Plan 2017, policy SI7 of the London Plan 2021, and the NPPF 2024. ",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement securing a Construction Management Plan (CMP), associated contributions to support the implementation of the CMP, and an impact bond, would be likely to give rise to conflicts with other road users and be detrimental to the amenities of the area generally, contrary to policies A1 (Managing the impact of development), T4 (Sustainable movement of goods and materials) and DM1 (Delivery and monitoring) of the Camden Local Plan 2017",
