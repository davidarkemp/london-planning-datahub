    "Reason : 1 - The proposed extract flue, timber screening on the Islip Street elevation and storage buildings on the roof by reason of their, design, location, height and visibility would be detrimental to the character and appearance of the locally listed building, streetscene and surrounding area. The proposal is therefore contrary to policies D1 (Design) and D2 (Heritage) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017 and Policy D3 of the Kentish Town Neighbourhood Plan 2016. ",
    "Reason : 2 - In the absence of an air quality assessment within an identified location of 'poor quality' it has not been satisfactorily demonstrated that the proposed works would not cause an adverse impact on air quality in the area contrary to policy A1 of the Camden Local Plan 2017.",
    "Reason : 3 - The development has the potential to result in unacceptable levels of harm to neighbouring residents� living conditions through noise pollution, vibration and harmful levels of odour contrary to policies A1 (Managing the impact of development) and A4 (Noise and vibration) of the Council�s Local Plan adopted in 2017."
