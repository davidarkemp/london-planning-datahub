    "Condition : 1 - The development hereby permitted must be begun not later than the end of three years from the date of this permission.\r\n\r\nReason: In order to comply with the provisions of Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended).\r\n\r\n",
    "Condition : 2 - The development hereby permitted shall be carried out in accordance with the following approved plans: \r\n\r\nEX000; EX001; EX002; EX003; EX004; EX005; EX101; EX201; EX202; EX203; EX204; PA001; PA002 Rev A; PA003 Rev B; PA004 Rev A; PA005 Rev A; PA101; PA102; PA201 Rev A; PA202 Rev D; PA203 Rev A and PA204 Rev A\r\n\r\nReason: For the avoidance of doubt and in the interest of proper planning.\r\n",
    "Condition : 3 - All new external work shall be carried out in materials that resemble, as closely as possible, in colour and texture those of the existing building, unless otherwise specified in the approved application. \r\n\r\nReason: To safeguard the appearance of the premises and the character of the immediate area in accordance with the requirements of policies D1 and D2 of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017 and policies DC2, DC3 and DC4 of the Dartmouth Park Neighbourhood Plan 2020.\r\n",
    "Condition : 4 - If during construction/demolition works, evidence of potential contamination is encountered, works shall cease and the site fully assessed to enable an appropriate remediation plan to be developed. Works shall not recommence until an appropriate remediation scheme has been submitted to, and approved in writing by, the local planning authority and the remediation has been completed. Upon completion of the building works, this condition shall not be discharged until a closure report has been submitted to, and improved in writing by, the local planning authority.\r\n\r\nReason: To protect future occupiers of the development from the possible presence of ground contamination arising in connection with the adjacent railway use close to the site in accordance with policies G1, D1, A1, and DM1 of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.   \r\n"
