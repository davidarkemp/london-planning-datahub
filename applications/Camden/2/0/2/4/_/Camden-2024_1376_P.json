    "Reason : 1 - The proposed two storey rear extension, rear basement extension, rear lightwell, and replacement windows, by reason of their design, bulk, scale, siting, and materiality would result in harm to the special interest and significance of the Grade II listed building, wider terrace group and the character and appearance of the Camden Town Conservation Area, contrary to policies D1 (Design) and D2 (Heritage) of the Camden Local Plan (2017).\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - In the absence of a Sunlight & Daylight Assessment, the proposed two storey rear extension, by way of its size, siting and design, would result in undue overshadowing and enclosure of the lightwell/room(s) at the rear of 159 Arlington Road, contrary to policy A1 (Managing the impact of development) of the Camden Local Plan (2017).\r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - Due to its size and siting, the proposed basement extension and lightwell thereto would be excessive and inappropriate to the historic and architectural merits of the Listed Building and the character and appearance of the Conservation Area, contrary to policy A5 (Basements) of the Camden Local Plan (2017).\r\n",
    "Reason : 4 - In the absence of a Basement Impact Assessment authored by a suitably qualified  engineer and without mitigation measures to demonstrate sufficiently that the proposal would safeguard ground and water conditions, the proposal is therefore contrary to policy A5 (Basements) of the Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n"
