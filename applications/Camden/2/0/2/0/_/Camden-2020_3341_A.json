  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - Reason for Refusal:\r\n\r\nThe proposed LED digital advertising screen, by reason of its size, scale, design, location and method of illumination,  would be an incongruous and dominant feature. The advertising screen would create visual clutter through the introduction of an illuminated fixture at high level which would have a detrimental impact to the character and appearance of Euston Circus. Therefore, the commercial advertising screen would fail to preserve or enhance the visual amenity of the area contrary to policies D4 (Advertisements) and A1 (Amenity).\r\n\r\n"
