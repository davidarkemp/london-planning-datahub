    "Reason : 1 - The proposed change of use, in the absence of an appropriate marketing exercise, fails to demonstrate that the premises are no longer suitable for continued B1 use. The proposal therefore results in the loss of B1 employment premises for small businesses, businesses and services that provide employment for Camden residents, support the functioning of the Central Activities Zone (CAZ) and the local economy contrary to policies E1 (Economic Development) and E2 (Employment Premises and Sites) of the Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed use, by reason of its associated noise and general disturbance to adjacent residential occupants would be contrary to policies A1 (Managing the impact of development), A4 (Noise and vibration), TC2 (Camden's centres and other shopping areas) and TC4 (Town Centre uses) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017\r\n"
