  "description": "Erection of a mansard roof extension to provide two 1 bedroom flats",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed roof extension, by reason of its, design, height, scale, bulk and materials would be detrimental to the character and appearance of the host building and surrounding area. The proposal would neither preserve nor enhance the Camden Town Conservation Area and would therefore be contrary to policies D1 and D2 of Camden Council's Local Plan 2017 and Design CPG and to the National Planning Policy Framework 2019, the London Plan 2016 and The Publication London Plan 2020. ",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed roof extension, due to its size, siting, height and scale, would have a detrimental impact on the amenity of occupiers at Nos.40 and 44 Camden High Street inregards to loss of daylight, poor outlook and privacy impacts. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies A1 and D1 of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017 and to the National Planning Policy Framework 2019, the London Plan 2016 and The Publication London Plan 2020. \r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposal development, in the absence of a legal agreement securing car-free housing, would be likely to contribute unacceptably to parking stress and congestion in the surrounding area, contrary to Policies T1, T2 and T3 of the Camden Local Plan, 2017. ",
    "Reason : 4 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement securing a Construction Management Plan and CMP Bond, would be likely to contribute unacceptably to traffic disruption and be detrimental to general highway and pedestrian safety, contrary to Policies A1 (Managing the impact of development) and T4 (Sustainable movement of goods and materials) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n",
    "Reason : 5 - The proposed development, without the provision of an affordable housing contribution, would fail to maximise the contribution to the supply of affordable housing in the borough, contrary to policy H4 (Maximising the supply of affordable housing) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017"
