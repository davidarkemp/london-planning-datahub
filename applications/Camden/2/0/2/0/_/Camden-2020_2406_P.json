  "description": "Erection of 7th of roof extension to facilitate the creation of 27 student accommodation rooms (Sui Generis) to existing student accommodation",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development, by virtue of its height, mass, scale and detailed design, would be detrimental to the character and appearance of the host building, streetscene and wider area while failing to either preserve or enhance the character and appearance of the adjacent Inkerman Conservation Area, contrary to policies D1 (Design) and D2 (Heritage) of the Camden Local Plan 2017, and policy D3 of the Kentish Town Neighbourhood Forum Neighbourhood Plan 2016. ",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed development, by reason of the poor level of outlook and ventilation to the proposed studios, would fail to provide adequate internal living conditions for the perspective occupiers, resulting in substandard accommodation that would be harmful to the amenities of future occupiers, contrary to policies D1 (Design and A1 (Amenity) of the Camden Local Plan 2017 and policy 3.5 of the London Plan 2016. ",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed development, due to its height, massing, scale and location, would result in a material loss of outlook as well as having an overbearing \r\nimpact and an increased sense of enclosure on the occupiers at  74 and 55-57 Holmes Road, contrary to policy A1 of the Camden Local Plan 2017. ",
    "Reason : 4 - The proposed development, in the absence of sufficent reductions at the Be Lean stage, an adequate BREEAM assessment and failure to meet BREEAM Excellent, and due to the absence of a legal agreement to secure any of the above, would fail to be sustainable in its use of resources, contrary to policies CC1 (Climate change mitigation), CC2 (Adapting to climate) and CC3 (Water and flooding) of the Camden Local Plan 2017.  \r\n",
    "Reason : 5 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement securing a student management plan, would fail to protect the amenities of the surrounding area contrary to policies A1 (Managing the impact of development) and DM1 (Delivery and monitoring) of Camden Local Plan 2017. \r\n",
    "Reason : 6 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement for defining that the occupation of the student units would be restricted to students in full or part time higher education at specific education institutions and no part of the property to be sold as a separate self-contained unit, would fail to supply appropriate student housing and lead to accommodation that would be inappropriate for private use, contrary to policies H9 (Student Housing) and D1 (Design) of Camden Local Plan 2017. \r\n",
    "Reason : 7 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement to secure a \r\nConstruction Management Plan, would be likely to give rise to conflicts with other road users, and be detrimental to the amenities of the area generally, contrary to policies A1 (Managing the impact of development) and DM1 (Delivery and monitoring) of Camden Local Plan 2017. \r\n",
    "Reason : 8 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement to secure highway contributions to undertake external works outside the application site, would fail to secure adequate provision for the safety of pedestrians, cyclists and vehicles, contrary to policies A1 (Managing the impact of development), T1 (Prioritising walking, cycling and public transport) and DM1 (Delivery and monitoring) of Camden Local Plan 2017. \r\n",
    "Reason : 9 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement to secure a car-free development, would be likely to contribute unacceptably to parking stress and congestion in the surrounding area, contrary to policies T1 (Prioritising walking, cycling and public transport), T2 (Parking and car-free development) and DM1 (Delivery and monitoring) of Camden Local Plan 2017. \r\n",
    "Reason : 10 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement to secure a Student Travel Plan, would be likely to give rise to significantly increased car-borne trips and would result in a unsustainable form of development, contrary to policies T1 (Prioritising walking, cycling and public transport) and DM1 (Delivery and monitoring) of Camden Local Plan 2017. \r\n",
    "Reason : 11 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement to secure contributions for public open space, would be likely to contribute to pressure and demand on the existing open space in this area contrary to policies A2 (Open Space) and DM1 (Delivery and monitoring) of Camden Local Plan 2017. \r\n",
    "Reason : 12 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement to secure  a local employment and apprenticeships agreement will be likely to lead to the exacerbation of local skill shortages and lack of training opportunities and would fail to contribute to the regeneration of the area, contrary to policies E1 (Economic Development) and DM1 (Delivery and monitoring) of Camden Local Plan 2017. \r\n"
