    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development, due to its siting, would occupy the site of a previously protected TPO Ash tree (which has been removed without consent from the site).  The proposal therefore perpetuates the loss of a significant tree of amenity value, and would prevent adequate replanting,  contrary to policy A3 of the Camden Local Plan and policy 18 of the Fortune Green and West Hampstead Neighbourhood Plan 2015. \r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed development, by way of its lack of accessible and convenient cycle parking facilities would fail to promote the use of sustainable methods of transport.  It is therefore contrary to policies T1, T2 and CC1 of the Camden Local Plan and policy 8 of the Fortune Green and West Hampstead Neighbourhood Plan 2015.\r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement securing car- capped housing, would be likely to contribute unacceptably to parking stress and congestion in the surrounding area and fail to encourage the use of sustainable modes of transport, contrary to policies T1 (Prioritising walking, cycling and public transport) and T2 (parking and car-free development) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n\r\n",
    "Reason : 4 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement to secure a financial contribution towards the requisite highway works, would fail to mitigate the impact of the construction works on the adjacent public highway, contrary to policies A1 (Managing the impact of development), T3 (Transport Infrastructure) and DM1 (Delivery and monitoring) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017"
