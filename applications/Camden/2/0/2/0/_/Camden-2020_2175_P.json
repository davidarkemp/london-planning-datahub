As such the proposal is contrary to policies D1 (Design) and D2 (Heritage) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan (2017) and  policies DH1 (Design) and DH2 (Conservation areas and listed building) of the Hampstead Neighbourhood Plan (2018).\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed enlarged ground floor rear roof terrace, by reason of is siting and design would afford new views into the rear windows of No. 92 South Hill Park and would result in an undue loss of privacy. As such the proposal is contrary to policy A1 (Managing the impact of development) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan (2017) and policy DH1 (Design) of the Hampstead Neighbourhood Plan (2020).\r\n"
