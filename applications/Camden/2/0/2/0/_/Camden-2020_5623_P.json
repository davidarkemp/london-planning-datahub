  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - Large-scale hotel \r\n\r\nThe proposed development includes the provision of a large-scale hotel outside the Central London Area or a Town Centre, which is considered to be an inappropriate location given the large numbers of people it would attract, and is likely to result in harm to the quieter more residential nature of the surrounding area character of the area, contrary to Policy E3 (Tourism) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.",
    "Reason : 2 - Loss of approved housing\r\n\r\nThe proposed development would result in the loss of housing, which has the potential to be delivered through an approved and implemented planning permission for this site, housing is the priority use of the Local Plan and this alternative development proposal would have a detrimental impact on meeting housing need and targets, contrary to Policy H1 (Maximising housing supply) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - Road Safety Audit\r\n\r\nThe proposals, in the absence of a Road Safety Audit, which demonstrates that the proposed servicing would not increase road danger, are contrary to Camden Local Plan 2017 policies T1 and T3.\r\n",
    "Reason : 4 - Energy/Sustainability\r\n\r\nThe proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement to secure the details set out on the sustainability and energy plans, a BREEAM pre-assessment and a carbon offset contribution, would be likely to contribute to climate change, contrary to policies CC1 (Climate change mitigation), CC2 (Adapting to climate change), CC3 (Water and flooding), CC4 (Air quality), C1 (Health and wellbeing) and DM1 (Delivery and monitoring of the London Borough of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.",
    "Reason : 5 - Car-free\r\n\r\nThe proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement to secure a car-free development, would be likely to contribute unacceptably to parking stress, environmental impacts and congestion in the surrounding area, contrary to policies T1 (Prioritising walking, cycling and public transport), T2 (Parking and car-free development), CC1 (Climate change mitigation) and DM1 (Delivery and monitoring) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.    ",
    "Reason : 6 - Public highways works\r\n\r\nThe proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement to secure an appropriate financial contribution towards public highway works, would be likely to harm the Borough's transport and public realm infrastructure, contrary to policies T1 (Prioritising walking, cycling and public transport), T3 (Transport Infrastructure), A1 (Managing the impact of development) and DM1 (Delivery and monitoring) of London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.  ",
    "Reason : 7 - Pedestrian, cyclist and environmental works\r\n\r\nThe proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement to secure financial contributions towards pedestrian, cyclist and environmental improvements in the area, would fail to mitigate the impact of the development created by increased trips, contrary to policies T1 (Prioritising walking, cycling and public transport), A1 (Managing the impact of development) and DM1 (Delivery and monitoring) of London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.  ",
    "Reason : 8 - Delivery Servicing Management Plan\r\n\r\nThe proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement securing a Delivery and Servicing Management Plan for the commercial element, would likely give rise to conflicts with other road users and be detrimental to the amenities of the area generally, contrary to policies G1 (Delivery and location of growth), A1 (Managing the impact of development), T3 (Transport Infrastructure), T4 (Sustainable movement of goods and materials), DM1 (Delivery and monitoring), A4 (Noise and Vibration) and CC4 (Air quality) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.",
    "Reason : 9 - Construction Management Plan\r\n\r\nThe proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement to secure a Construction Management Plan, construction impact bond and a financial contribution for construction management plan monitoring, would be likely to give rise to conflicts with other road users and be detrimental to the amenities of the area generally, contrary to policies G1 (Delivery and location of growth), A1 (Managing the impact of development), T3 (Transport Infrastructure), T4 (Sustainable movement of goods and materials), DM1 (Delivery and monitoring), A4 (Noise and Vibration) and CC4 (Air quality) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.",
    "Reason : 10 - Strategic Level Travel Plan\r\n\r\nThe proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement for a Strategic Level Travel Plan and financial contributions for the associated monitoring, would be likely to give rise to conflicts with other road users and be detrimental to the amenities of the area generally, contrary to policies G1 (Delivery and location of growth), A1 (Managing the impact of development), T3 (Transport Infrastructure), DM1 (Delivery and monitoring), A4 (Noise and Vibration) and CC4 (Air quality) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.",
    "Reason : 11 - Local employment and training\r\n\r\nThe proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement securing a local employment and training package including an appropriate financial contribution, would be likely to lead to the exacerbation of local skill shortages and lack of training opportunities and would fail to contribute to the regeneration of the area, contrary to policies G1 (Delivery and location of growth), E1 (Economic development) and DM1 (Delivery and monitoring) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.  ",
    "Reason : 12 - Hotel Management Plan\r\n\r\nThe proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement securing a Hotel Management Plan, would be likely to give rise to conflicts with other road users and be detrimental to the amenities of the area generally contrary to policies A1 (Managing the impact of development), T3 (Transport infrastructure) and DM1 (Delivery and monitoring) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.",
    "Reason : 13 - Affordable housing\r\n\r\nThe proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement to secure affordable housing, would be contrary to policy H4 (Maximising the supply of affordable housing) of the Camden Local Plan 2017.  "
