    "Reason : 1 - The existing local public house, in its current form, is considered to serve the needs of the local community. Its proposed modification would compromise and undermine the use of the existing public house and prejudice its long term retention. Therefore the public house would fail to be developed and modernised in a way that is sustainable, and retained for the benefit of the community, which in turn would fail to enhance the sustainability of communities, contrary to policies C2 (Community facilities) and C4 (Public houses) of the Local Plan (2017), the London Plan (2021) and the NPPF (2021).\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - Due to the undersized single bedrooms on the second floor, lack of wash basins, and the poor stacking of similar room types, the proposed development would result in sub-standard accommodation and be harmful to the amenity of future occupiers contrary to policies A1 (Managing the impact of development), H6 (Housing choice and mix) and H10 (Housing with shared facilities) of the Local Plan (2017), the London Plan (2021) and the NPPF (2021). \r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement to secure a car- free development, would be likely to contribute unacceptably to parking stress and congestion in the surrounding area, contrary to policies T1 (Prioritising walking, cycling, and public transport) and T2 (Parking and car-free development) of the Local Plan (2017), the London Plan (2021) and the NPPF (2021).\r\n",
    "Reason : 4 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement securing a HMO management plan, would fail to protect the safety of neighbouring residents and the amenities of the surrounding area contrary to policies A1 (Managing the impact of development), C5 (Safety and security) and DM1 (Delivery and monitoring) of the Local Plan (2017), the London Plan (2021) and the NPPF (2021).\r\n"
