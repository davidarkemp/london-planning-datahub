  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development, due to the failure to provide adequate replacement employment space on the site, would fail to support growth in economic activity in Camden and result in the loss of employment opportunities within the borough contrary to Policies E1 (Economic development) and E2 (Employment premises and sites) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed development, by virtue of its height, mass, scale and footprint, would be detrimental to the streetscene, setting of the nearby listed buildings and the character and appearance of the wider area, contrary to policies D1 (Design) and D2 (Heritage) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.\n",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed development, due to its height, massing, scale and location, would result in a material loss of light and outlook as well as having an overbearing impact and an increased sense of enclosure on the occupiers of Winchester Apartments and users of Netley Primary School's external amenity space, contrary to policy A1 (Managing the impact of development) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.   \n",
    "Reason : 4 - A number of the student accommodation units within the proposed development, by reason of their poor levels of outlook, light, internal space, accessibility, external amenity space and ventilation, would fail to provide adequate internal living conditions for future occupiers, resulting in substandard accommodation contrary to policies D1 (Design), A1 (Managing the impact of development) H6 (Housing choice and mix) and H9 (student housing) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.\n",
    "Reason : 5 - The proposed development, in the absence of a whole life-cycle carbon assessment and circular economy statement, has failed to demonstrate that the proposed substantial demolition is justified or that the proposal would promote circular economy outcomes contrary to policy CC1 of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017 and policies SI2 and SI7 of the London Plan 2021.\n",
    "Reason : 6 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement to secure a car-free development, would be likely to contribute unacceptably to parking stress, environmental impacts and congestion in the surrounding area, contrary to policies T1 (Prioritising walking, cycling and public transport), T2 (Parking and car-free development), CC1 (Climate change mitigation) and DM1 (Delivery and monitoring) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.    \n",
    "Reason : 7 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement to secure an appropriate financial contribution towards public highway works, would be likely to harm the Borough's transport and public realm infrastructure, contrary to policies T1 (Prioritising walking, cycling and public transport), T3 (Transport Infrastructure), A1 (Managing the impact of development) and DM1 (Delivery and monitoring) of London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.  \n",
    "Reason : 8 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement to secure financial contributions towards pedestrian, cyclist and environmental improvements in the area, would fail to mitigate the impact of the development created by increased trips, contrary to policies T1 (Prioritising walking, cycling and public transport), A1 (Managing the impact of development) and DM1 (Delivery and monitoring) of London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.  \n",
    "Reason : 9 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement securing an Approval in Principle Report and appropriate financial contribution towards an approval in principle would fail to mitigate the impact of the basement works on the adjacent public highway contrary to policies T3 (Transport Infrastructure) and DM1 (Delivery and monitoring) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.\n",
    "Reason : 10 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement securing a Delivery and Servicing Management Plan for the commercial element, would likely give rise to conflicts with other road users and be detrimental to the amenities of the area generally, contrary to policies G1 (Delivery and location of growth), A1 (Managing the impact of development), T3 (Transport Infrastructure), T4 (Sustainable movement of goods and materials), DM1 (Delivery and monitoring), A4 (Noise and Vibration) and CC4 (Air quality) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.\n",
    "Reason : 11 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement for a Student Travel Plan, Strategic Level Travel Plan (student accommodation) and Local Level Travel Plan (affordable workspace) and financial contributions for the associated monitoring, would be likely to give rise to conflicts with other road users and be detrimental to the amenities of the area generally, contrary to policies G1 (Delivery and location of growth), A1 (Managing the impact of development), T3 (Transport Infrastructure), DM1 (Delivery and monitoring), A4 (Noise and Vibration) and CC4 (Air quality) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.\n",
    "Reason : 12 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement to secure a construction management plan, construction impact bond and a financial contribution for construction management plan monitoring, would be likely to give rise to conflicts with other road users and be detrimental to the amenities of the area generally, contrary to policies G1 (Delivery and location of growth), A1 (Managing the impact of development), T3 (Transport Infrastructure), T4 (Sustainable movement of goods and materials), DM1 (Delivery and monitoring), A4 (Noise and Vibration) and CC4 (Air quality) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.\n",
    "Reason : 13 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement securing a local employment and training package including an appropriate financial contribution, would be likely to lead to the exacerbation of local skill shortages and lack of training opportunities and would fail to contribute to the regeneration of the area, contrary to policies G1 (Delivery and location of growth), E1 (Economic development) and DM1 (Delivery and monitoring) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.  \n",
    "Reason : 14 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement securing a carbon off-set contribution; an Energy Efficiency Plan and Renewable Energy Plan including the measures set out in the Energy Strategy; details regarding the feasibility of connecting to a decentralised energy network; and a Sustainability Plan including Design Stage and Post Construction stage BREEAM assessment reports and certificates, demonstrating compliance with targets, would fail to be sustainable in its use of resources, contrary to policies CC1 (Climate change mitigation), CC2 (Adapting to climate change), CC3 (Water and flooding), CC4 (Air quality), C1 (Health and wellbeing) and DM1 (Delivery and monitoring of the London Borough of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.\n",
    "Reason : 15 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement to secure financial contributions towards public open space, would be likely to contribute to pressure and demand on the existing open space in this area contrary to policies A2 (Open Space) and DM1 (Delivery and monitoring) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.\n",
    "Reason : 16 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement securing a student management plan, would be likely to give rise to conflicts with other road users and be detrimental to the amenities of the area generally contary to policies A1 (Managing the impact of development), T3 (Transport infrastructure) and DM1 (Delivery and monitoring) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.\n",
    "Reason : 17 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement restricting the term-time occupation of the student units to students in higher education at publicly-funded  education institutions that are accessible from the development,  would fail to meet the identified need for student housing in sustainable locations, and fail to provide a range of affordable, accessible and adaptable dwellings appropriate to meet wider housing needs , contrary to policies H9 (Student Housing) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017 and policy H15 (Purpose-built student accommodation) of the London Plan 2021.\n",
    "Reason : 18 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement securing 35% or the maximum viable proportion  of the student accommodation as affordable and available to students nominated by a specified education institution as needing affordable accommodation, would fail to provide a range of accommodation affordable to the student body as a whole  including those with state-funded living support  and recognised as in need of affordable accommodation, contrary to policy H9 (Student Housing) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017 and policy H15 (Purpose-built student accommodation) of the London Plan 2021.\n"
