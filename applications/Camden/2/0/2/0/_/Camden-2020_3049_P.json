    "Reason : 2 - The proposed bedsit would provide substandard residential accommodation by way of inadequate provision of sanitary facilities, which would be harmful to the amenities of future occupiers, contrary to policies H6 (Housing choice and mix) and policy H10 (Housing with shared facilities) of the Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n"
