    "Condition : 1 - The development hereby permitted must be begun not later than the end of three years from the date of this permission.\r\n\r\nReason: In order to comply with the provisions of Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended).\r\n\r\n",
    "Condition : 2 - The development hereby permitted shall be carried out in accordance with the following approved plans and documents: Site location plan; 1305.01D; 1305.03; 1305.04C; Aboricultural Method Statement dated 10 Feb 2012.\r\n\r\nReason:\r\nFor the avoidance of doubt and in the interest of proper planning.\r\n",
    "Condition : 3 - All new external work shall be carried out in materials that resemble, as closely as possible, in colour and texture those of the existing building, unless otherwise specified in the approved application. \r\n\r\nReason: To safeguard the appearance of the premises and the character of the immediate area in accordance with the requirements of policy D1 and D2 of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017, and DH1 and DH2 of the Hampstead Neighbourhood Plan 2018.\r\n\r\n",
    "Condition : 4 - No works shall commence until an update addendum to the Aboricultural Method Statement dated 10 Feb 2012, providing details of the current condition and size of the trees, is submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority, and until the measures of tree protection have been fully implemented in accordance with the statement and addendum.  The tree protection measures shall thereafter be retained and maintained for the duration of the demolition and construction period.\r\n\r\nReason: Development must not commence before this condition is discharged to ensure the retention of, and avoid irrevocable damage to, the retained trees which can provide an important visual amenity for the locality and the wider surrounding area in accordance with policy A3 of the Camden Local Plan 2017 and NE2 of the Hampstead Neighbourhood Plan 2018.\r\n"
