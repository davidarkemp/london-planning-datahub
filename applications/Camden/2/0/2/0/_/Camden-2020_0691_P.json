    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development  by reason of the scale and intensity of the use and its associated comings and goings on a 24 hour basis, would have a detrimental impact on the character and amenity of the  predominantly residential area in which it is located contrary to policies A1 (Amenity) and E3 (Tourism) of the Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement to secure the development as car- and coach-free, would be likely to contribute unacceptably to parking congestion in the surrounding area and cause disturbance to neighbouring residents, contrary to policies T1 (Prioritising walking, cycling and public transport), T2 (Parking and Car Parking), A1 (Managing the impact of development) and DM1 (Delivery and monitoring) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement to secure contributions towards, off site cycle parking would fail to promote sustainable transport options, contrary to policies T1 (Prioritising walking, cycling and public transport), T2 (Parking and Car Parking), A1 (Managing the impact of development) and DM1 (Delivery and monitoring) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n",
    "Reason : 4 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement securing a Delivery and Servicing Management Plan, would be likely to give rise to conflicts with other road users and be detrimental to the amenities of the area generally, contrary to policies G1 (Delivery and location of growth), A1 (Managing the impact of development), T3 (Transport Infrastructure), T4 (Sustainable movement of goods and materials), DM1 (Delivery and monitoring), A4 (Noise and Vibration) and CC4 (Air quality) of the Local Plan 2017.\r\n"
