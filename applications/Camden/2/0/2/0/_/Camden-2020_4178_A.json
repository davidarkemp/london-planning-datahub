    "Condition : 2 - No advertisement shall be sited or displayed so as to\r\n(a) endanger persons using any highway, railway, waterway, dock, harbour or aerodrome (civil or military);\r\n(b) obscure, or hinder the ready interpretation of any traffic sign, railway signal or aid to navigation by water or air; or\r\n(c) hinder the operation of any device used for the purpose of security or surveillance or for measuring the speed of any vehicle\r\n\r\nReason: - As required by regulation 2(1) and Schedule 2 of the Town & Country Planning (Control of Advertisements) (England) Regulations 2007.\r\n",
    "Condition : 3 - Any advertisement displayed and any site used for the display of advertisements, shall be maintained in a condition that does not impair the visual amenity of the site.\r\n\r\nReason: - As required by regulation 2(1) and Schedule 2 of the Town & Country Planning (Control of Advertisements) (England) Regulations 2007.\r\n",
