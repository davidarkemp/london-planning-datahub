  "description": "Erection of a three storey plus basement building comprising 7 flats (4 x 3-bed units and 3 x 2-bed units) with balconies at rear, following demolition of the existing house.",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development, by reason of the scale and bulk of its rear massing, would appear disproportionately large and out of keeping with the rear of the surrounding terraced properties, contrary to policy D1 (Design) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017 and policy 2 (Design & Character) of the  Fortune Green & West Hampstead Neighbourhood Plan. \r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed development, by reason of the provision of self-contained dwellings at basement level within the Sumatra Road Local Flood Risk Zone, would introduce highly vulnerable uses into an area prone to flooding contrary to policies A5 (Basements) and CC3 (Water and Flooding) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017. \r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement securing a Construction Management Plan, CMP implementation support contribution and Construction Impact Bond, would be likely to contribute unacceptably to traffic disruption, air pollution and be detrimental to general highway and pedestrian safety, contrary to policies A1 (Managing the impact of development), CC4 (Air Quality) and DM1 (Delivery and monitoring) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n",
    "Reason : 4 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement to secure car-free housing, would be likely to promote the use of non-sustainable modes of transport and contribute to air pollution and congestion in the surrounding area, contrary to policies T2 (Parking and car-free development) and DM1 (Delivery and monitoring) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017; and policy 7 (Sustainable Transport) of the Fortune Green & West Hampstead Neighbourhood Plan.  \r\n",
    "Reason : 5 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement securing a contribution to affordable housing, would fail to meet the needs of households unable to access market housing, contrary to policies H4 (Maximising the supply of affordable Housing) and DM1 (Delivery and monitoring) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017; and policy 1 (Housing) of the Fortune Green & West Hampstead Neighbourhood Plan.\r\n",
    "Reason : 6 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement securing a highway contribution for necessary highway works, would fail to secure adequate provision for the safe movement of pedestrians and have an unacceptable impact on the public highway, contrary to policies A1 (Managing the impact of development) and DM1 (Delivery and monitoring) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n",
    "Reason : 7 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement securing an Approval in Principle, would fail to ensure the structural stability of the public highway adjacent to the site, contrary to policies A1 (Managing the impact of development) and DM1 (Delivery and monitoring) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n"
