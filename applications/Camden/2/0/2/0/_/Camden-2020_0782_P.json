  "description": "Conversion of upper floors maisonette to create 3 flats (Class C3) consisting of 2 x 2bed 3person flats and 1x 3bed 4person flat; erection of enlarged rear extension at 1st floor; loft conversion involving a rear dormer roof extension, rear roof terrace and 3 front rooflights; erection of bin and bike stores in rear garden.",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed rear extension, roof extension and roof terrace privacy screen, by reason of their detailed design, height, size, bulk and siting, would harm the character and appearance of the host property, terraced group of properties and conservation area, contrary to policies D1 (design) and D2 (heritage) of the Camden Local Plan 2017 and policies 2 (Design and character) and 3 (Safeguarding and enhancing Conservation Areas and heritage assets) of the Fortune Green and West Hampstead Neighbourhood Plan  (2015).\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement for car-free housing, would be likely to contribute unacceptably to parking stress and congestion in the surrounding area and fail to promote more sustainable and efficient forms of transport, contrary to policies T1 (Prioritising walking, cycling and public transport), T2 (Parking and Car Parking) and A1 (Managing the impact of development) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement securing a Construction Management Plan and associated monitoring fee, would be likely to contribute unacceptably to traffic disruption and be detrimental to general highway and pedestrian safety, contrary to policies A1 (Managing the impact of development) and T4 (Sustainable movement of goods and materials) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n"
