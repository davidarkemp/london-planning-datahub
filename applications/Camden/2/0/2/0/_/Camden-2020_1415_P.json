  "description": "Erection of a second floor rear extension and roof extension, plus conversion of the first, second and third floors into 5 x 1 bedroom flats (Class C3)",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed rear and roof extensions, by reason of their location, size, bulk, height and design, would harm the character and appearance of the building and area, contrary to policy D1 (Design) of the Camden Local Plan 2017 and policy D3 (Design Principles) of the Kentish Town Neighbourhood Plan 2016.\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed 2nd floor extension, by reason of loss of outlook and privacy, would result in a loss of amenity to the occupiers of neighbouring properties.  contrary to policy A1 (Managing the impact of development) of the Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - In the absence of a Daylight Impact Assessment to demonstrate otherwise, it is considered likely that the proposed 2nd floor and roof extensions, by reason of loss of daylight and sunlight, would result in a loss of amenity to the occupiers of neighbouring properties, contrary to policy A1 (Managing the impact of development) of the Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n",
    "Reason : 4 - The proposed flats would not comply with the national described space standards and thus would fail to provide a satisfactory level of amenity for future occupiers, contrary to policy H6 (Housing choice and mix) of the Camden Local Plan 2017.  \r\n",
    "Reason : 5 - The proposed conversion, by reason of comprising all one bedroom market units, would fail to provide an appropriate mix of dwellings on the site, contrary to policy H7 (Large and small homes) of the Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n",
    "Reason : 6 - The proposal would not provide adequate waste and recycling arrangements for the new flats, contrary to policies A1 (Managing the impact of development) and CC5 (Waste) of the Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n",
    "Reason : 7 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement securing contributions to cycle parking facilities, would fail to secure adequate provision for cyclists, contrary to policy T1 (Prioritising walking, cycling and public transport) of the Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n",
    "Reason : 8 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement securing car-free housing, would be likely to contribute unacceptably to parking stress and congestion in the surrounding area and fail to promote more sustainable and efficient forms of transport, contrary to policy T2 (Parking and car-free development) of the Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n",
