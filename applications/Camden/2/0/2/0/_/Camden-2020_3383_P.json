  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed roof, side and rear extensions, by reason of their location, height, bulk and design, would be prominent additions which would be detrimental to the character and appearance of the host property and harmful to the uniformity of the adjoining terrace contrary to Policy D1 (Design) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017 and Policy D3 (Design principles) of the Kentish Town Neighbourhood Plan. ",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement securing a Construction Management Plan, implementation support contribution and Construction Impact Bond, would be likely to contribute unacceptably to traffic disruption and be detrimental to general highway and pedestrian safety, contrary to policies A1 (Managing the impact of development) and T4 (Sustainable movement of goods and materials) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement to secure car-free housing, would be likely to promote the use of non-sustainable modes of transport and contribute to air pollution and congestion in the surrounding area and, contrary to Policy T2 (Parking and car-free development) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017. \r\n"
