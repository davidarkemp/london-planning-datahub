    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development, by reason of its location, scale, bulk and detailed design would be an incongruous alteration which would be out of keeping with the existing architectural style of the building, and would cause unacceptable harm to the character and appearance of the host building, the building to the rear and surrounding area contrary to policy D1 (Design) of the Local Plan (2017), the London Plan (2021) and the NPPF (2021).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed development, by reason of its scale and siting would cause an unacceptable loss of outlook and sense of enclosure to the neighbouring residential properties to the rear contrary to policy A1 (Managing the impact of development) of the Local Plan (2017), the London Plan (2021) and the NPPF (2021).",
    "Reason : 3 - In the absence of an air quality assessment it has not been demonstrated that sufficient measures would be adopted to mitigate the impact of exposing future residents to high levels of air pollution contrary to policy CC4 (Air quality) of the Local Plan (2017), the London Plan (2021) and the NPPF (2021).",
    "Reason : 4 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement to secure a  Construction Management Plan, associated Implementation Support Contribution  and Bond would be likely to give rise to conflicts with other road users, and be detrimental to the amenities of the area generally, contrary to policies A1 (Managing the impact of growth and development), T1 (Prioritising walking, cycling, and public transport) of the Local Plan (2017), the London Plan (2021) and the NPPF (2021).\r\n",
    "Reason : 5 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement to secure a car- free development, would be likely to contribute unacceptably to parking stress and congestion in the surrounding area, contrary to policies T1 (Prioritising walking, cycling, and public transport) and T2 (Parking and car-free development) of the Local Plan (2017), the London Plan (2021) and the NPPF (2021).\r\n"
