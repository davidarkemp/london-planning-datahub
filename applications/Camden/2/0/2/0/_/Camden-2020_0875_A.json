    "Reason : 1 - The proposed advertisement, by virtue of its size, design, location and illumination, would result in an unduly dominant and incongruous fixture to the host property and streetscape, would create visual clutter, detrimental to the character and appearance of the host property and wider streetscene, and would be harmful to the setting and special interest of the nearby locally listed buildings (Nos 82 - 100 Cricklewood Broadway), contrary to policies D1, D2 and D4 of the Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed sign, by reason of its size, siting, manner (sequential display) and illumination would be likely to distract drivers and other road users, endangering pedestrian and highway safety, contrary to Policies A1, T1 and D4 of the Camden Local Plan 2017. "
