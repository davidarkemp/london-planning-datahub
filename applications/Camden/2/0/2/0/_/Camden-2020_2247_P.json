  "description": "Erection of a roof extension to provide 1 x 1 bedroom flat and 1 x 2 bedroom flat.",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed roof extension, by reason of its siting, scale, and design, would cause harm the symmetry, character and composition, and detract from the architectural significance of the host building, and harm the character and appearance of the Bloomsbury Conservation Area, contrary to policies D1 (Design) and D2 (Heritage) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan (2017).\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement securing an affordable housing contribution would fail to make adequate provision to the borough's strategic affordable housing targets, contrary to policy H4 (Maximising the Supply of Affordable Housing) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan (2017). \r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - In the absence of a legal agreement to prevent future occupiers from obtaining car parking permits the proposal would be unlikely to be a car-free development and it would promote increased car use in the Borough contrary to policies T2 (Parking and car-free development) and CC1 (Climate change mitigation) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan (2017).\r\n",
    "Reason : 4 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement to secure a construction management plan and an appropriate financial contribution towards implementation support and impact bond, would be likely to give rise to conflicts with other road users and be detrimental to the amenities of the area generally, contrary to policies G1 (Delivery and Location of Growth), A1 (Managing the Impact of Development), T3 (Transport Infrastructure), T4 (Sustainable Movement of Goods and Materials), DM1 (Delivery and Monitoring), A4 (Noise and Vibration) and CC4 (Air Quality) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan (2017).\r\n"
