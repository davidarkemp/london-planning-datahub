  "description": "Conversion of upper floors of 108 Kilburn High Road from solicitors office; erection of three storey rear extension with terrace above; mansard roof extensions across no's 108 and 110 and alterations to front elevation in association with provision of eight self-contained flats (use Class C3) accessed via Quex Mews.",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed three storey rear extension with terrace above, by reason of its height, width, location and design would fail to be a sensitive and contextual addition, to the detriment of the host building and neighbouring buildings contrary to policy D1 of the Camden Local Plan 2017.",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed development would fail to secure a range of homes of different sizes that will contribute to the creation of mixed, inclusive and sustainable communities, contrary to policy H7 of the Camden Local Plan 2017. ",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement to secure a contribution to cycle parking, would fail to promote cycling as a sustainable transport choice, contrary to policy T1 (Prioritising walking, cycling and public transport) of the Camden Local Plan 2017.  ",
    "Reason : 4 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement to secure car-free housing, would be likely to contribute unacceptably to parking stress and congestion in the surrounding area and fail to promote healthy or sustainable transport choices, contrary to policy T2 (Parking and car-free development) of the Camden Local Plan 2017.  ",
    "Reason : 5 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement to secure a contribution to affordable housing, would fail to maximise the contribution of the site to the supply of affordable housing in the borough, contrary to policy H4 (Maximising the supply of affordable housing) of the Camden Local Plan 2017.",
    "Reason : 6 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement to secure a  Construction Management Plan and associatedcontributions, would fail to ensure that the development can be implemented without causing detrimental  impact to residential amenity or the safe and efficient operation of the highway network in the local area, contrary to policies A1 and T4 of the Camden Local Plan 2017.
