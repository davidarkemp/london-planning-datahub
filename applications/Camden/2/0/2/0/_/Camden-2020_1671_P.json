  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed two storey roof extension, by reason of its height, form, location, materials and design, would be incongruous on the building and in the streetscene and would harm the overall pattern of development, to the detriment of the character and appearance of the host building and adjoining terrace of buildings, contrary to policy D1 (Design) of the Camden Local Plan 2017 and Policy 2 (Design and Character) of the Fortune Green and West Hampstead Neighbourhood Plan 2015.\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed four storey rear extension from basement level upwards, by reason of its height and design, would fail to be a subordinate addition to the host building and would disrupt the pattern of rear development on the terrace, to the detriment of the character and appearance of the host building, contrary to policy D1 (Design) of the Camden Local Plan 2017 and Policy 2 (Design and Character) of the Fortune Green and West Hampstead Neighbourhood Plan 2015.\r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed external terraces, by reason of their proximity to neighbouring habitable windows, would result in overlooking to neighbouring windows, to the detriment of their residential amenities, contrary to policy A1 (Managing the Impact of Development) of the Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n",
    "Reason : 4 - The proposed rear extensions, by reason of their height, location and proximity to neighbouring habitable windows, would result in an unacceptable loss of outlook and increased sense of enclosure to neighbouring windows, contrary to policy A1 (Managing the Impact of Development) of the Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n",
    "Reason : 5 - The proposed basement level flats, by reason of their inadequate levels of outlook, daylight and sunlight, ventilation and low ceiling height, would result in a sub-standard quality of living accommodation for the prospective occupiers, contrary to policies D1 (Design) of the Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n",
    "Reason : 6 - In the absence of a Basement Impact Assessment to demonstrate otherwise, it is likely that the proposed basement development would cause harm to the structural stability of the building and neighbouring properties and would adversely affect the structural, ground and water conditions of the area, contrary to policy A5 (Basements) of Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n",
    "Reason : 7 - The siting, location and design of the proposed basement, by reason of its double height and location below an existing basement, would fail to be subordinate to the host building, contrary to policies D1 (Design), A5 (Basements) of the Camden Local Plan 2017 and Policy 2 (Design and Character) of the Fortune Green and West Hampstead Neighbourhood Plan 2015.\r\n",
    "Reason : 8 - The proposed front lightwells, by reason of their location, design and size, would fail to appear subordinate to the building or respect the original design and proportions of the building and wider terrace, to the detriment of the character and appearance of the host building and streetscene, contrary to policies D1 (Design) and A5 (Basements) of the Camden Local Plan 2017 and Policy 2 (Design and Character) of the Fortune Green and West Hampstead Neighbourhood Plan 2015.\r\n",
    "Reason : 9 - The proposed development, by reason of the failure to provide the required long-stay and short-stay cycle spaces, would fail to promote sustainable transport use, contrary to policy T1 (Prioritising walking, cycling and public transport) of the Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n",
    "Reason : 10 - The proposed development would fail to demonstrate compliance with the carbon reduction targets of Part L1B of Building Regulations for retained thermal through the application of the energy hierarchy, and would therefore fail to ensure proper standards of sustainability in the development, contrary to policy CC1 (Climate change mitigation) of the Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n",
    "Reason : 11 - In the absence of detailed measures to mitigate surface water run-off, the development would fail to be resilient to climate change and would contribute to the risk of flooding, contrary to policies CC2 (Adapting to climate change) and CC3 (Water and flooding) of the Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n",
    "Reason : 12 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement securing a Construction Management Plan (CMP) and associated contributions to support the implementation of the CMP, would be likely to give rise to conflicts with other road users and be detrimental to the amenities of the area generally, contrary to policies A1 (Managing the impact of development), T4 (Sustainable movement of goods and materials) and DM1 (Delivery and monitoring) of the Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n",
    "Reason : 13 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement securing an affordable housing contribution, would fail to maximise the supply of affordable to meet the needs of households unable to access market housing, contrary to policy H4 (Maximising the supply of affordable housing) of the Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n",
    "Reason : 14 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement securing car-free housing, would be likely to contribute unacceptably to parking stress and congestion in the surrounding area and fail to promote more sustainable and efficient forms of transport and active lifestyles, contrary to policies T2 (Parking and car-free development) and DM1 (Delivery and monitoring) of the Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n",
    "Reason : 15 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement securing necessary highway works, would fail to secure adequate provision for and safety of pedestrians, cyclists and vehicles, contrary to policies A1 (Managing the impact of development), T1 (Prioritising walking, cycling and public transport) and DM1 (Delivery and monitoring) of the Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n",
    "Reason : 16 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement securing an Approval in Principle, would fail to mitigate the impact of the basement works on the adjacent public highway, contrary to policies A1 (Managing the impact of development), T3 (Transport Infrastructure) and DM1 (Delivery and monitoring) of the Camden Local Plan 2017. \r\n"
