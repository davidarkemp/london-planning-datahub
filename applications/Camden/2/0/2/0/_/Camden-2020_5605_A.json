  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed hanging sign, by reason of its large size, location at first floor level and illumination would be overly prominent and detrimental to the architectural and historic character of the locally listed building, harmful to the appearance of the streetscene and harmful to the residential amenity of occupiers of the building.  It would therefore be contrary to policy D4 (Advertisements) of the Camden Local Plan 2017 and policy D3 (Design Principles) of the Kentish Town Neighbourhood Plan 2016\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed fascia signs and logo, and neon lettering above the door, by reason of their internal illumination, would be harmful to the architectural and historic character of the locally listed building and the visual amenity of the streetscene  They would therefore be contrary to policy D4 (Advertisements) of the Camden Local Plan 2017 and policy D3 (Design Principles) of the Kentish Town Neighbourhood Plan 2016.\r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed chalkboards and A-board, due to their siting on the pavement, would be prejudicial to highway safety and result in unnecessary street clutter and harm to visual amenity, contrary to policy D4 (Advertisements) of the Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n"
