    "Reason : 1 - The proposed roof extension, by reason of its form and materials, would result in an inappropriate and prominent addition to the local roofscape which would harm the character and appearance of the building, the streetscene and the Bloomsbury Conservation Area. It would therefore be contrary to policies D1 and D2 of the Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement to secure a \r\nconstruction management plan, construction impact bond and a financial \r\ncontribution for construction management plan monitoring, would be likely to give rise to conflicts with other road users and be detrimental to the amenities of the area generally, contrary to policies G1 (Delivery and location of growth), A1 (Managing the impact of development), T3 (Transport Infrastructure), T4 (Sustainable movement of goods and materials), DM1 (Delivery and monitoring), A4 (Noise and Vibration) and CC4 (Air quality) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n"
