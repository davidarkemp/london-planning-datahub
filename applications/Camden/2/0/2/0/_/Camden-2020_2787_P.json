    "Reason : 1 - The proposed roof extension by reason of its bulk, design and siting on a largely unaltered roofscape, would represent an overly dominant and incongruous addition to the area, causing harm to the character and appearance of the host property, adjoining terrace and surrounding area, contrary to policy D1 (Design) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan (2017).\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The access to the proposed second floor duplex, by reason of its shared core with the first floor commercial floorspace, would provide a poor quality of accommodation for future occupants, contrary to policies A1 (Managing the Impact of Development), C5 (Safety and Security), and H6 (Housing Choice and Mix) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan (2017).\r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement securing car-free housing, would be likely to contribute unacceptably to parking stress and congestion in the surrounding area, contrary to policy T2 (Parking and Car Free Development) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan (2017).\r\n",
    "Reason : 4 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement securing a contribution towards cycle storage, would fail to promote sustainable methods of transport, contrary to policy T1 (Prioritising Walking, Cycling and Public Transport) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan (2017).\r\n",
    "Reason : 5 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement to secure a construction management plan and an appropriate financial contribution towards implementation support and construction impact bond, would be likely to give rise to conflicts with other road users and be detrimental to the amenities of the area generally, contrary to policies G1 (Delivery and Location of Growth), A1 (Managing the Impact of Development), T3 (Transport Infrastructure), T4 (Sustainable Movement of Goods and Materials), DM1 (Delivery and Monitoring), A4 (Noise and Vibration) and CC4 (Air Quality) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan (2017).\r\n"
