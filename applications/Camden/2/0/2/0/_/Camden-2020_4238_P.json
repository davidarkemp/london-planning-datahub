    "Reason : 2 - In the absence of dynamic thermal modelling to demonstrate the need for active cooling equipment, the Council cannot be satisfied that the proposed works are necessary and that appropriate climate adaptation measures to reduce the impact of urban and dwelling overheating could not be achieved by other preferred measures as set out in the cooling hierarchy. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy CC2 (Climate change adaptation measures) of the Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n"
