    "Reason : 2 - The proposed monopole and cabinets, by virtue of their size and location, would create unnecessary street clutter, would reduce the amount of useable footway, would cause harm to highway safety and would hinder pedestrian movement, contrary to policies A1 (Managing the impact of development), C6 (Access for all) and T1 (Prioritising walking, cycling and public transport) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n"
