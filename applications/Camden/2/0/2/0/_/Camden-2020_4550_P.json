    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development, on account of its position in close proximity to residential dwellings and other food, drink and entertainment uses in the vicinity, would result in an overconcentration of food, drink and entertainment uses which would result in noise, disturbance, late night comings and goings, cooking smells, litter and food debri in the area, which would cause unacceptable harm to the local residential amenity, contrary to policies A1 (Managing the impact of development), A4 (Noise and vibration), TC2 (Camden's centres and other shopping areas), and TC4 (Town centre uses) of London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed extract flue, due to its scale, position, projection, form and materials, would represent an incongruous addition which would cause harm to the character and appearance of the host building and wider Covent Garden Conservation area, contrary to policies D1 (Design) and D2 (Heritage) of Camden Local Plan 2017. \r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - The applicant has failed to demonstrate that the extraction equipment, when operating at full capacity, would be capable of doing so without causing noise disturbance and harm to the local residential environment, contrary to policies A1 (Managing the impact of development), A4 (Noise and vibration), TC2 (Camden's centres and other shopping areas) and TC4 (Town centre uses) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.",
    "Reason : 4 - The proposal would result in an additional hot food takeaway unit (Use class Sui-Generis) located in close proximity to a school that would have a harmful impact on public health, contrary to policy TC4 (Town centre uses) of the Camden Local Plan 2017, and policy E9 (Retail, markets and hot food takeaways) of the London Plan (2021) and relevant planning guidance.
