    "Reason : 1 - The development, by reason of its height, bulk, mass and detailed design, would be detrimental to the appearance of the host property, the streetscape and the Camden Town conservation area contrary to policies D1 (Design) and D2 (Heritage) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017. \r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - In the absence of an overshadowing assessment, the applicant has failed to demonstrate that the open space to the rear would receive sufficient sunlight, contrary to policy A1 (Managing the impact of development) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017. \r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - In the absence of a detailed air quality assessment, the applicant has failed to demonstrate that future occupiers of the proposed flats would not be exposed to poor air quality, contrary to policy CC4 (Air quality) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017. \r\n",
    "Reason : 4 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement securing a Construction Management Plan, CMP implementation support contribution and Construction Impact Bond, would be likely to contribute unacceptably to traffic disruption, air pollution and be detrimental to general highway and pedestrian safety, contrary to Policies A1 (Managing the impact of development), CC4 (Air Quality) and DM1 (Delivery and monitoring) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n",
    "Reason : 5 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement to secure car-free housing, would be likely to promote the use of non-sustainable modes of transport and contribute to air pollution and congestion in the surrounding area and, contrary to Policies T2 (Parking and car-free development) and DM1 (Delivery and monitoring) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n",
    "Reason : 6 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement securing a contribution to affordable housing, would fail to meet the needs of households unable to access market housing, contrary to Policies H4 (Maximising the supply of affordable Housing) and DM1 (Delivery and monitoring) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n"
