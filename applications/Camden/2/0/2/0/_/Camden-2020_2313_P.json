  "description": "Change of use from office (Class A2) to residential (Class C3) to create a one bedroom unit; erection of a single storey ground floor rear extension; creation of a first floor roof terrace including raising front and rear parapet walls; alterations to street frontage including erection of metal railings, provision of a refuse store and two cycle parking space within front garden; plus various alterations to elevations and fenestration",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed dwelling, by reason of its total size and the size of the bedroom/sitting room, would fail to meet the nationally described space standards and it would therefore fail to provide a satisfactory quality of residential accommodation for future occupiers.  The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy H6 (Housing choice and mix) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed elevational alterations and frontage treatment including the raised wall, new entrance, new window, railings, and bicycle and bin stores, by reason of their location, form and design, would be harmful to the character and appearance of the host building, streetscene and Camden Town Conservation Area.  The proposal is therefore contrary to policies D1 (Design) and D2 (Heritage) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed rear extension and residential garden, by way of their size, siting and proximity to the rear windows/courtyard at the rear of 25 Mornington Crescent, would result in a loss of privacy, increased noise and disturbance, loss of outlook and likely loss of daylight (in the absence of demonstration otherwise by a Daylight/Sunlight Assessment) to occupiers in 25 Mornington Crescent. The proposal is therefore contrary to policy A1 (Managing the impact of development) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n",
    "Reason : 4 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement securing car-free housing, would be likely to contribute unacceptably to parking stress and congestion in the surrounding area and fail to promote more sustainable and efficient forms of transport. This would be contrary to policies T2 (Parking and car-free development) and CC1 (Climate change mitigation) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n\r\n"
