  "description": "Erection of two storey extension; change of use of first floor and part of ground floor from barbers (Class E) to residential (Class C3); and alterations to shopfront including installation of residential access door in association with provision of 3-bed residential unit (Class C3)",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed two storey extension, by reason of its height, location and prominence would harm the pattern of historic development to the detriment of the character and appearance of the host building, neighbouring buildings and the Camden Broadway Conservation Area contrary to policies D1 (Design) and D2 (Heritage) of the Camden Local Plan 2017. \r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement to secure car-free housing, would be likely to contribute unacceptably to parking stress and congestion in the surrounding area and fail to promote more healthy or sustainable transport choices, contrary to policy T2 (Parking and car-free development) of the Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement to secure a contribution to affordable housing, would fail to maximise the contribution of the site to the supply of affordable housing in the borough, contrary to policy H4 (Maximising the supply of affordable housing) of the Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n",
    "Reason : 4 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement to secure a Construction Management Plan (and associated support contribution and bond) would fail to ensure that the development can be implemented without causing detrimental impact to residential amenity or the safe and efficient operation of the highway network in the local area, contrary to policies A1 (Managing the impact of development) and T4 (Sustainable movement of goods and Materials) of the Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n"
