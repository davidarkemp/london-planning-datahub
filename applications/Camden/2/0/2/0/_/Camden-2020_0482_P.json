    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development, by reason of its siting, scale, and design, represents undue harm to the character, appearance and architectural integrity of the property, and fails to preserve or enhance the character and appearance of the Seven Dials (Covent Garden) Conservation Area. As such the proposal is contrary to policies D1 (Design) and D2 (Heritage) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan (2017), the London Plan (2016), and the NPPF (2019).\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed access doors and balcony, by reason of their number, scale, design, prominent location and distance to neighboring occupiers, would likely result in unduly harmful levels of noise and disturbance to nearby residential properties. As such the proposal is contrary to policies A1 (Managing the impact of development) and A4 (Noise and Vibration) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan (2017), the London Plan (2016), and the NPPF (2019). \r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement to secure a construction management plan and an appropriate financial contribution towards implementation support, would be likely to give rise to conflicts with other road users and be detrimental to the amenities of the area generally, contrary to policies G1 (Delivery and Location of Growth), A1 (Managing the Impact of Development), T3 (Transport Infrastructure), T4 (Sustainable Movement of Goods and Materials), DM1 (Delivery and Monitoring), and A4 (Noise and Vibration) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan (2017), the London Plan (2016), and the NPPF (2019).\r\n",
