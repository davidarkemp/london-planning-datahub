  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The principle of development is not supported as the applicant has failed to demonstrate that that suitable marketing has been undertaken for the mezzanine commercial space to demonstrate that there is no viable or desired use for this space, which would result in a loss in employment space which is vital to maintaining and developing Camden's successful economy, contrary to policy E2 (Employment premises and sites) of the Camden Local Plan 2017. ",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed development, by reason of the under-sized units, poorly apportioned and inefficient layout of the units, lack of external amenity space, privacy impacts on the occupants of Units C and D, and failure to demonstrate that all habitable rooms would receive adequate levels of daylight, would provide unacceptable and substandard living accommodation for future occupiers of the development, contrary to policies H6 (Housing choice and mix) and D1 (Design) of the Camden Local Pan 2017, D6 (Housing quality and standards) of the London Plan 2021, and Principle 9 (Residential amenity) of the Fitzrovia Area Action Plan 2014.  ",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed development, in the absence of an Air Quality Assessment, has failed to demonstrate that future occupants would not be exposed to unacceptable levels of air pollution and subsequently that the site is suitable for residential use, contrary to Policy CC4 (Air quality) of the Camden Local Plan.",
    "Reason : 4 - The proposed development, by reason of failure to provide secure, convenient and accessible cycle parking for Unit D, would fail to promote sustainable and active transport modes contrary to Policy T1 (Prioritising walking, cycling and public transport) of the Camden Local Plan 2017.",
    "Reason : 5 - In the absence of a legal agreement securing an affordable housing contribution, the development would fail to maximise the supply of affordable housing to meet the needs of households unable to access market housing, contrary to policy H4 (Affordable housing) of the Camden Local Plan 2017 and Principle 1 (Housing and affordable housing) of the Fitzrovia Area Action Plan 2014.  ",
    "Reason : 6 - In the absence of a legal agreement securing the development as car-free, the development would contribute to parking stress, congestion in the surrounding area, environmental impacts, and fail to promote more sustainable and efficient forms of transport and active lifestyles, contrary to policies T1 (Prioritising walking, cycling and public transport), T2 (Parking and car-free development) and DM1 (Delivery and monitoring) of the Camden Local Plan 2017."
