  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - Reason for Refusal:\r\n\r\nThe steel frame and envelope, by virtue of its size, scale, design, location and materials would be an incongruous and overly dominant feature that would harm the surrounding area, detracting from the clutter free and open aspect from Euston Circus. These elements of the proposal are considered to be an unsympathetic and unacceptable form of development that would be detrimental to the character and appearance of the streetscape and surrounding area, contrary to policy D1 (Design) of the Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - Reason for Refusal\r\n\r\nThe steel frame and  envelope, by virtue of its size, scale, design and location, would be detrimental to the free movement of pedestrians,  cyclists and the visually impaired, contrary to policy T1 (Prioritising walking, cycling and public transport) of the Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n"
