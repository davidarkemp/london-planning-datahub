    "Reason : 1 - The proposed extension and plant enclosure, by way of their scale, bulk, location,  materials and elevational design, would appear as an unduly dominant and visually intrusive addition detracting  from the character and appearance of the host building, adjacent mews and the surrounding part of the  Belsize Conservation Area contrary to policies D1 (Design) and D2 (Heritage) of the Camden Local Plan 2017 and the Belsize Conservation Statement 2002.\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed plant enclosure, in the absence of acoustic information demonstrating that the enclosed plant is capable of operating within acceptable noise limits, is considered likely to result in increased disturbance for the occupiers of neighbouring dwellings contrary to policy A1 (Managing the impact of development) of the LB Camden Local Plan 2017 and the Camden Planning Guidance on Design (2019).",
