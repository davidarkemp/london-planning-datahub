    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development would result in the loss of residential floorspace and would undermine the Council's strategic objective to maintain and increase the supply of housing in the Borough. This is contrary to policy H3 (Protecting Existing Homes) of the Camden Local Plan 2017.",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement for car-free development, would be likely to contribute unacceptably to parking stress and congestion in the surrounding area, contrary to policies T1 (Prioritising walking, cycling and public transport), T2 (Parking and Car Parking), A1 (Managing the impact of development) and DM1 (Delivery and monitoring) of the Camden Local Plan 2017.",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposal, due to the absence of cycle parking facilities provided onsite, would fail to encourage cycling as a sustainable and efficient mode of transport, contrary to policy T1 (Prioritising walking, cycling and public transport) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017."
