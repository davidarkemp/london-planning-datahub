",
    "Reason : 2 - The creation of an on-site garage, which provides up to two parking spaces would promote the use of private motor vehicles and fail to encourage the use of sustainable modes of transport, contrary to policies T1 (Prioritising walking, cycling and public transport), T2 (Parking and car free development) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n\r\n"
