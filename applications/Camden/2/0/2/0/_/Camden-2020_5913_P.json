    "Reason : 1 - The proposed distribution use, by reason of its size and location, would increase pressure on the local road network, increase vehicle dominance and road danger to the detriment of pedestrian safety and would discourage walking and cycling contrary to Policies A1 (Managing the impact of development) and T1 (Prioritising walking, cycling and public transport) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017; and Policies E4 (Land for industry, logistics and services to support London's economic function) and T4 (Assessing and mitigating transport impacts) of the London Plan 2021. \r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed distribution use, by reason of its size, location and hours of operation, would result in noise and disturbance that would harm residential amenity contrary to Policies A1 (Managing the impact of development) and A4 (Noise and vibration) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017. \r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed development, in the absence of an appropriately detailed air quality assessment which assesses the potential impact on the local area and which demonstrates that the development would be at least air quality neutral, would not support the Kentish Town Planning Framework's objective of improving air quality and would be contrary to policies A1 (Managing the impact of development) and CC4 (Air Quality) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017; and Policy SI 1 (Improving air quality) of the London Plan 2021.\r\n",
    "Reason : 4 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement securing a Construction Management Plan, CMP implementation support contribution and Construction Impact Bond, would be likely to contribute unacceptably to traffic disruption, air pollution and be detrimental to general highway and pedestrian safety, contrary to policies A1 (Managing the impact of development), CC4 (Air Quality) and DM1 (Delivery and monitoring) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n",
    "Reason : 5 - The proposed change of use, in the absence of a legal agreement to secure a car-free development, would be likely to promote the use of non-sustainable modes of transport and contribute to air pollution and congestion in the surrounding area, contrary to policy T2 (Parking and car-free development) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.  \r\n  ",
