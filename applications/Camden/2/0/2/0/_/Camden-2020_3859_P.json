  "description": "Erection of mansard roof extension with front roof terrace and conversion of upper floors into a 1-bedroom flat and a 3-bedroom maisonette plus alterations to windows at rear ground floor and side 1st floor",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed mansard roof extension, by reason of its location, bulk and design, would appear as a visually obtrusive and incongruous addition on the property and would disrupt an unaltered roofscape of this row of terraced properties. It would thus harm the character and appearance of the host building, terrace of which it forms part, streetscene and conservation area. This is contrary to policies D1 (Design) and D2 (Heritage) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017 and policies 2 (Design and character) and 3 (Safeguarding and enhancing Conservation Areas and heritage assets) of the Fortune Green and West Hampstead Neighbourhood Plan 2015.\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - In the absence of a S106 legal agreement securing car-free housing, the proposed conversion would be likely to contribute unacceptably to parking stress and congestion in the surrounding area and fail to promote more sustainable and efficient forms of transport. This is contrary to policies T1 (Prioritising walking, cycling and public transport) and T2 (Parking and car-free development) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017. \r\n"
