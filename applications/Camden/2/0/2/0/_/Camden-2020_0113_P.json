    "Condition : 2 - The development hereby permitted shall be carried out in accordance with the following approved drawings:\r\n\r\nLP-00 Location and Site Plan; SP-00 Existing and Proposed Site Plan; \r\n18107 Tree protection plan Dec 2019; Tree protection during building of rear extension by Tretec December 2019;\r\n\r\nExisting drawings: EX-01 Ground Floor Plan Rev P-00; EX-02 First & Second Floor Plan Rev P-00; EX-03 Third Floor & Roof Plan Rev P-00; EX-04 Front & Rear Elevation Rev P-01; EX-05 Side Elevations Rev P-00; EX-06 Section AA Rev P-00; \r\n\r\nProposed drawings: PA-01 Ground Floor Plan Rev P-01; PA-02 First & Second Floor Plan Rev P-01; PA-03 Third Floor & Roof Plan Rev P-00; PA-04 Front & Rear Elevation Rev P-01; PA-05 Side Elevations Rev P-00; PA-06 Section AA Rev P-00;\r\n\r\nReason: For the avoidance of doubt and in the interest of proper planning.\r\n",
    "Condition : 3 - Prior to commencement of the rear extension, full details in respect of the two areas of living roof shall be submitted to and approved by the local planning authority. The details shall include \r\ni.  a detailed scheme of maintenance;\r\nii.  sections at a scale of 1:20 with manufacturers details demonstrating the construction and materials used; and \r\niii.  full details of planting species and density.\r\n\r\nThe living roofs shall be fully provided in accordance with the approved details prior to first occupation and thereafter retained and maintained in accordance with the approved scheme. \r\n\r\nReason: In order to ensure the development undertakes reasonable measures to take account of biodiversity and the water environment in accordance with policies CC1, CC2, CC3, D1, D2 and A3 of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n",
    "Condition : 4 - Prior to the commencement of any works on site, a site-visit based arboricultural survey shall be carried out by a suitably qualified and experienced arboriculturalist engaged by the developer to confirm whether the details of the trees are consistent with the document '18107 Tree protection plan Dec 2019' and remain a valid basis for the recommendations of the document 'Tree protection during building of rear extension by Tretec December 2019'. Where the survey evidence is consistent and the tree protection recommendations unchanged, tree protection measures shall be put in place in accordance with the documents prior to the commencement of any works on site. \r\n\r\nWhere the survey evidence differs and/or the tree protection recommendations change, an updated survey and tree protection statement demonstrating how trees to be retained shall be protected during construction work and a method statement for carrying out the works shall be submitted to and approved by the local planning authority in writing, prior to the commencement of any works on site. Such details shall follow guidelines and standards set out in  BS5837:2012 \"Trees in relation to design, demolition and construction\". All measures thereby approved shall be put in place prior to commencement of any works. \r\n\r\nAll trees on the site, or parts of trees growing from adjoining sites, unless shown on the permitted drawings as being removed, shall be retained and protected from damage in accordance with the approved protection details.  \r\n \r\nReason: To ensure that the development will not have an adverse effect on existing trees and in order to maintain the character and amenity of the area in accordance with the requirements of policies A2 and A3 of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017 and policies BG1 and BG2 of the Redington Frognal Neighbourhood Plan (submission version).\r\n",
    "Condition : 5 - Prior to the end of the next available planting season after the completion of the rear extension, a Wild Service heavy standard (12-14cm) shall be planted to replace the removal of the cherry and shall be irrigated and maintained to allow it to establish. \r\n\r\nIf, within a period of 5 years from the completion of the development, the tree dies, is removed or becomes seriously damaged or diseased, it shall be replaced as soon as is reasonably possible and, in any case, by not later than the end of the following planting season, with another of similar size and species.\r\n\r\nReason: To ensure that the development maintains a high quality of tree coverage which contributes to the visual amenity and character of the area, in accordance with the requirements of policies A2, A3, D1 and D2 of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017. \r\n",
    "Condition : 6 - Before the relevant part of the work is begun, detailed drawings, or samples of materials as appropriate, in respect of the following, shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority: \r\n\r\na) Manufacturers' details and drawings including sections at 1:10 of the glazing to the rear extension; \r\n\r\nb) Manufacturers' sample details of the metal cladding to the rear extension ; \r\n\r\nc) Manufacturers' details of any replacement paving to the front garden, including details of its permeability to support reduction of rainwater runoff; \r\n\r\nd) A sample panel of the facing brickwork demonstrating the proposed colour, texture, face-bond and pointing shall be provided on site.\r\n\r\nThe relevant part of the works shall be carried out in accordance with the details thus approved and all approved samples shall be retained on site during the course of the works. \r\n\r\nReason:  To safeguard the appearance of the premises and the character of the immediate area in accordance with the requirements of policy D1 and D2 of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n"
