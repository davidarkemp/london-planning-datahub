    "Condition : 1 - The development hereby permitted must be begun not later than the end of three years from the date of this permission.\r\n\r\nReason: In order to comply with the provisions of Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended).\r\n\r\n",
    "Condition : 2 - All new external work shall be carried out in materials that resemble, as closely as possible, in colour and texture those of the existing building, unless otherwise specified in the approved application. \r\n\r\nReason: To safeguard the appearance of the premises and the character of the immediate area in accordance with the requirements of policy D1 and D2 of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017. \r\n",
    "Condition : 3 - The development hereby permitted shall be carried out in accordance with the following approved plans 1923 LP01, 1923 PL01 Rev A, 1923 PL02, 1923 PL03, 1923 PL04 Rev A, 1923 PL05, 1923 PL06 Rev A, 1923 PL07\r\n\r\nReason: For the avoidance of doubt and in the interest of proper planning.\r\n",
    "Condition : 4 - The roof of the extension hereby approved shall not be used as a roof terrace or other form of amenity space. No alterations shall be carried out; nor planters or other chattels placed on the roof. No railings or other means of enclosure shall be erected on the roof, and no alterations shall be carried out to any elevation of the application property to form access onto the roof.\r\n\r\nReason: The use of the roof as a terrace would increase the likelihood of harm to the existing residential amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties as a result of noise and disturbance and loss of privacy contrary to policy A1 of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n"
