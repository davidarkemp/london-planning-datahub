    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development by virtue of its position, bulk and detailed design, would appear as an incongruous development that would have an adverse impact on the character and appearance of the host and neighbouring buildings and surrounding Camden Square Conservation Area, contrary to policies D1 (Design) and D2 (Heritage) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.  ",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed development, by reason of the inadequate level of outlook provided for future occupants of the dwelling would result in a poor standard of accommodation, contrary to policies A1 (Managing the impact of development), D1 (Design) and H7 (Large and small homes) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed development, in the absence of any cycling parking provision, would fail to promote sustainable transport in the borough, contrary to policy T1 (Prioritising walking, cycling and public transport) of London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.",
    "Reason : 4 - The proposed development, by reason of the removal of an existing mature tree on site and absence of any information relating to the protection of trees on site and at neighbouring gardens, would impact upon the visual amenity and character of Camden Square Conservation Area, contrary to policies A2 (Open Space), A3 (Biodiversity), D1 (Design), D2 (Heritage) of London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.",
    "Reason : 5 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement for car-free housing, would be likely to contribute unacceptably to parking stress and congestion in the surrounding area, contrary to policy T2 (Parking and car-free development) of London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n",
    "Reason : 6 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement securing a construction management plan, would be likely to give rise to conflicts with other road users, and be detrimental to the amenities of the area generally, contrary to policies A1(Managing the impact of development), T3 (Transport Infrastructure), T4 (Sustainable movement of goods and materials) of London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.",
    "Reason : 7 - The proposed development in the absence of additional information to demonstrate the new dwellings' performance against carbon reduction targets towards net-zero, and reduction of surface water run-off, would be likely to increase the carbon emissions in the borough and surface water run-off, contrary to policies CC1 (Climate change mitigation) and CC2 (Climate change adaptation) of London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017."
