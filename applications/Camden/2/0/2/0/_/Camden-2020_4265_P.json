  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposal would result in the loss of a front garden landscaped space and a front boundary wall, which contribute to the character and appearance of the area, and as such would be harmful to the character and appearance of the streetscene and Inkerman Conservation Area. This is contrary to policies D1 (Design) and D2 (Heritage) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017 and policies D3 (Design Principles) and GO3 (Biodiverse Habitats) of the Kentish Town Neighbourhood Plan 2016.\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - In the absence of detailed measures to mitigate the loss of permeable green space, the development fails to demonstrate that it would be resilient to climate change and would not contribute to the risk of flooding. This is contrary to policies CC2 (Adapting to climate change) and CC3 (Water and flooding) of the Local Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n",
