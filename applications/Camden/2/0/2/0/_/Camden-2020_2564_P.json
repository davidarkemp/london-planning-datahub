    "Reason : 1 - The proposed iron railing, projecting sliding rooflight and glass balustrade by reason of their siting, scale, detailed design and prominence, would add visual clutter detrimental to the host building, would fail to either preserve or enhance the character and appearance of the Fitzroy Square Conservation Area and detract from the setting of the adjacent grade II and grade II* listed housings within Mews and to the rear on Fitzroy Square. Thus, the proposal is contrary to policies D1 (Design) and D2 (Heritage) of the Local Plan 2017.",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed roof terrace, by reason of its siting, scale, design and proximity to neighbouring properties, would result in overlooking, loss of privacy and noise disturbance to neighbiuring properties, contrary to policy A1 (Managing the Impact of Development) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan (2017)."
