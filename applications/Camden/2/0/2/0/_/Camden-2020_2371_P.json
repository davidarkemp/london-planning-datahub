  "description": "Installation of external air conditioning condenser unit to the side elevation at first floor level.",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed external condenser unit, by virtue of its size, design, location and visbility would result in harm to the special architectural and historic interest of the Grade ll Listed Building, the character and appearance of the street scene and wider Hampstead Conservation Area, contrary to Policy D1 (Design) and D2 (Heritage) of the Camden Local Plan 2017 and Policy DH1 and DH2 of the Hampstead Neighbourhood Plan 2018.\r\n\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - In the absence of dynamic thermal modelling to demonstrate the need for active cooling equipment, the Council cannot be satisfied that the proposed works are necessary and that appropriate climate adaptation measures to reduce the impact of urban and dwelling overheating, could not be achieved by other preferred measures as set out in the cooling hierarchy. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy CC2 (Climate change adaptation measures) of the Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n"
