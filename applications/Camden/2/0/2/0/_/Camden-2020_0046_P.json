  "description": "Erection glazed link extensions, new lift shaft including the increase in height of existing flue/ventilation duct all associated with the additional student accommodation (sui-generis) at roof level.\r\n",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development, by virtue of its height, mass, scale and detailed design, would be detrimental to the character and appearance of the host building, streetscene and wider area while failing to either preserve or enhance the character and appearance of the adjacent Harmood Street Conservation Area, contrary to policies D1 (Design) and D2 (Heritage) of the Camden Local Plan 2017.",
    "Reason : 2 - Insufficient information has been submitted in demonstrate that the proposed roof extension would not cause harm to the amenity of the occupiers of existing adjacent residential dwellings along Hartland Road in terms of a loss of daylight to habitable rooms, contrary to policy A1 (managing the impact of development) of the Local Plan 2017. ",
    "Reason : 3 - Insufficient details have been submitted to demonstrate that the proposal would be sustainable development. As such, the scheme  would fail to be sustainable in its use of resources, contrary to policies CC1 (Climate change mitigation), CC2 (Adapting to climate change), CC3 (Water and flooding) and DM1 (Delivery and monitoring) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n",
    "Reason : 4 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement to secure a car-free development, would be likely to contribute unacceptably to parking stress and congestion in the surrounding area, contrary to policies T1 (Prioritising walking, cycling and public transport), T2 (Parking and car-free development) and DM1 (Delivery and monitoring) of Camden Local Plan 2017.",
    "Reason : 5 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement securing a student management plan, would fail to protect the amenities of the surrounding area contrary to policies A1 (Managing the impact of development) and DM1 (Delivery and monitoring) of Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n",
    "Reason : 6 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement for defining that the occupation of the student units would be restricted to students in full or part time higher education at specific education institutions and no part of the property to be sold as a separate self-contained unit, would fail to supply appropriate student housing and lead to accommodation that would be inappropriate for private use, contrary to policies H9 (Student Housing) and D1 (Design) of Camden Local Plan 2017."
