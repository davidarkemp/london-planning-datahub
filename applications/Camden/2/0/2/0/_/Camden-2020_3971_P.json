    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development by reason of its size, position and detailed design would appear as an incongruous development that would have an adverse impact on the character and appearance of the host building, its garden setting and this part of the South Hill Park Conservation Area, as well as resulting in a loss of openness to the Hampstead Heath - Metropolitan Open Land, contrary to policies A2 (Open Space),  D1 (Design), D2 (Heritage) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017 and DH1 (Design), DH2 (Conservation area and listed buildings) of Hampstead Neighbourhood Plan 2033.\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed development, by reason of its proximity to mature trees on the open spaces next to Hampstead Heath and location within a Biodiversity Corridor, would in the absence of information in relation to the protection of those trees, be likely to impact upon the visual amenity and biodiversity of the area, contrary to policies A2 (Open Space), A3 (Biodiversity), D1 (Design), D2 (Heritage) of London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017 and NE1 (Local green spaces), NE2 (Trees), NE3 (Biodiversity Corridors) and NE4 (Supporting biodiversity) of Hampstead Neighbourhood Plan 2033.",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement for car-free housing, would be likely to contribute unacceptably to parking stress and congestion in the surrounding area, contrary to polices T2 (Parking and car-free development) of London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017 and policy TT4 (Cycle and car ownership) of Hampstead Neighbourhood Plan 2033.",
    "Reason : 4 - The proposed development would not achieve required carbon reduction targets, and as such, would not minimise the effects of climate change or meet the highest feasible environmental standards, contrary to Policy CC1 (Climate change mitigation) and CC2 (Climate change adaptation measures) of London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n",
    "Reason : 5 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement securing a construction management plan, would be likely to give rise to conflicts with other road users, and be detrimental to the amenities of the area generally, contrary to polices A1(Managing the impact of development), T3 (Transport Infrastructure), T4 (Sustainable movement of goods and materials) of London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017."
