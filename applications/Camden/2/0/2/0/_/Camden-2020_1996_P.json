    "Reason : 1 - The proposed demolition of the front facade with its composition of brick, stone and distinctive cantilevered oriel bays, which makes a positive contribution to the Bloomsbury Conservation Area, and its replacement with a metal clad and glazed faï¿½ade would by virtue of its detailed design, form and materials and lack of responsiveness to the local vernacular cause less than substantial harm to the character and appearance of the Bloomsbury Conservation Area, contrary to the policies D1 and D2 of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan (2017).",
    "Reason : 2 - In the absence of a legal agreement to secure a Construction Management Plan with the associated implementation support contribution and a Construction Impact Bond, the development would fail to ensure that the development can be implemented without causing detrimental impact to residential amenity or the safe and efficient operation of the highway network in the local area. The development would therefore be contrary to policies DM1 (Delivery and monitoring), A1 (managing the impact of development) and T4 (sustainable movement of goods and materials) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement securing a Highways Contribution, would fail to mitigate the impact of the works on the adjacent highway contrary to policies A1 (Managing the impact of development), T3 (Transport Infrastructure) and DM1 (Delivery and monitoring) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.
