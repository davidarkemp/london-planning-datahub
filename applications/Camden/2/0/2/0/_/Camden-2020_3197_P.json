    "Reason : 1 - Reason for Refusal\r\n\r\nThe proposed development by reason of the loss of a light well serving a double basement, associated stone and metal parapet wall and large timber doors, would cause harm to the character and appearance of the host building and Bloomsbury Conservation Area. The form of the proposed ramp and stair by reason of its elevated position, long design and materiality of etched steel would appear at odds with the imposing neo-Classical host building, causing harm to the character and appearance of the Bloomsbury Conservation Area contrary to policies D1 (Design) and D2 (Heritage) of the Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - Reason for Refusal:\r\n\r\nThe proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement securing a Highways Contribution for the Council's contractors to carry out the proposed works to the vehicle drop-off bay and footway, would be contrary to policies A1 (Managing the impact of development), T3 (Transport Infrastructure) and DM1 (Delivery and monitoring) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.  \r\n"
