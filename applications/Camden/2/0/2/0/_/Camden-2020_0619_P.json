  "description": "Change of use from retail shop (Class A1) to 1x 1-bedroom flat and 1x studio flat (Class C3) and associated amendments to the front elevation.  ",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed change of use, in the absence of any evidence to demonstrate that the continued use as a retail shop is unviable, would result in the loss of an amenity which serves the needs of the local population contrary to policy TC3 (Shops outside of centres) of the LB Camden Local Plan 2017. ",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed amendments to the front and side elevation, by way of their proportions, inappropriate materials and unsympathetic design would fail to preserve the character and appearance of the Conservation Area contrary to policies D1 (Design) and D2 (Heritage) of the Camden Local Plan 2017, the West Kentish Town Conservation Area Appraisal and Management Strategy 2005 and policy D3 of the Kentish Town Neighbourhood Plan 2018.\r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - In the absence of a legal agreement to prevent future occupiers from obtaining car parking permits, the proposal would fail to encourage the use of sustainable methods of transport and it would therefore be contrary to policies T2 (Parking and car-free development) and CC1 (Climate change mitigation) of the LB Camden Local Plan.\r\n",
