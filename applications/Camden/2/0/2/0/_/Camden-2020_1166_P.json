  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed Automatic Teller Machine and associated alterations to the shopfront, by virtue of their design, location and illumination, would introduce an unsympathetic feature in the shopfront and add visual clutter, detrimental to the character and appearance of the host building and wider streetscene, contrary to policies D1 (Design) and D3 (Shopfronts) of the Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed Automatic Teller Machine, by virtue of its' design, location and illumination, especially at night, would cause harm to the residential amenity of neighbouring occupiers living above the shopfront in terms of increased levels of noise and disturbance, contrary to policy A1 (Managing the impact on development) of the Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed Automatic Teller Machine, by virtue of its' location, would contribute to opportunities for crime and anti-social behaviour, contrary to policy C5 (Safety and security) of the Camden Local Plan 2017. "
