    "Reason : 1 - Design, Character and Appearance\r\n\r\nThe proposed development, by virtue of its height, mass, scale, site coverage and detailed design, would be detrimental to the character and appearance of the streetscene and wider area generally, contrary to policy \r\nD1 (Design) of the Camden Local Plan 2017, and policy 2 of the Fortune Green and West Hampstead Neighbourhood Plan 2015.\r\n\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - Residential Amenity\r\n\r\nThe proposed development, due to its height, massing, scale, location, positioning of windows and terraces, would have an overbearing impact on neighbouring occupiers at Gondar House, South Mansions and properties on Hillfield Road and result in a material loss of outlook, privacy and daylight , contrary to policies A1 (Managing the impact of development) and D1 (Design) of the Camden Local Plan 2017, and policy 2 of the Fortune Green and West Hampstead Neighbourhood Plan 2015.",
    "Reason : 3 - Failure to enter into a legal agreement for a Sustainability Plan\r\n\r\nThe proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement to secure a Sustainability and Energy Plan, would fail to be sustainable in its use of resources, contrary to policies CC1 (Climate change mitigation), CC2 (Adapting to climate) and CC3 (Water and flooding) of the Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n\r\n",
    "Reason : 4 - Failure to enter into a legal agreement for a Construction Management Plan\r\n\r\nThe proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement to secure a Construction Management Plan, with associated implementation support contribution and bond, would be likely to give rise to conflicts with other road users, and be detrimental to the amenities of the area generally, contrary to policies A1 (Managing the impact of development) and DM1 (Delivery and monitoring) of Camden Local Plan 2017, and policy 7 of the Fortune Green and West Hampstead Neighbourhood Plan 2015.\r\n\r\n",
    "Reason : 5 - Failure to enter into a legal agreement for a Highways Contributions\r\n\r\nThe proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement to secure highway contributions to undertake external works outside the application site, would fail to secure adequate provision for the safety of pedestrians, cyclists and vehicles, contrary to policies A1 (Managing the impact of development), T1 (Prioritising walking, cycling and public transport) and DM1 (Delivery and monitoring) of Camden Local Plan 2017, and policy 9 of the Fortune Green and West Hampstead Neighbourhood Plan 2015. \r\n\r\n",
    "Reason : 6 - Failure to enter into a legal agreement for car-free housing\r\n\r\nThe proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement to secure a car-free development, would be likely to contribute unacceptably to parking stress and congestion in the surrounding area, contrary to policies T1 (Prioritising walking, cycling and public transport), T2 (Parking and car-free development) and DM1 (Delivery and monitoring) of Camden Local Plan 2017, and policy 9 of the Fortune Green and West Hampstead Neighbourhood Plan 2015.\r\n\r\n",
    "Reason : 7 - Failure to enter into a legal agreement for an affordable housing contribution\r\n\r\nThe proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement to secure a payment in lieu of affordable housing and to consider affordable housing cumulatively with the adjacent site at 1 Hillfield Road, would fail to maximise the contribution of the site to the supply of affordable housing in the borough, contrary to policy H4 (Maximising the supply of affordable housing) of the Camden Local Plan 2017, and Policy 1 of the Fortune Green and West Hampstead Neighbourhood Plan 2015. \r\n\r\n"
