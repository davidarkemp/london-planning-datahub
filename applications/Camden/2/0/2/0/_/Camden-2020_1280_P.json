    "Reason : 2 - The proposed access door and windows, by reason of their number, scale, design, prominent location, would appear as an inappropriate and incongruous addition would harm the character and appearance of the host building, which is listed and the that neither preserves of enhances the host property's historic significance nor the character and appearance of the surrounding Primrose Hill Conservation Area, contrary to policies D1 (Design) and D2 (Heritage) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017 and the emerging London Plan 2019.",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement to secure a Construction Management Plan (and associated support contribution), would fail to ensure that the development can be implemented without causing detrimental impact to residential amenity or the safe and efficient operation of the highway network in the local area, contrary to policies A1 and T4 of the Camden Local Plan 2017.
