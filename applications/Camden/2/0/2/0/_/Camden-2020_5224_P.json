    "Reason : 1 - The siting, size and design of the proposed extraction unit to be provided in association with the change of use would have a detrimental impact on the character and appearance of the host property and Bloomsbury Conservation Area. It would thus fail to comply with Schedule 2, Part 3, Class C, Condition C.2(1)(g) of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (Amendment) (England) Order 2015 and would be contrary to the aims of the National Planning Policy Framework 2019 (chapters 12 and 16).",

It would thus fail to comply with Schedule 2, Part 3, Class C, Condition C.2(1)(c) of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (Amendment) (England) Order 2015 and would be contrary to the aims of the National Planning Policy Framework 2019 (chapters 8, 11 and 12)."
