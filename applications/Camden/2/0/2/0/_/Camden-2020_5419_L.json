It is proposed to refurbish the building throughout, including kitchens and bathrooms. It is proposed to extend the existing staircase up a further flight to give access to the roof terrace, following the existing plan but in a lightweight material so as to be easily discernible from the existing staircase. It is proposed to replace the modern roof light with an openable roof light to replace the existing lean-to light and cabin. It is proposed to bring back the line of the railing at roof level to not be visible from the street.",
