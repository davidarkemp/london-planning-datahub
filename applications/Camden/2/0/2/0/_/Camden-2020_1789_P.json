In the event that remediation measures are identified necessary, a remediation strategy shall be included giving full details of the remediation measures required and how they are to be undertaken.  \r\n\r\nb) A verification plan shall provide details of the data that will be collected in order to demonstrate that the works set out in the remediation strategy are complete and identifying any requirements for the longer term monitoring of pollution linkages, maintenance and arrangements for contingency action.\r\n\r\nAny investigation and risk assessment must be undertaken in accordance with the requirements of the Environment Agency�s Model Procedures for the Management of Contamination (CLR11).   In the event that additional significant contamination is found at any time when carrying out the approved development it must be reported in writing immediately to the LPA. \r\n\r\nFor the avoidance of doubt, this condition can be discharged on a section by section basis. \r\n\r\nReason: To ensure the risks from land contamination to the future users of the land and neighbouring land are minimised, together with those to controlled waters, property and ecological systems, and to ensure that the development can be carried out safely without unacceptable risks to workers, neighbours and other offsite receptors, in accordance with policies G1 (Delivery and location of growth), D1 (Design), A1 (Managing the impact of development), and DM1 (Delivery and monitoring) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n",
    "Condition : 9 - Asbestos \r\n\r\nThe developer must either submit evidence that site buildings were built post 2000 or provide an intrusive pre-demolition and refurbishment asbestos survey in accordance with HSG264 supported by an appropriate mitigation scheme to control risks to occupiers.  The scheme must be written by a suitably qualified person and submitted to the Local Planning Authority (LPA) for approval before commencement.   The scheme as submitted shall demonstrably identify potential sources of asbestos contamination and detail removal or mitigation appropriate for the proposed end use. Detailed working methods are not required but the scheme of mitigation shall be independently verified to the satisfaction of the LPA prior to occupation. \r\n\r\nReason To protect occupiers of the development from the possible contamination arising in connection with the buildings on the site in accordance with policies A1 (Managing the impact of development), C1 (Health and wellbeing) and CC5 (Waste) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n",
    "Condition : 10 - Mechanical Ventilation and NO2 Filtration \r\n\r\nPrior to occupation, evidence that an appropriate NO2 filtration system on the mechanical ventilation intake has been installed and a detailed mechanism to secure maintenance of this system should be submitted to the Local Planning Authority and approved in writing.\r\n�\r\nReason: To protect the amenity of residents in accordance with policy CC4 (Air Quality) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017 and London Plan policy 7.14.\r\n",
    "Condition : 11 - Construction related impacts - Monitoring\r\n\r\nAir quality monitoring should be implemented on site. No development shall take place until:\r\n \r\na. prior to installing monitors, full details of the air quality monitors shall have been submitted to and approved by the local planning authority in writing. Such details shall include the location, number and specification of the monitors, including evidence of the fact that they have been installed in line with guidance outlined in the GLA�s Control of Dust and Emissions during Construction and Demolition Supplementary Planning Guidance;\r\n\r\nb. prior to commencement, evidence shall be submitted demonstrating that the monitors have been in place for at least 3 months prior to the proposed implementation date. \r\n\r\nThe monitors shall be retained and maintained on site for the duration of the development in accordance with the details thus approved. \r\n\r\nReason: To safeguard the amenity of adjoining premises and the area generally in accordance with the requirements of policies A1 (Managing the impact of development) and CC4 (Air quality) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n",
    "Condition : 12 - Green Roof details\r\n\r\nPrior to commencement of above-ground development, full details in respect of the green roof in the area indicated on the approved roof plan shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority. Details of the green roof provided shall include: species, planting density, substrate and a section at scale 1:20 showing that adequate depth is available in terms of the construction and long term viability of the green roof, as well as details of the maintenance programme for green roof. The buildings shall not be occupied until the approved details have been implemented and these works shall be permanently retained and maintained thereafter.\r\n�\r\nReason: In order to ensure the development undertakes reasonable measures to take account of biodiversity and the water environment in accordance with policies A3 (Biodiversity), CC2 (Adapting to climate change) and CC3 (Water and flooding) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n",
    "Condition : 13 - SuDS details\r\n\r\nPrior to commencement of above-ground development, full details of the sustainable drainage system including 95 m2 intensive green roof with minimum substrate depth of 150 mm and equipped with suitable flow controls; 144.5 m2 permeable paving; 88 m3 attenuation storage; and final outlet flow controls limiting site discharge to a maximum of 2.6 l/s, shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority. Such a system should be designed to accommodate all storms up to and including a 1:100 year storm with a 40% provision for climate change such that flooding does not occur in any part of a building or in any utility plant susceptible to water, and shall demonstrate the run off rates approved by the Local Planning Authority. If necessary, a revised drainage statement, SuDS pro-forma and supporting evidence should be included for:\r\n\r\n- The new proposed SuDS or drainage measures including storage capacities\r\n- The new proposed surface water discharge rates or volumes\r\n\r\nDetails shall include a lifetime maintenance plan, including safety measures for maintenance, and evidence from Thames Water confirming combined sewer capacity for the proposal. The systems shall thereafter be retained and maintained in accordance with the approved details. \r\n\r\nReason: To reduce the rate of surface water run-off from the buildings and limit the impact on the storm-water drainage system in accordance with policies CC2 and CC3 of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan Policies.\r\n",
    "Condition : 14 - Air quality - off road vehicles\r\n\r\nAll non-Road mobile Machinery (any mobile machine, item of transportable industrial equipment, or vehicle - with or without bodywork) of net power between 37kW and 560kW used on the site for the entirety of the [demolition and/construction] phase of the development hereby approved shall be required to meet Stage IIIA of EU Directive 97/68/EC. The site shall be registered on the NRMM register for the [demolition and/construction] phase of the development. \r\n\r\nReason: To safeguard the amenities of the adjoining occupiers, the area generally and contribution of developments to the air quality of the borough in accordance with the requirements of policies G1 (Delivery and location of growth), A1 (Managing the impact of development), CC1 (Climate change mitigation) and CC4 (Air quality) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n",
    "Condition : 15 - Cycle parking\r\n \r\nBefore the development commences, details of secure and covered cycle storage area for at least 23 cycles (including 1 accessible space) shall be submitted to and approved by the local planning authority. The applicant shall use reasonable endeavours to increase the cycle parking provision shown on the approved drawings. The approved facility shall thereafter be provided in its entirety prior to the first occupation of any of the new units, and permanently retained thereafter. \r\n\r\nReason: To ensure the development provides adequate cycle parking facilities in accordance with the requirements of policy T1 of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n",
    "Condition : 16 - Roof terraces \r\n\r\nNo flat roofs within the development shall be used as terraces without the prior express approval in writing of the Local Planning Authority. \r\n\r\nReason: To safeguard the amenities of the future occupiers and adjoining neighbours in accordance with the requirements of policy A1 of the Camden Local Plan.\r\n"
