    "Condition : 1 - No advertisement is to be displayed without the permission of the owner of the site or any other person with an interest in the site entitled to grant permission.\r\n\r\nReason: - As required by regulation 2(1) and Schedule 2 of the Town & Country Planning (Control of Advertisements) (England) Regulations 2007.\r\n",
    "Condition : 2 - No advertisement shall be sited or displayed so as to\r\n(a) endanger persons using any highway, railway, waterway, dock, harbour or aerodrome (civil or military);\r\n(b) obscure, or hinder the ready interpretation of any traffic sign, railway signal or aid to navigation by water or air; or\r\n(c) hinder the operation of any device used for the purpose of security or surveillance or for measuring the speed of any vehicle\r\n\r\nReason: - As required by regulation 2(1) and Schedule 2 of the Town & Country Planning (Control of Advertisements) (England) Regulations 2007.\r\n",
    "Condition : 3 - Any advertisement displayed and any site used for the display of advertisements, shall be maintained in a condition that does not impair the visual amenity of the site.\r\n\r\nReason: - As required by regulation 2(1) and Schedule 2 of the Town & Country Planning (Control of Advertisements) (England) Regulations 2007.\r\n",
    "Condition : 4 - Any structure or hoarding erected or used principally for the purpose of displaying advertisements shall be maintained in a safe condition.\r\n\r\nReason: - As required by regulation 2(1) and Schedule 2 of the Town & Country Planning (Control of Advertisements) (England) Regulations 2007.\r\n",

    "Reason : 1 - The proposed advertisements (signs 7 and 8), by virtue of their siting and illumination, would be incongruous and out of keeping given the character of the locations, and would introduce visual clutter detrimental to the character and appearance of the host building and wider streetscene, contrary to policies D1 (Design) and D4 (Advertisements) of the Camden Local Plan 2017."
