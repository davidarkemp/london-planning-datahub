It is therefore contrary to policies D1 (Design) and D2 (Heritage) of the LB Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed two storey rear extension, due to its size, siting and relationship with the glazed extension at the rear of no. 14 and its first floor windows, would result in a loss of light and an unacceptable sense of enclosure for the occupiers of this property.  It is therefore contrary to policy A1 (Managing the impact of development) of the LB Camden Local Plan 2017. "
