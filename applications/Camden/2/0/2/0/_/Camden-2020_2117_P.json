    "Condition : 2 - All new external work shall be carried out in materials that resemble, as closely as possible, in colour and texture those of the existing building, unless otherwise specified in the approved application. \r\n\r\nReason: To safeguard the appearance of the premises and the character of the immediate area in accordance with the requirements of policies D1 and D2 of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017. \r\n",

    "Condition : 4 - Prior to the installation of the external staircase, the two self-contained flats at Unit 4.1 and Unit 4.2 as shown on 1340-A-GA-PL-25 shall be amalgamated into one self-contained flat, Unit 4.1, as shown in drawing 1340-A-GA-PL-05 Rev B. \r\n\r\nReason: In order to safeguard a good standard of accommodation and prevent unacceptable loss of outlook to occupiers in accordance with the requirements of policies G1, H3, D1, D2 and A1 of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n",
