    "Reason : 1 - The proposed demolition, by reason of the loss of the existing building which makes a positive contribution to the Highgate Village Conservation Area, would cause harm to the character and appearance of the conservation area, contrary to policy D2 of the Camden Local Plan 2017 and Policies DH1, DH2, DH7 of the Highgate Neighbourhood Plan 2017.  \r\n ",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed replacement dwelling, by virtue of its scale, design, materiality and siting, would cause harm to the character and appearance of the street scene and the wider area, and the setting of the neighbouring listed buidling and would fail to preserve or enhance the character and appearance of the Highgate Village Conservation Area contrary to policies D1 (design)  and D2 (heritage) of the Camden Local Plan 2017 and policies DH1, DH2, DH6, DH7, DH8 of the Highgate Neighbourhood Plan 2017 and with the London Plan 2021 and the NPPF 2023.\r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed development, by virtue of insufficient evidence to justify the need for demolition of the existing building nor the use of active cooling, would result in an unsustainable development contrary to policies CC1 (climate change mitigation) and CC2 (adapting to climate change) of the Camden Local Plan 2017 and policies DH7, DH9 of the Highgate Neighbourhood Plan 2017.",
    "Reason : 4 - In the absence of an adequate Basement Impact Assessment, the proposal would likely have an adverse impact upon the land stability in the area, the local water environment surface run-off and hydrogeology, contrary to policies A1 (Managing the impact of development) and A5 (Basements) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017 and Policy DH7 of the Highgate Neighbourhood Plan 2017.\r\n",
    "Reason : 5 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement securing an affordable housing contribution, would fail to maximise the supply of affordable housing to meet the needs of households unable to access market housing, contrary to policy H4 (Maximising the supply of affordable housing) of the Camden Local Plan 2017 and policy SC1 of the Highgate Neighbourhood Plan 2017.",
    "Reason : 6 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement securing car-free housing, would contribute unacceptably to parking stress and congestion in the surrounding area and fail to promote more sustainable and efficient forms of transport and active lifestyles, contrary to policies T2 (parking and car-free development) and DM1 (delivery and monitoring) of the Camden Local Plan 2017 and Policy TR1 of the Highgate Neighbourhood Plan 2017. ",
    "Reason : 7 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement securing a construction management plan and construction impact bond, would be detrimental to the amenity of neighbouring occupiers contrary to policies A1 (managing the impact of development) and A5 (basements) of the Camden Local Plan 2017 and Polcies DH7, TR1, TR2 and TR3 of the Highgate Neighbourhood Plan 2017.  \r\n"
