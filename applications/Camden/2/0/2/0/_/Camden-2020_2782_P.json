    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development, by reason of over-development through provision of too many homes with poor quality design, would result in units with poor internal layouts and compromised levels of privacy and outlook to the detriment of future occupiers, contrary to policies D1 (Design) and H6 (Housing choice) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement to secure a \r\ncontribution to affordable housing, would fail to maximise the contribution of the site to the supply of affordable housing in the borough, contrary to policy H4 (Maximising the supply of affordable housing) of the Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement securing an Approval in Principle, would fail to mitigate the impact of the basement works on the adjacent public highway contrary to policies A1 (Managing the impact of development), T3 (Transport Infrastructure) and DM1 (Delivery and monitoring) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n",
    "Reason : 4 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement securing car-free housing, would be likely to contribute unacceptably to parking stress and congestion in the surrounding area and fail to promote more sustainable and efficient forms of transport and active lifestyles, contrary to policies T2 (Parking and car-free development) and DM1 (Delivery and monitoring) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n",
    "Reason : 5 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement securing necessary highway works, would fail to secure adequate provision for and safety of pedestrians, cyclists and vehicles, contrary to policies A1 (Managing the impact of development), T1 (Prioritising walking, cycling and public transport) and DM1 (Delivery and monitoring) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n",
    "Reason : 6 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement securing a Construction Management Plan (CMP) and associated contributions to support the implementation of the CMP, would be likely to give rise to conflicts with other road users and be detrimental to the amenities of the area generally, contrary to policies A1 (Managing the impact of development), T4 (Sustainable movement of goods and materials) and DM1 (Delivery and monitoring) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n"
