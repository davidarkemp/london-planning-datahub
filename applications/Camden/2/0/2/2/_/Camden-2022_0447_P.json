    "Condition : 3 - All new external work shall be carried out in materials that resemble, as closely as possible, in colour and texture those of the existing building, unless otherwise specified in the approved application. \r\n\r\nReason: To safeguard the appearance of the premises and the character of the immediate area in accordance with the requirements of policy D1 of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017 and policy 2 of the Fortune Green and West Hampstead Neighbourhood Plan 2015.\r\n",
    "Condition : 4 - The use of the roof as a terrace shall not commence until all parts of the balustrade hereby approved, and as shown on the approved drawings, have been constructed in their entirety. The terrace and balustrading shall be restricted only to the area shown on the approved drawings and shall be retained for as long as the roof terrace remains in use.\r\n \r\nReason: In order to prevent unreasonable and intrusive overlooking of \r\nneighbouring premises and loss of privacy associated with the terrace use, in accordance with the requirements of policy A1 of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017."
