  "description": "Erection of two storey rear/side extension to enlarge an existing HMO at 1st floor and create a new 2 bedroom HMO at 2nd floor (both Class C4); partial change of use from office (Class E) to ancillary residential space (Class C4) at ground floor; alterations to fenestration on Leverton Place; installation of PV panels on 2nd floor roof.",
  "decision_date": "08/09/2022",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed 1st and 2nd floor extensions to the existing building, by reason of their detailed design, height, size, bulk and siting, would subsume the host property and be overly bulky and dominant, thus harming the character and appearance of the host building, the streetscene and Kentish Town conservation area, contrary to policies D1 (design) and D2 (heritage) of the Camden Local Plan 2017 and policy D3 (design principles) of the Kentish Town Neighbourhood Plan 2016. \r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed development, by reason of its height, bulk and depth, would result in an increased sense of enclosure at the rear of the adjoining listed buildings on Leverton Street and thus would harm their setting, contrary to policies D1 (Design) and D2 (Heritage) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017 and policy D3 (design principles) of the Kentish Town Neighbourhood Plan 2016.  \r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed 2 flats, by reason of their inadequate floorspace, daylight and outlook and the removal of existing amenity space for Flat A, would provide poor quality accommodation, contrary to policy A1 (Managing the impact of development) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n",
    "Reason : 4 - The proposed development would result in a loss of daylight and outlook to Flats B and C within the main host building to the detriment of the occupiers' amenity, contrary to policy A1 (Managing the impact of development) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n",
    "Reason : 5 - The proposed development, by reason of its location, design and scale, would result in a loss of outlook to nos. 1 and 3 Leverton Street and nos. 1, 2 and 3 Leverton Place; a loss of sunlight to nos. 1 and 2 Leverton Place; and a loss of privacy to nos. 2 and 3 Leverton Place, to the detriment of the occupiers' amenities, contrary to policy A1 (Managing the impact of development) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n",
    "Reason : 6 - The applicant has failed to adequately demonstrate that the operation of the proposed mechanical plant would not result in a harmful noise nuisance to neighbouring residential properties, to the detriment of the occupiers' amenities, contrary to policies A1 (Managing the impact of development) and A4  (Noise and vibration) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n",
    "Reason : 7 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement securing a Construction Management Plan, associated monitoring fee and construction impact bond, would be likely to contribute unacceptably to traffic disruption and be detrimental to general highway and pedestrian safety, contrary to policies A1 (Managing the impact of development) and T4 (Sustainable movement of goods and materials) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n",
    "Reason : 8 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement for car-free housing, would be likely to contribute unacceptably to parking stress and congestion in the surrounding area and fail to promote more sustainable and efficient forms of transport, contrary to policies T1 (Prioritising walking, cycling and public transport), T2 (Parking and Car Parking) and A1 (Managing the impact of development) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n",
    "Reason : 9 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement securing a contribution to affordable housing, would fail to ensure the provision of the required amount of affordable housing for the scheme, contrary to policy H4 (Maximising the supply of affordable Housing) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n"
