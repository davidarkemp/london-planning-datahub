    "Condition : 1 - The light installation hereby permitted is for a temporary period only and shall only be permitted in association with the �Georgian Illuminations� exhibition while hosted at the John Soane Museum and shall not be for a duration of any greater than 3 calendar months in total. \r\n\r\nReason: The type of installation is not such as the local planning authority is prepared to approve, other than for a limited period, in view of its appearance. The permanent retention of the structure would be contrary to the requirements of policy D1 and D2 of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017. \r\n",
    "Condition : 2 - The development hereby permitted shall be carried out in accordance with the following approved plans: SJS-01-B, SJS-02-B, SJS-03-A, SJS-04-A, Heritage Statement, Lighting Impact Assessment, Artwork Management Plan. \r\n\r\nReason:\r\nFor the avoidance of doubt and in the interest of proper planning.\r\n",
    "Condition : 3 - Prior to the commencement of the use of the lighting, automatic time clocks shall be fitted to the lighting hereby approved to ensure that the lights do not operate outside 5pm to 11pm Monday to Sunday.\r\n \r\nReason: To safeguard the amenities of the adjoining premises and the character of the area generally in accordance with the requirements of policies D1, D2, DM1, A1 and T3 of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n",
    "Condition : 4 - The intensity of the illumination of the external lighting shall not exceed 25 candelas per square metre during the day and 25 candelas per square metre during the hours of darkness in line with the maximum permitted recommended luminance as set out by 'The Institute of Lighting Professional's 'Professional Lighting Guide 05: The Brightness of Illuminated Advertisements' 2015. \r\n \r\nReason: To ensure that the lighting does not harm the character and appearance of the streetscene and does not create a distraction to pedestrian or vehicular traffic and therefore cause a hazard to highway safety. In accordance with the requirements of policies A1, D1, D2, DM1 and T3 of the Camden Local Plan 2017 and Transport for London Guidance for Digital Roadside Advertising 2013. \r\n"
