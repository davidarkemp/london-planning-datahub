    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development, in the absence of sufficient justification demonstrating that the premises is no longer suitable for continued business use would fail to support economic activity in Camden and result in the loss of employment opportunities within the Borough contrary to policies E1 (Economic development) and E2 (Employment premises and sites) of the Camden Local Plan (2017) and Policy SW1 (Supporting small business) of the Kentish Town Neighbourhood Plan (2016).\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed residential flats, by reason of their location and their internal layout and orientation, would experience poor levels of daylight/sunlight, outlook and privacy and would therefore fail to provide an adequate level of residential amenity to the detriment of the enjoyment of future occupiers, contrary to Policies A1 (Managing the impact 2 of development) and C5 (Safety and Security) of the Camden Local Plan 2017.",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed residential flats by reason of their location and layout, would cause unacceptable harm to the amenity of the neighbouring residential occupiers by way of loss of privacy, contrary to Policy A1 of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n",
    "Reason : 4 - The proposed dormers by virtue of their size, design and siting would be unsympathetic and incongruous additions harming the character and appearance of the host building, contrary to Policies D1 (Design) of the Camden Local Plan (2017) and Policy D3 of the Kentish Town Neighbourhood Plan (2016). \r\n",
    "Reason : 5 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement to secure car-free housing, would be likely to contribute unacceptably to parking stress and congestion in the surrounding area, contrary to Polices T2 (Parking and car-free development) of the Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n",
    "Reason : 6 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement to secure a contribution to affordable housing, would fail to maximise the contribution of the site to the supply of affordable housing in the borough, contrary to Policies H4 (Maximising the supply of affordable housing) and DM1 (Delivery and monitoring) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n"
