    "Reason : 1 - The proposed 4th floor and mansard roof extension, by reason of their proposed height, bulk and detailed design, would compromise the form, character and appearance of the host building, streetscene and this part of the Bloomsbury Conservation Area and would harm the setting of the listed buildings fronting Lincoln's Inn Fields, contrary to policies D1 (Design) and D2 (Heritage) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed development would not achieve required carbon reduction targets and as such would not minimise the effects of climate change or meet the highest feasible environmental standards, contrary to policies CC1 (Climate change mitigation) and CC2 (Adapting to climate change) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement securing a financial contribution towards an off-site cycle parking space, would not provide an accessible, secure cycle parking facility and would fail to promote more sustainable and efficient forms of transport and active lifestyles, contrary to policies T1 (Prioritising walking, cycling and public transport) and DM1 (Delivery and monitoring) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n",
