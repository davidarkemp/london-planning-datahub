    "Condition : 4 - Prior to first use, the Sonair ventilation units hereby approved shall be installed in full accordance with the manufacturers specification and fitted with fire resisting intumescent sleeves through all cored holes for the full depth of wall construction. The ventilation units shall thereafter be maintained in full accordance with the manufacturers specifications and the sleeves permanently retained thereafter.\r\n\r\nReason: To safeguard fire safety and mitigate exposure to poor air quality of occupants in accordance with the requirements of policies C1 and CC4 of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n",
    "Condition : 5 - The total noise from fixed plant associated with the application site, when at a point 1m external to sensitive facades shall be at least 10 dB(A) less than the existing background measurement (LA90), expressed in dB(A), when all plant/equipment (or any part of it) is in operation unless the plant/equipment hereby permitted will have a noise that is distinguishable, discrete continuous note (whine, hiss, screech, hum) and/or if there are distinct impulses(bangs, clicks, clatters, thumps), then the noise levels from the plant/equipment at any sensitive fa�ade shall be at least 15 dB(A) below background noise level.\r\n\r\nReason: To safeguard the amenities of the premises and the area generally in accordance with the requirements of policies A1 and A4 of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n",
    "Condition : 6 - When operational, noise levels from the Sonair Ventilation system in habitable rooms of the nearest noise sensitive residential receptors should comply with internal noise levels in BS8233:.2014.  \r\n\r\nReason: To prevent noise nuisance within adjoining premises in accordance with the requirements of policies A1 and A4 of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n"
