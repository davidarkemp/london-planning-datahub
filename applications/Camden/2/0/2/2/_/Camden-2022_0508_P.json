    "Condition : 4 - The brickwork used in the construction of the extension to the front elevation shall be carried out in materials that resemble, as closely as possible, in colour and texture those of the existing building, unless otherwise specified in the approved application. \r\n\r\nReason: To safeguard the appearance of the premises and the character of the immediate area in accordance with the requirements of policy D1 and D2 of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017. \r\n",
    "Condition : 5 - The proposed windows to the front elevation at ground and first floor levels shall be timber framed and fitted with glazing bars as shown on the approved plans/elevation drawing. \r\n\r\nReason: To safeguard the appearance of the premises and the character of the immediate area in accordance with the requirements of policy D1 and D2 of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n"
