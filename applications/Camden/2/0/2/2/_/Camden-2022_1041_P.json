    "Condition : 55 - Vibration\r\nPrior to the commencement of any construction activity details of the plant and equipment proposed which are likely to give rise to vibration (such as pile driving, demolition and vibro-compaction of the ground) together with predicted vibration levels, shall be submitted in writing and approved by the Local Planning Authority in consultation with HS1.  Activities likely to cause vibration in the vicinity of HS1 infrastructure such that a peak particle velocity (PPV) of 5mm/s may be exceeded at the railway boundary will be subject to agreement in advance. \r\n Where activities could give rise to PPV of 5mm/s or greater, a vibration and settlement monitoring regime shall be submitted in writing for approval by the Local Planning Authority in consultation with HS1.  It shall be put in place prior to the start of works.  HS1 shall be provided reasonable access to the results of monitoring.\r\n\r\nReason: No details of vibration have been provided.  To ensure that vibration does not prejudice safety, operation and structural integrity of HS1 in accordance with the requirements of policies G1, D1, A1, and DM1 of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n",
    "Condition : 56 - Dazzle, glare and distraction from solar reflection \r\nThe development shall be so designed to avoid dazzle and glare from solar reflection which could cause hazard or distraction to operators of HS1.  Prior to the commencement of the relevant part of the works, the reflectivity and the orientation of specular (i.e. polished) reflective surfaces such as glazing or non-matt metal shall be submitted in writing and approved by the Local Planning Authority in consultation with HS1.  \r\n\r\nReason: Depending upon the orientation of the faï¿½ade or component and the position of the sun, specular reflection can interfere with sighting of signals in accordance with the requirements of policies G1, D1, A1, and DM1 of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n",
    "Condition : 57 - St Pancras Station and Thameslink Box HS1 Assets \r\nPrior to the commencement of development, a risk assessment should be carried out to identify the areas of the site and proposed activities where there may be a risk of the malfunction or failure of any part of the construction or permanent development to St Pancras Station and Thameslink Box Assets, with particular attention to loading. Appropriate mitigation to manage these risks should be incorporated into the development and the details submitted in writing and approved by the Local Planning Authority in consultation with HS1.   \r\n\r\nReason: No assessment has been undertaken to identify the risks, if any, and no mitigation has been provided.  The development should take into account residual risks arising from HS1 in accordance with the requirements of policies G1, D1, A1, and DM1 of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n"
