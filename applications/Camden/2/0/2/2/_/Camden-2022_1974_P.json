    "Reason : 1 - The proposed glazed screen would, by virtue of its inappropriate form, siting, scale and design, detract from the design of the building and harm the character and appearance of the conservation area contrary to policies D1 (Design) and D2 (Heritage) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - Enclosure of the existing green roof within each property's individual roof terrace boundary would increase the risk of use of the area as a terrace and threaten the long-term viability of the green roof, thereby reducing the sustainability and biodiversity value of the development contrary to policy contrary to policies A3 (Biodiversity), CC2 (Climate change adaptation measures) and CC3 (Water and flooding) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed glazed screen would introduce additional built form on the top floor of the building, which would have an overbearing impact on the rear of 68-88 Gloucester Avenue and cause loss of outlook to the occupiers contrary to policy A1 (Amenity) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017."
