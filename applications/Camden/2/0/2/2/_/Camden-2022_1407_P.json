    "Reason : 1 - The proposed mansard roof extension, by reason of its massing, form, height, introduction of front dormers, and location within a group of properties with an unaltered roofline, would be detrimental to the character and appearance of the host dwelling and group of buildings of which it forms a part, and would thus harm the character and appearance of the Dartmouth Park Conservation Area, contrary to policies D1 and D2 of the Camden Local Plan 2017 and policies DC2, DC3, DC4 of Dartmouth Park Neighbourhood Plan."
