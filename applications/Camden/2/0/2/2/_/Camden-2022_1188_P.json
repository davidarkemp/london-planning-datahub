    "Reason : 1 - The proposed roof terrace and balustrades, by virtue of their location, design, bulk and massing, would result in an incongruous and dominant addition to the existing building. This would cause harm to the character and appearance of the area, local roofscape and streetscene, contrary to Policies D1 (Design) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017 and Policy 2 (Design and Character) of the Fortune Green and West Hampstead Neighbourhood Plan 2016. ",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed terrace, due to its siting and location, would result in direct overlooking, loss of privacy for adjacent neighbours on Solent Road and Sumatra Road It would therefore be contrary to policy A1 (Managing the impacts of development) of the 2 London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017."
