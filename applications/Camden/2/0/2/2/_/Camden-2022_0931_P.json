    "Condition : 4 - Within 1 month of the date of this decision notice, a post-installation noise assessment shall be carried out and be submitted to the Council for approval in writing, to confirm compliance with the noise criteria and with details of any additional steps taken to mitigate noise as identified in the supporting Noise Impact Assessment from Nova Acoustics (ref. 7107SC version 001) dated 02/03/2022. All approved details shall be implemented, and thereafter, be permanently retained and maintained in accordance with the manufacturers' recommendations. The external noise level emitted from plant, machinery or equipment at the development hereby approved, along with any specified approved noise mitigation, shall be lower than the typical existing background noise level by at least 10dBA, by 15dBA where the source is tonal, as assessed according to BS4142:2014 at the nearest and/or most affected noise sensitive premises, with all machinery operating together at maximum capacity.\r\n\r\nReason: To ensure that the amenity of occupiers of the development site and surrounding premises is not adversely affected by noise from all equipment in accordance with the requirements of policies A1 and A4 of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n",
