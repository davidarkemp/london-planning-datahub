    "Reason : 1 - The proposed new dwelling, by reason of its detailed design, siting, footprint, height, scale, bulk and excavation of garden space would harm the character and appearance of the streetscene, Hampstead conservation area and the setting of the Grade II listed Rosslyn Church, contrary to policies D1 (Design) and D2 (Heritage) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017 and policies DH1 (design) and DH2 (Conservation areas and listed buildings) of the Hampstead Neighbourhood Plan (2018).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed new dwelling, by reason of its siting and scale, would result in a loss of outlook to the residential property at no. 15 Kemplay Road contrary to policy A1 (Managing the impact of development) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.   ",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement securing a Construction Management Plan, associated monitoring fee and construction bond, would be likely to contribute unacceptably to traffic disruption and be detrimental to general highway and pedestrian safety and neighbour amenity contrary to policies A1 (Managing the impact of development) and T4 (Sustainable movement of goods and materials) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017 Policy BA3 (Construction Management Plans) of the Hampstead Neighbourhood Plan (2018).",
    "Reason : 4 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement securing financial contributions towards highways works, would fail to secure adequate provision for and safety of pedestrians, cyclists and vehicles, contrary to policies T3 (Transport infrastructure) and A1 (Managing the impact of development) of London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017 and Policy TT2 (Pedestrian environments) of the Hampstead Neighbourhood Plan (2018). \r\n \r\n",
    "Reason : 5 - In the absence of a legal agreement for car-free development, the proposed development would be likely to contribute unacceptably to parking stress and congestion in the surrounding area and fail to promote more sustainable and efficient forms of transport, contrary to policies T1 (Prioritising walking, cycling and public transport), T2 (Parking and Car Parking) and A1 (Managing the impact of development) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017 and Policy TT4 (Cycle and car ownership) of the Hampstead Neighbourhood Plan (2018)."
