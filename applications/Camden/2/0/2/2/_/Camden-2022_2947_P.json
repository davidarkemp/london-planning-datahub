Installation of rooflights in main roof and replacement window on ground floor at side.",

    "Reason : 1 - The proposed two storey rear extension, by reason of its siting, form, height, and design, would fail to preserve or enhance the architectural and historic form of the host building, the terrace, and the surrounding area. It would harm the character and appearance of the Conservation Area, and harm the setting of the neighbouring listed 'Pineapple' public house.  It would therefore be contrary to policies D1 and D2 of the Camden Local Plan 2017 and policy D3 of the Kentish Town Neighbourhood Plan 2016."
