    "Reason : 1 - The design, scale, and bulk of the proposed two storey side extension significantly detracts from the architectural character of the host building, the architectural and historic merits of neighbouring Listed buildings and the character and appearance of the conservation area. The proposal is therefore contrary to policies D1 and D2 of the Camden Local Plan and policies DH1 and DH2 of the Hampstead Neighbourhood Plan. "
