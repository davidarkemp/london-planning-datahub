    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development, by reason of its scale, bulk, location and detailed design would result in an incongruous and prominent development, which would detract from the character and appearance of the host building, the wider streetscene and the setting of the Grade II Listed Help Centre contrary to policies D1 (Design) and D2 (Heritage) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017 and CPG design guidance. ",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed development by reason of its scale, bulk and location to neighbouring residential properties and in the absence of a daylight/sunlight report, would cause undue harm to the residential amenity in terms of overlooking, outlook and access to daylight/sunlight for the neighbouring residential properties (particularly, 3rd floor flat at No.232 and to Nos.228 and 230 Kilburn High Road), contrary to policy A1 (Amenity) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017. ",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed terrace, due to its size, siting and scale, would have a detrimental impact on the amenities of properties along Gascony Avenue (Nos.1, 3 and 5) and Kilburn High Road (Nos.232 and 230) in regards to loss of privacy through overlooking, poor outlook and noise nuisance, contrary to policy A1 (Amenity) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.",
    "Reason : 4 - The proposal development, in the absence of a legal agreement securing car-free housing, would be likely to contribute unacceptably to parking stress and congestion in the surrounding area, contrary to Policy T2 (Parking and car-free development) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.",
    "Reason : 5 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement securing the installation costs of 1 cycle parking space, would fail to promote the use of sustainable means of travel or ensure a safe and accessible environment for cyclists contrary to policy T1 (Prioritising walking, cycling and public transport) of the�London Borough of Camden�Local Plan 2017.�\r\n"
