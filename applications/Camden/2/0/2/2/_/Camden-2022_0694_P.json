    "Reason : 1 - The proposed extension, by reason of its height, scale, bulk and design, would represent a prominent and incongruous addition that would not be subordinate and would cause harm to the original character and appearance of the host building, adjoining terrace and the surrounding area, contrary to policy D1 (Design) of the Camden Local Plan 2017 and Policy 2 of the Fortune Green and West Hampstead Neighbourhood Plan 2015.\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed residential unit, by reason of its size, design and arrangement, would receive insufficient daylight/sunlight and outlook and would fall short of the minimum floorspace standard for a dwelling of this size. It would thus result in sub-standard accommodation, which would be harmful to the amenities of future occupiers, contrary to policies D1 (Design) and H6 (Housing choice and mix) of the Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement for car-free housing, would be likely to contribute unacceptably to parking stress and congestion in the surrounding area, contrary to policies T1 (Prioritising walking, cycling and public transport), T2 (Parking and Car Parking) and A1 (Managing the impact of development) of the Camden Local Plan 2017 and Policy 4 of the Fortune Green and West Hampstead Neighbourhood Plan 2015.\r\n"
