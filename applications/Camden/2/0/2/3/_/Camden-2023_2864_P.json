    "Condition : 2 - The development hereby permitted shall be carried out in accordance with the following approved plans:\r\n\r\n(Prefix 36-37GRS) PP4-01, PP4-02, PP4-03, Location Plan, Design and Access Statement, Basement Impact Assessment (dated 12 December 2023, prepared by Simpson Consulting Engineers), Addendum to Basement Impact Assessment (dated 4 March 2024, prepared by Simpson Consulting Engineers), Land Stability and Building Drainage Assessment (dated March 2024, prepared by RSK Geosciences)\r\n\r\nReason: For the avoidance of doubt and in the interest of proper planning.\r\n",
    "Condition : 3 - All new external work shall be carried out in materials that resemble, as closely as possible, in colour and texture those of the existing building, unless otherwise specified in the approved application. \r\n\r\nReason: To safeguard the appearance of the premises and the character of the immediate area in accordance with the requirements of policies D1 and D2 of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017. \r\n",
    "Condition : 4 - The development hereby approved shall not commence until such time as a suitably qualified chartered engineer with membership of the appropriate professional body has been appointed to inspect, check for compliance with the design (as approved by the local planning authority and building control body) and monitor the critical elements of both permanent and temporary basement construction works throughout their duration. Details of the appointment and the appointee's responsibilities shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority prior to the commencement of development. Any subsequent change or reappointment shall be confirmed forthwith for the duration of the construction works.�\n\n�\r\n\r\n\n\nReason: To ensure proper consideration of the structural stability of neighbouring buildings and to safeguard the appearance and character of the immediate area in accordance with the requirements of policies D1, D2 and A5 of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n",
    "Condition : 5 - The development shall not be carried out other than in strict accordance with the methodologies, recommendations and requirements of the Basement Impact Assessment (dated 12 December 2023, addendum dated 4 March 2024, prepared by Simpson Consulting Engineers and Basement Impact Assessment Audit dated March 2024 prepared by Campbell Reith) hereby approved, and the confirmation at the detailed design stage that the damage impact assessment would be limited to Burland Category 1.�\n\n\r\n�\r\n\n\nReason: To ensure proper consideration of the structural stability of neighbouring buildings and to safeguard the appearance and character of the immediate area in accordance with the requirements of policies D1, D2 and A5 of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n",

Any piling must be undertaken in accordance with the terms of the approved piling method statement.\r\n\r\nReason: The proposed works will be in close proximity to underground sewerage utility infrastructure.
