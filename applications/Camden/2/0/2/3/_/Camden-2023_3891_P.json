    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development, by virtue of the substantial demolition of the existing positively contributing building, and the unsympathetic architectural proportions of the replacement building, its overly prominent roof addition, inappropriate materials and side extension infilling an important gap between buildings, would be harmful to the character and appearance of the Camden Square Conservation Area and the wider streetscape.  It would therefore be contrary to policies D1 (design) and D2 (heritage) of the Camden Local Plan 2017.  It would also be contrary to the London Plan 2021 and NPPF 2023.\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - In the absence of sufficient evidence to demonstrate that it is not possible to substantially retain and re-use the existing building, the proposed substantial demolition would fail to promote sustainable development and the efficient use of resources. It is therefore contrary to policy CC1 (climate change mitigation) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.  It is also contrary to the London Plan 2012 and the NPPF 2023.\r\n\r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement securing car-free housing, would contribute unacceptably to parking stress and congestion in the surrounding area and fail to promote more sustainable and efficient forms of transport and active lifestyles, contrary to policies T2 (parking and car-free development) and DM1 (delivery and monitoring) of the Camden Local Plan 2017.  It is also contrary to the London Plan 2021 and the NPPF 2023.\r\n\r\n",
    "Reason : 4 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement to secure a construction management plan, construction impact bond and a financial  contribution for construction management plan monitoring, would be likely to give rise to conflicts with other road users and be detrimental to the amenities of the area generally, contrary to policies G1 (Delivery and location of growth), A1 (Managing the impact of development), T3 (Transport Infrastructure), T4 (Sustainable movement of goods and materials), DM1 (Delivery and monitoring), A4 (Noise and Vibration) and CC4 (Air quality) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.  It is also contrary to the London Plan 2021 and the NPPF 2023.\r\n\r\n",
    "Reason : 5 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement securing a payment in lieu of affordable housing, would fail to maximise the site's contribution to the supply of affordable housing in the borough, contrary to policy H4 (Maximising the supply of affordable Housing) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.  It is also contrary to the London Plan 2021 and the NPPF 2023.\r\n",
    "Reason : 6 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement securing  \r\ncontributions to pedestrian, cycling and environmental improvements and cycle parking in the area, would fail to make sufficient provision in a sustainable manner for the increased trips generated by the development thus causing a cumulative detrimental impact on the borough's transport network, contrary to policies A1 (Managing the impact of development) and T1 (Prioritising walking, cycling and public transport) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.  It is also contrary to the London Plan 2021 and the NPPF 2023.\r\n\r\n"
