  "description": "The site is a grade-II-listed modernist school of 1967. The applicant wishes to improve circulation and security, with proposals centred upon the main entrance hall. To do this, he plans to alter back-of-house concrete block partitions and demolish a retrofitted wheelchair ramp, providing it within an existing concrete podium. A timber security hut will be sited in the centre of the hallway to control access. To improve the environment, it is also proposed to remove non-original paint and floor finishes from the walls and floor and polish the concrete so exposed. The walls and floor will not be repainted/re-covered. The fabric to be lost is comparatively modern and lacking in distinctive plan form, and some of it is not original; and the building is large and robust. The works to strip back and polish the concrete present a heritage benefit. The proposal is likely to result in a public benefit, offsetting what less-than-substantial harm will occur. The security hut will be fully reversible. The proposed works will not harm the special interest of the listed building. However, any works other than those specifically shown in the consented drawings are unauthorised. If further works are found to be needed, the permission of the council's conservation team must be obtained in writing, and further listed building consent may be required. The site's planning history has been taken into account in making this decision. Particular attention has been paid to the desirability of preserving the special interest of the listed building, under s.16 of the Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas Act 1990 as amended by the Enterprise and Regulatory Reform Act (ERR) 2013 As such, the proposal is in general accordance with policy D2 of the Camden Local Plan 2017. The proposed development also accords with the London Plan 2021.",
