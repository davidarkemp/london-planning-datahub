    "Reason : 1 - The proposed erection of an additional storey, by reason of its location, scale, and height would result in an incongruous and inappropriate addition that would be detrimental to the character and appearance of the host building, terrace of adjoining buildings, streetscene, and wider Belsize Conservation Area, contrary to Policies D1 (Design) and D2 (Heritage) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed erection of an additional storey, by reason of its location, scale, and height, in the absence of a daylight and sunlight report, would have a detrimental impact on neighbouring light levels and would therefore cause harm to the amenity of nearby occupiers, contrary to Policy A1 (Managing the impact of development) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n",
