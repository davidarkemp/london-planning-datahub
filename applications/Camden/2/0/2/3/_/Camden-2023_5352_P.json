  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - In the absence of sufficient evidence to demonstrate that it is not possible to substantially retain and re-use the existing building, the proposed substantial demolition would fail to promote sustainable development and the efficient use of resources. It is therefore contrary to policy CC1 (Climate change mitigation) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.  It is also contrary to the London Plan 2012 and the NPPF 2023.  \r\n\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposal, by way of its size, siting and layout, form and architectural appearance, would be harmful to the context, character, openness, heritage and landscape value of the site, the streetscene and the Conservation Area.  It would fail to preserve the character and appearance of the Conservation Area and would be contrary to policies A2 (Open Space), D1 (Design) and D2 (Heritage) of the Local Plan and policies SD2 (Redington Frognal Conservation Area) and BGI 1 (Gardens and Ecology) of the Redington Frognal Neighbourhood Plan (2021).  It would also be contrary to the London Plan 2021 and NPPF 2023.  \r\n\r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed development, by way of its siting, would result in the loss of several existing trees which would not be adequately replaced in terms of sizes, species and numbers.  The net loss of trees would result in a significant loss of amenity and biodiversity at the site contrary to policy A3 (Biodiversity) of the Camden Local Plan 2017 and policy BGI1 (Gardens and Ecology) of the Redington Frognal Neighbourhood Plan (2021).  It is also contrary to the London Plan 2021 and the NPPF 2023.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
    "Reason : 4 - The proposed development, by way of the provision of 4 on-site car parking spaces, would fail to promote reduced car use in the interests of climate change mitigation.  It would therefore be contrary to policies T2 (Parking and car-free development) and CC1 (Climate change mitigation) of the Camden Local Plan.  It would also be contrary to the London Plan 2021 and NPPF 2023.  \r\n\r\n\r\n",
    "Reason : 5 - The proposal lacks sufficient detail to ensure that the storage and management of refuse and recycling would be adequately provided for.  As such, the proposals do not comply with policy D1 (Design), A1 (Managing the impact of development) or CC5 (Waste).  It would also be contrary to the London Plan 2021 and NPPF 2023\r\n",
    "Reason : 6 - The development would not provide level access and it would not meet the requirements for inclusive design and accessibility.  The lift and lift lobby would be inadequately sized for all users.  The proposal is therefore contrary to policies C6 (Access for all), D1 (Design) and H6 (Housing choice and mix) of the Camden Local Plan 2017. It is also contrary to the London Plan 2021 and NPPF 2023. \r\n\r\n\r\n",
    "Reason : 7 - The proposed development, in the absence of a Plant Noise Assessment, would potentially result in undue noise and disturbance for neighbouring occupiers.   It would therefore be contrary to policy A1 (Managing the impact of development) and policy A4 (Noise and Vibration) of the Camden Local Plan 2017.  It would also be contrary to the London Plan 2021 and NPPF 2023. \r\n\r\n",
    "Reason : 8 - In the absence of a legal agreement to prevent future occupiers from obtaining parking permits (car free development) and to limit parking permits to existing occupiers only the proposal would fail to promote reduced car use in the interests of climate change mitigation.  It would therefore be contrary to policies T2 (Parking and car-free development) and CC1 (Climate change mitigation) of the Camden Local Plan.  It would also be contrary to the London Plan 2021 and NPPF 2023. \r\n\r\n\r\n",
    "Reason : 9 - In the absence of a legal agreement to secure a financial contribution of �20,000 towards pedestrian, cycling and environmental improvements in the vicinity of the site, the proposal would fail to safeguard the efficiency of the local transport infrastructure.   It would therefore be contrary to policy T3 (Transport infrastructure) of the Camden Local Plan.  It would also be contrary to the London Plan 2021 and NPPF 2023.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
    "Reason : 10 - In the absence of a legal agreement to secure an on-street disabled persons car parking space, the proposal would result on car parking on site contrary to the policy for reducing car use in the interests of climate change mitigation in new development.  It would therefore be contrary to policies T2 (Parking and car-free development) and CC1 (Climate change mitigation) of the Camden Local Plan.  It would also be contrary to the London Plan 2021 and NPPF 2023. \r\n\r\n\r\n",
    "Reason : 11 - In the absence of a legal agreement to secure a Demolition & Construction Management Plan and associated Implementation Support Contribution of �10,116 and Impact Bond of �16,000, the demolition and construction works would potentially harm neighbouring amenity and the safe and efficient operation of the local highway network.  The proposal is therefore contrary to policies A1 (Managing the impact of development) and T4 (Sustainable movement of goods and materials of the Camden Local Plan.  It would also be contrary to the London Plan 2021 and NPPF 2023.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
    "Reason : 12 - In the absence of a Section 106 highways contribution for repaving the footway and for removing the crossovers and reinstating the footway over, the proposed development would potentially result in adverse effects on the safety and efficiency of the highway.  It would therefore be contrary to policy T3 (Transport infrastructure) of the Camden Local Plan.  It would also be contrary to the London Plan 2021 and NPPF 2023. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
    "Reason : 13 - In the absence of a legal agreement to secure the zero carbon off-set payment of �11,057 the proposal would fail to mitigate sufficiently against climate change.  It is therefore contrary to policies CC1 (Climate change mitigation) and CC2 (Adapting to climate change) of the Camden Local Plan 2017. It is also contrary to the London Plan 2021 and NPPF 2023. \r\n\r\n\r\n",
    "Reason : 14 - In the absence of a legal agreement to secure an Energy and Sustainability Plan, the proposal would fail to mitigate sufficiently against climate change.  It is therefore contrary to policies CC1 (Climate change mitigation) and CC2 (Adapting to climate change) of the Camden Local Plan 2017. It is also contrary to the London Plan 2021 and NPPF 2023."
