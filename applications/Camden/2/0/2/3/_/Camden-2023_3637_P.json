    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development would result in an unduly large and out of character development within Camden High Street that would overwhelm the host property and be visually detrimental to the street scene. The proposal is therefore contrary to policies A1 (Managing the impact of development) and D1 (Design) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed flats at first and third floor, by virtue of failing the minimum gross internal area for the corresponding units would fail to provide an acceptable level of residential amenity to any future occupants. The proposal is therefore contrary to policy D6 of the London Plan 2021, and policies H6 (Housing choice and mix) and H7 (Large and small homes) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement securing an affordable housing contribution, would fail to maximise the supply of affordable housing to meet the needs of households unable to access market housing, contrary to policy H4 (Maximising the supply of affordable housing) of the Camden Local Plan 2017.",
    "Reason : 4 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement securing car-free housing, would contribute unacceptably to parking stress and congestion in the surrounding area and fail to promote more sustainable and efficient forms of transport and active lifestyles, contrary to policies T2 (Parking and car-free development) and DM1 (Delivery and monitoring) of the Camden Local Plan 2017.",
    "Reason : 5 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement securing a cycle parking contribution of ï¿½3,600 would contribute unacceptably to parking stress and congestion in the surrounding area and fail to promote more sustainable and efficient forms of transport and active lifestyles, contrary to policies T1 (Prioritising walking, cycling and public transport) and DM1 (Delivery and monitoring) of the Camden Local Plan 2017.",
    "Reason : 6 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement securing a CMP, CMP Implementation Support Contribution of ï¿½4,194 and the Impact Bond of ï¿½8,000, would contribute unacceptably to the harm of the local amenity and the safe movement of pedestrians, cyclists and other road users, which would likely to be detrimental to the amenities of the area generally, contrary to policies G1 (Delivery and location of growth), A1 (Managing the impact of development), T3 (Transport Infrastructure), T4 (Sustainable movement of goods and materials), DM1 (Delivery and monitoring), A4 (Noise and Vibration) and CC4 (Air quality) of the Camden Local Plan 2017."
