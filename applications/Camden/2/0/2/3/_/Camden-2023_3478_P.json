    "Reason : 1 - The proposed outbuilding by way of its siting and appearance, including its size, scale and materials would fail to appear as a subordinate garden building, it would be over-dominant and inappropriate in the garden, harmful to the character of the site, the setting of the building/terrace and the character and appearance of the Conservation Area.  It would therefore be contrary to policies D1 and D2 of the Camden Local Plan 2017 and policies DH1 and DH2 of the Hampstead Neighbourhood Plan 2018. It would also be contrary to the London Plan 2012 and the NPPF 2023.\r\n",

The proposal would therefore be contrary to policy A1 of the Camden Local Plan.  It would also be contrary to the London Plan 2012 and the NPPF 2023. ",
