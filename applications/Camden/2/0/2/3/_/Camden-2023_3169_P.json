    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development, by reason of the siting and height of the building, and poor-quality design, would result in an incongruous form development, which would fail to make the best use of land and optimise the capacity of the site, and would appear out of context when compared to surrounding properties, causing harm to the character and appearance of the street scene, contrary to Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy D1 of the Camden Local Pan 2017.  ",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed development, by reason of the siting and height of the building, would result in unacceptable harm to neighbouring amenity of the immediately adjacent ground and first floor flats within Block D by way of creating an increased sense of enclosure and overbearing, and a reduction daylight, contrary to Policy A1 of the of the Camden Local Pan 2017.  ",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed development would provide unacceptable and substandard living accommodation by way of failure to provide sufficient floor to ceiling height, the poor outlook and light, and the absence of a private external amenity space, contrary to Policy D6 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy H6 and D1 of the Camden Local Pan 2017.  ",
    "Reason : 4 - The proposed development, in the absence of an Air Quality Assessment, has failed to demonstrate that future occupants would not be exposed to unacceptable levels of air pollution and subsequently that the site is suitable for residential use, contrary to Policy C1 and CC4 of the Camden Local Plan 2017.",
    "Reason : 5 - In the absence of a legal agreement securing an affordable housing contribution, the development would fail to maximise the supply of affordable housing to meet the needs of households unable to access market housing, contrary to Policy H4 of the Camden Local Plan 2017. ",
    "Reason : 6 - In the absence of a legal agreement securing the development as car-free, the development would contribute to parking stress, congestion in the surrounding area, environmental impacts, and fail to promote more sustainable and efficient forms of transport and active lifestyles, contrary to Policies C1, CC4, T1, T2, and DM1 of the Camden Local Plan 2017.",
    "Reason : 7 - In the absence of a legal agreement securing a Construction Management Plan, construction impact bond and an implementation and monitoring fee, would be likely to give rise to conflicts with other road users and be detrimental to the amenities of the area generally, contrary to policies G1, A1, A4, CC4, T3, T4, and DM1 of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017."
