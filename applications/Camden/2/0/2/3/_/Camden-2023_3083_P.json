    "Reason : 1 - The proposed ground floor and first floor rear extension, by reason of their scale, material and design would be detrimental to the character and appearance of the host building, streetscene and surrounding area. This would harm the significance of the host listed building, the adjacent Grade II listed building at no.26 Ferncroft Avenue due to the impact on its setting, and the significance of the Redington/Frognal Conservation Area. The proposal is therefore contrary to policies D1 (Design) and D2 (Heritage) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017 and SD1, SD2, SD4, SD5 and SD6 of the Redington Frognal Neighbourhood Plan 2021.",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed removal of the large, mature London Plane Tree in the rear garden, in the absence of adequate information demonstrating that the tree is causing significant structural issues to the host property, would contrary to policy A3 (Biodiversity) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017. The removal of the tree also harms the significance of the Redington/Frognal Conservation Area and is therefore contrary to policies D1 (Design) and D2 (Heritage) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017 and SD1, SD2, BGI1 and BGI2 of the Redington Frognal Neighbourhood Plan (2021)."
