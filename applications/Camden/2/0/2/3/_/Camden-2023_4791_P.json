    "Condition : 2 - The external noise level emitted from plant, machinery or equipment at the development hereby approved shall be lower than the typical existing background noise level by at least 10dBA, or by 15dBA where the source is tonal, as assessed according to BS4142:2014 at the nearest and/or most affected noise sensitive premises, with all machinery operating together at maximum capacity.\r\n\r\nReason: To safeguard the amenities of the adjoining premises and the area generally in accordance with the requirements of policies A1 and A4 of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n",
    "Condition : 3 - Within 6 weeks of this decision, the air conditioning condensers hereby approved shall be mounted with proprietary anti-vibration isolators and fan motors shall be vibration-isolated from the casing and adequately silenced and maintained as such. \r\n\r\nReason: To safeguard the amenities of the adjoining premises and the area generally in accordance with the requirements of policies A1 and A4 of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n",
    "Condition : 4 - The welfare cabins and hoarding hereby permitted are for a temporary period only and shall be removed on or before 4th March 2027. \r\n\r\nReason: The type of structure is not such as the local planning authority is prepared to approve, other than for a limited period, in view of its appearance.
