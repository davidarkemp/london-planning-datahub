    "Condition : 1 - The development hereby permitted must be begun not later than the end of three years from the date of this permission.\r\n\r\nReason: In order to comply with the provisions of Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended).\r\n",
    "Condition : 2 - The development hereby permitted shall be carried out in accordance with the following approved plans- 01, rev A2; 02, rev A9; 03, rev A3; 04, rev A1; 05, rev A2.\r\n\r\nReason: For the avoidance of doubt and in the interest of proper planning.\r\n\r\n",
    "Condition : 3 - All new external work shall be carried out in materials that resemble, as closely as possible, in colour and texture those of the existing building, unless otherwise specified in the approved application. \r\n\r\nReason: To safeguard the appearance of the premises and the character of the immediate area in accordance with the requirements of policy D1 and D2 of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017. \r\n",
    "Condition : 4 - This permission is personal to Charalambos Loizou and shall endure for the period of their occupation only.  Within 12 months of Charalambos Loizou vacating the premises, the parking space and vehicle entry gate shall be removed and the front yard and front boundary treatment shall be remediated in accordance Proposed Remediation Ground Floor Plan & Front Elevation Plan, dwg. no. 05, rev A2, dated September 2023, and referenced in condition 2 of this consent.\r\n\r\nReason: In recognition of the special circumstances of the applicant and to protect the long term character of the conservation area, in accordance with policies D1, D2, C6 and T2 of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n\r\n",
    "Condition : 5 - All hard and soft landscaping works shall be carried out in accordance with the approved landscape details by not later than the end of the planting season following completion of the development. Any trees or areas of planting (including trees existing at the outset of the development other than those indicated to be removed) which, within a period of 5 years from the completion of the development, die, are removed or become seriously damaged or diseased, shall be replaced as soon as is reasonably possible and, in any case, by not later than the end of the following planting season, with others of similar size and species, unless the local planning authority gives written consent to any variation.\r\n\r\nReason: To ensure that the landscaping is carried out within a reasonable period and to maintain a high quality of visual amenity in the scheme in accordance with the requirements of policies A2, A3, D1 and D2 of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n\r\n",
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development, by virtue of the loss of the front boundary wall and front garden soft landscaping and its replacement with a hardstanding for carparking, would result in the loss of a traditional front garden landscape and boundary treatment thus harming the character and appearance of the host property, streetscene and Primrose Hill Conservation Area, contrary to policies D1 (Design) and D2 (Heritage) of the Local Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017. \r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The development, by reason of the promotion of car use, loss of onstreet parking and impact on public highway safety, would ulimately in the long-term, encourage the use of unsustainable modes of transport, increase parking stress and harm local amenity, contrary to policies T1 (Prioritising walking, cycling and public transport), T2 (Parking and car-freedevelopment) and A1 (Managing the impact of development) of the Local Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017. \r\n"
