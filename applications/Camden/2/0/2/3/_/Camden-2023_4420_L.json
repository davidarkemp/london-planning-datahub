Two small holes will be drilled into the mortar area of the brick work of the exterior wall. An adhesive will be inserted into the holes to keep the screws permanently in place. This is how the plaque will be affixed guaranteeing no part of the original brickwork will be affected. Images of the plaque including dimensions have been incorporated in this application. \n",
