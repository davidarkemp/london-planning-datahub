    "Reason : 1 - The proposed roof extension, by reason of its height, location, detailed design and visual prominence, would be inappropriate and would detract from the setting and appearance of the adjoining buildings particularly at 38 St. Paul's Crescent. The proposal would have a detrimental impact on long views to and from St. Paul's Crescent and therefore would be harmful to the character and appearance of the host building, the streetscene and the Conservation Area. As such the proposal is contrary to policies D1 (design) and D2 (heritage) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed roof extension by virtue of its size and location, would give rise to a loss of outlook and increased sense of enclosure  to properties no.100a and 102 Agar Grove contrary to policy A1 (Managing the impact of development) of Camden's Local Plan 2017."
