  "description": "The proposed works are to be undertaken to the external building fabric of the following locations: RHS of Holborn, LHS of Leather Lane, Courtyard A, Courtyard B/C archway and Courtyard C. Works are to include the following: Overflow Chutes - Core drill of c. 50mm diameter holes from the inside of the parapet gutter through to the external side of the wall. - Line the core drilled bore hole with lead and dress into the inside of the parapet. - The chute will protrude from the elevation c.50-60mm. The variance will depend on any obstructions below the protrusion point to ensure no water runs down the facade. Pigeon Wire - Drill small holes at intervals of c. 1.50m and install 25mm masonry rivets for the stainless steel posts to be inserted into and grouted into place. Enough room is to be left at either end of the runs for an anchor point, c. 115mm. - Install the anchor point via a small drill hole and again, a 25mm masonry rivet. - Install the bird wire as per the manufacturers guidance.",
