    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development, by virtue of its siting, scale, mass, and detailed design, would be harmful to the open nature of the site and would be harmful to the character and appearance of the streetscene and the wider area, including the setting of Hampstead Cricket Club as a designated open space, and would fail to preserve or enhance the character or appearance of the West End Green Conservation Area contrary to policies D1 (Design), D2 (Heritage) and A2 (Open Spaces) of the Camden Local Plan 2017 and policies 2 (Design and Character) ,3 (Safeguarding & enhancing Conservation Areas & heritage assets) and 16 (Local Green Space) of the Fortune Green and West Hampstead Neighbourhood Plan 2015. \r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed development would result in harmful overlooking of communal gardens and would be detrimental to the amenity of neighbouring occupiers contrary to policies A1 (Amenity) and A2 (Open Space) of the Camden Local Plan 2017 and policy 16 of the Fortune Green and West Hampstead Neighbourhood Plan 2015. \r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed development, in the absence of suitable mitigation against ball strikes from the Hampstead Cricket Club, would be at risk of damage and as such would detrimentally impact on the ability of users to play cricket within the designated open space, contrary to policy A2 (Open Space) of the Camden Local Plan 2017 and policy 16 (Open Green Space) of the Fortune Green and West Hampstead Neighbourhood Plan 2015.  ",
    "Reason : 4 - The applicant has failed to demonstrate that the proposed development would optimise resources and energy use in comparison with the existing building and adequately justify the need for active cooling by reducing and mitigating the impact of dwelling overheating through the application of the cooling hierarchy, thereby failing to minimise carbon dioxide emissions, contrary to policies CC1 (Climate change mitigation) and CC2 (Climate change adaptation measures) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017 and policy 1 (Housing) of the Fortune Green and West Hampstead Neighbourhood Plan 2015.\r\n",
    "Reason : 5 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement to prevent the prospective owners from applying for a residents on-street parking permit would be likely to contribute unacceptably to parking stress and congestion in the surrounding area, contrary to policies T2 (Parking and car-free development) of the Camden Local Plan 2017 and policy 7 (Sustainable Transport) of the Fortune Green and West Hampstead Neighbourhood Plan 2015.\r\n",
    "Reason : 6 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement securing a construction management plan, would be likely to give rise to conflicts with other road users and be detrimental to the amenities of the area generally, contrary to to policy T4 (Sustainable movement of good and materials)  of the Camden Local Plan 2017.  \r\n"
