    "Reason : 1 - The proposal, by representing piecemeal development, prejudices the comprehensive redevelopment of the area and fails to promote the most efficient use of land, including the provision of a mix of land uses and supporting infrastructure, contrary to policies G1 (Delivery and location of growth), E1 (Economic development) and H1 (Maximising housing supply) of the Camden Local Plan 2017 and policies SP2 (Kentish Town Potential Development Area) and SP2a (KTPDA - General Development Criteria)  of the Kentish Town Neighbourhood Plan 2018.",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed development, by reason of its height, mass, footprint and detailed design, would fail to make the best use of its site or respect the design aspirations for the Regis Road Growth Area, contrary to policies G1 (Delivery and location of growth) and D1 (Design) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017 and policies D3 (Design principles) and SP2a (KTPDA - General Development Criteria) of the Kentish Town Neighbourhood Plan 2018.",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed development, in the absence of a condition and feasibility study and options appraisal, has failed to demonstrate that the proposed substantial demolition is justified contrary to policy CC1 (Climate change mitigation) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017 and policies SI2 (Minimising greenhouse gas emissions) and SI7 (Reducing waste and supporting the circular economy) of the London Plan 2021.",
    "Reason : 4 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement to secure the details set out on the sustainability and energy plans and a BREEAM pre-assessment would be likely to contribute to climate change, contrary to policies CC1 (Climate change mitigation), CC2 (Adapting to climate change), CC3 (Water and flooding), CC4 (Air quality) and DM1 (Delivery and monitoring of the London Borough of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017 and policy SP2a of the Kentish Town Neighbourhood Plan 2018. \r\n",
    "Reason : 5 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement to secure a car-free development, would be likely to contribute unacceptably to parking stress, environmental impacts and congestion in the surrounding area, contrary to policies T1 (Prioritising walking, cycling and public transport), T2 (Parking and car-free development), CC1 (Climate change mitigation) and DM1 (Delivery and monitoring) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017 and policy SP2a (KTPDA - General Development Criteria) of the Kentish Town Neighbourhood Plan 2018.\r\n",
    "Reason : 6 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement to secure a Construction Management Plan, construction impact bond and a financial contribution for construction management plan monitoring, would be likely to give rise to conflicts with other road users and be detrimental to the amenities of the area generally, contrary to policies G1 (Delivery and location of growth), A1 (Managing the impact of development), T3 (Transport Infrastructure), T4 (Sustainable movement of goods and materials), DM1 (Delivery and monitoring), A4 (Noise and Vibration) and CC4 (Air quality) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n",
    "Reason : 7 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement securing a carbon off-set contribution, would fail to meet the requirement for zero carbon, contrary to policies CC1 (Climate change mitigation), CC2 (Adapting to climate change) and DM1 (Delivery and monitoring) of the London Borough of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n",
    "Reason : 8 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement for a Local Level Travel Plan and financial contributions for the associated monitoring, would be likely to give rise to conflicts with other road users and be detrimental to the amenities of the area generally, contrary to policies G1 (Delivery and location of growth), A1 (Managing the impact of development), T3 (Transport Infrastructure), DM1 (Delivery and monitoring), A4 (Noise and Vibration) and CC4 (Air quality) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n",
    "Reason : 9 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement securing a local employment and training package including an appropriate financial contribution, would fail to support employment opportunities for local residents and contribute to the regeneration of the area,  contrary to policies G1 (Delivery and location of growth), E1 (Economic development) and DM1 (Delivery and monitoring) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n",
    "Reason : 10 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement securing affordable workspace for SMEs, would fail to provide a range of premises for businesses to support Camden's economy, contrary to policies G1 (Delivery and location of growth), E1 (Economic development), E2 (Employment premises and sites) and DM1 (Delivery and monitoring) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017."
