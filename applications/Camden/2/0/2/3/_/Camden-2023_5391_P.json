  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development, by virtue of its height, mass, scale and architectural design, would be detrimental to the character and appearance of the host building, the quality of the townscape and the visual amenity of neighbouring occupiers.  It would therefore be contrary to policy D1 (Design) of the Camden Local Plan 2017 and policy D3 of the Kentish Town Neighbourhood Plan.  It would also be contrary to the London Plan 2021 and NPPF 2023. \r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed development, due to its height, massing, scale and location, would result in a material loss of outlook as well as having an overbearing impact and an increased sense of enclosure on the occupiers at 55-57 Holmes Road.  It would therefore be contrary to policy A1 (Managing the impact of development) of the Camden Local Plan 2017.  It would also be contrary to the London Plan 2021 and the NPPF 2023. \r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed development, by way of the absence of 8 additional cycle parking spaces, fails to include sufficient facilities to promote the use of sustainable transport and reduced car use.  As such it is contrary to policies T1, CC1 and CC2 of the Camden Local Plan 2017, the London Plan 2021 and the NPPF 2023. ",
    "Reason : 4 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement securing a student management plan, would fail to protect the amenity of neighbouring occupiers and users of the surrounding area.  It would therefore be contrary to policies A1 and H9 of the Camden Local Plan 2017.  It would also be contrary to the London Plan 2012 and the NPPF 2023. \r\n",
    "Reason : 5 - In the absence of a legal agreement to secure a contribution of �11,000 towards pedestrian, cycling and environmental improvements, the proposal is contrary to policy T3 (Transport Infrastructure) of the Camden Local Plan 2017.  It is also contrary to the London Plan 2021 and NPPF 2023.\r\n",
    "Reason : 6 - In the absence of a legal agreement to secure a contribution of �504,900 to affordable student housing the proposal fails to make a commensurate contribution to the provision of affordable student housing.  It is therefore contrary to policy H9 (Student Housing) of the Camden Local Plan 2017, London Plan 2021 and NPPF 2023.\r\n",
    "Reason : 7 - In the absence of a legal agreement including the prevention of future occupiers from obtaining on-street car parking permits, the proposal is contrary to policy T2 (Parking and car-free development) of the Camden Local Plan 2017.  It is also contrary to the London Plan 2021 and NPPF 2023.\r\n",
    "Reason : 8 - In the absence of a legal agreement to secure a Student Travel Plan and associated Monitoring and Measures Contribution of �5,196, the proposal is contrary to Local Plan policy T1 (Prioritising walking, cycling and public transport) and T3 (Transport Infrastructure) of the Camden Local Plan 2017, London Plan 2021 and NPPF 2023.\r\n",
    "Reason : 9 - In the absence of a legal agreement to secure the implementation of the Student Pick Up and Drop-Off Management, the proposal is contrary to Local Plan policy T2 (Parking and car free development) of the Camden Local Plan 2017, London Plan 2021 and NPPF 2023.\r\n",
    "Reason : 10 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement to secure a contribution of �14,850 for public open space, would be likely to contribute to pressure and demand on the existing open space in this area. The proposal is therefore contrary to policy A2 (Open Space) of the Camden Local Plan 2017 and policy GO1 (Local Green Spaces) of the Kentish Town Neighbourhood Plan. \r\n",
    "Reason : 11 - In the absence of a legal agreement to secure the implementation of a CMP, associated Implementation Support Contribution of �4,194 and Impact Bond of �8,000, the proposal is contrary to Local Plan policies A1, T3 and T4 of the Camden Local Plan 2017, London Plan 2021 and NPPF 2023.\r\n"
