    "Reason : 1 - The proposed first and second floor rear extension, due to its height, depth and architectural design would be an overbearing feature which would result in a significant loss of outlook and an unacceptable sense of enclosure from the first floor private terrace and upper floor rear windows of 529A Finchley Road, contrary to policies A1 (Managing the impact of development) and D1 (Design) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017, policy 2 (Design & Character) of the Fortune Green and West Hampstead Neighbourhood Plan 2015, the London Plan 2021 and the NPPF 2023\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed development would reduce the functionality of the existing employment use thereby resulting in harm to the vitality and viability of the shopping parade. The proposal would adversely affect the range of shops and other suitable uses to provide variety, vitality and choice and it would therefore be contrary to policy TC2 (Camden's centres and other shopping areas) of the Camden Local Plan 2017, policy 12 (Business, Commercial and Employment Premises and Sites) of the Fortune Green and West Hampstead Neighbourhood Plan 2015, the London Plan 2021 and the NPPF 2023.\r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - Due to a lack of information to show how the units would be accessible and adaptable (i.e. M4 (2) compliant) with 10% wheelchair user dwellings (i.e. M4(3) compliant), the proposal would be contrary to policy H6 (Housing choice and mix) of the Camden Local Plan 2017, policy 1 (Housing) of the Fortune Green and West Hampstead Neighbourhood Plan 2015, the London Plan 2021 and the NPPF 2023.\r\n",
    "Reason : 4 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement to secure an affordable housing contribution of (ï¿½14,800), would fail to maximise the supply of affordable housing in the borough and help meet the needs of households unable to access market housing, contrary to policy H4 (Maximising the supply of affordable housing) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017, policy 1 (Housing) of the Fortune Green and West Hampstead Neighbourhood Plan 2015, the London Plan 2021 and the NPPF 2023\r\n",
    "Reason : 5 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement to secure a car- free development, would be likely to contribute to an unacceptable increase in parking stress and congestion in the surrounding area, contrary to policies T1 (Prioritising walking, cycling, and public transport) and T2 (Parking and car-free development) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan  2017, policy 7 (Sustainable Transport) of the Fortune Green and West Hampstead Neighbourhood Plan 2015, the London Plan 2021 and the NPPF 2023\r\n"
