    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development involves the loss of an existing viable business use contrary to policy E2 (Employment premises and sites) of the Camden Local Plan 2017 and policy SW1 (Supporting small business)  of the Kentish Town Neighbourhood Plan 2015.\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed development, by reason of its height, form, design, location and prominence, would fail to respect the surrounding pattern of development and introduce an incongruous building type into the streetscene, to the detriment of the character and appearance of the host building and neighbouring buildings contrary to policy D1 (Design) of the Camden Local Plan 2017 and policy D3 (Design principles) of the Kentish Town Neighbourhood Plan 2015.\r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed development, by reason of its height and location, and in the absence of a daylight and sunlight assessment, has not satisfactorily demonstrated that the proposed extension would not bring about unacceptable loss of light and outlook to residential windows serving no.127 Castlehaven Road contrary to policy A1 of the Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n",
    "Reason : 4 - The proposed development would provide an undersized residential unit with poor levels of daylight and outlook to the detriment of future occupiers, contrary to policies D1 (Design) and H6 (Housing choice) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n",
    "Reason : 5 - The proposed development, in the absence of an energy and sustainability statement, fails to demonstrate compliance with the relevant carbon reduction targets or incorporate sustainable design and construction measures, contrary to policies CC1 (Climate change mitigation) and CC2 (Adapting to climate change) of the Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n",
    "Reason : 6 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement securing car-free housing, would be likely to contribute unacceptably to parking stress and congestion in the surrounding area and fail to promote more sustainable and efficient forms of transport and active lifestyles, contrary to policies T2 (Parking and car-free development) and DM1 (Delivery and monitoring) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n\r\n",
    "Reason : 7 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement securing a Construction Management Plan (CMP) and associated contributions to support the implementation of the CMP, would be likely to give rise to conflicts with other road users and be detrimental to the amenities of the area generally, contrary to policies A1 (Managing the impact of development), T4 (Sustainable movement of goods and materials) and DM1 (Delivery and monitoring) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n"
