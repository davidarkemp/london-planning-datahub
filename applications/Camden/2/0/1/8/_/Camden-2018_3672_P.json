    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development comprising five dwellinghouses would, by virtue of its scale, layout, visibility and location on designated open space, fail to protect the open character, amenity and ecological value of the site and the openness and character of the adjacent Hampstead Heath, resulting in harm to the amenity value of the Fitzroy Open Space, the character and appearance of the Highgate Conservation Area and the setting of Hampstead Heath. This would be contrary to policies A2 (Open Space), A3 (Biodiversity) and D2 (Heritage) of the Camden Local Plan 2017 and policies OS1 (Highgate's Major Open Spaces), OS4 (Biodiversity and Highgate's Green Grid), DH2 (Development Proposals in Highgate's Conservation Areas) and DH10 (Garden land and Backland Development) of the Highgate Neighbourhood Plan 2017.\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement to secure a  contribution to affordable housing, would fail to maximise the contribution of the site to the supply of affordable housing in the borough, contrary to policy H4 (Maximising the supply of affordable housing) of the Camden Local Plan 2017 and policy SC1 ( Highgateï¿½s Housing Needs) of the Highgate Neighbourhood Plan 2017.",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement securing a Construction Management Plan (CMP) and associated contributions to support the implementation of the CMP, would be likely to give rise to conflicts with other road users and be detrimental to the amenities of the area generally, contrary to policies A1 (Managing the impact of development), T4 (Sustainable movement of goods and materials) and DM1 (Delivery and monitoring) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017 and policy TR1 (Promoting Sustainable Movement ) of the Highgate Neighbourhood Plan 2017.\r\n",
    "Reason : 4 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement securing car-free housing, would be likely to contribute unacceptably to parking stress and congestion in the surrounding area and fail to promote more sustainable and efficient forms of transport and active lifestyles, contrary to policies T2 (Parking and car-free development) and DM1 (Delivery and monitoring) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017 and policies TR2 (Movement of Heavy Goods Vehicles) and TR4 (Reducing the Negative Impact of Parking in Highgate) of the Highgate Neighbourhood Plan 2017.\r\n",
    "Reason : 5 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement securing necessary highway works, would fail to secure adequate provision for and safety of pedestrians, cyclists and vehicles, contrary to policies A1 (Managing the impact of development), T1 (Prioritising walking, cycling and public transport) and DM1 (Delivery and monitoring) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017."
