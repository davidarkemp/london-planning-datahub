    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development, by virtue of its siting, scale, materials and detailed design, would appear as an incongruous addition to the host building and the surrounding area within which it is located failing to respect its character and integrity. Furthermore the development would fail to preserve and enhance the character of the surrounding conservation area and cause harm to the setting of the Grade II Listed Buildings at no.8-10 Ivor Street. The development is contrary to Policies D1 & D2 of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017, the London Plan 2016, and the National Planning Policy Framework 2012.",
    "Reason : 2 - Insufficient cycle storage space for 2 bicycles has been provided within the site and the proposal would therefore fail to provide a secure, convenient and high quality facility for all types of bicycles, contrary to policy T1 (Prioritising walking, cycling and public transport) of the Camden Local Plan 2017.",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement securing car-free housing, would be likely to contribute unacceptably to parking stress and congestion in the surrounding area, contrary to Policy T2 of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.",
    "Reason : 4 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement to secure a construction and demolition management plan and an appropriate financial contribution towards implementation support, would be likely to give rise to conflicts with other road users and be detrimental to the amenities of the area generally, contrary to policies G1 (Delivery and location of growth), A1 (Managing the impact of development), T3 (Transport Infrastructure), T4 (Sustainable movement of goods and materials), DM1 (Delivery and monitoring), A4 (Noise and Vibration) and CC4 (Air quality) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017."
