  "decision_conditions": [
    "Condition : 1 - The development hereby permitted must be begun not later than the end of three years from the date of this permission.\r\n\r\nReason: In order to comply with the provisions of Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended).\r\n",
    "Condition : 2 - All new external work shall be carried out in materials that resemble, as closely as possible, in colour and texture those of the existing building, unless otherwise specified in the approved application.\r\n\r\nReason: To safeguard the appearance of the premises and the character of the immediate area in accordance with the requirements of policy CS14 of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Core Strategy and policies DP24 and DP25 of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Development Policies.\r\n",
    "Condition : 3 - The development hereby permitted shall be carried out in accordance with the following approved plans: \r\n\r\nHeritage Statement August 2016, FHA670PL001 Revision P2, FHA670PL002 Revision P2, Ecological Appraisal August 2016, Planning Statement August 2016, Design and Access Statement Ref. 0004515 041, 4515041.01, 4515041.03, 4515041.05, 4515041.07, 4515041.08, 4515041.02 Revision B, 4515041.04 Revision B, 4515041.06 Revision A, 4515041.09 Revision A, 4515041.10 Revision A and SP01.\r\n\r\nReason: For the avoidance of doubt and in the interest of proper planning. \r\n",
    "Condition : 4 - A precautionary approach to working methods must be implemented, in line with recommendations set out in the Ecological Appraisal.  Any features of the building such as tiled sections, soffits, cladding which may support roosting bats, are to be removed or replaced, this should be done carefully by hand under the supervision of a qualified ecologist. All site operatives must be made aware of the possible presence of protected species during works. If any protected species or signs of protected species are found, works should stop immediately and an ecologist should be contacted, and the Local Planning Authority notified.  The applicant may need to apply for a protected species licence from Natural England, evidence of which should be submitted to the Local Authority.   \r\n\r\nReason: To mitigate potential impacts on bats and other protected species.  To ensure compliance with the Conservation of Habitats and Species Regulations 2010 and the Wildlife & Countryside Act 1981 (as amended)\r\n",
    "Condition : 5 - If more than 1 year passes between the most recent bat survey and the commencement of works, an updated bat survey must be undertaken by a licensed bat worker.  Evidence that the survey has been undertaken, and the results, shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority prior to the commencement of works.\r\n\r\nReason: To ensure compliance with the Conservation of Habitats and Species Regulations 2010 and the Wildlife & Countryside Act 1981 (as amended).\r\n",
    "Condition : 6 - Prior to commencement of development, full details of a lighting plan or statement shall be submitted to and agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority.  This shall include information about potential light spill on to buildings, trees, lines of vegetation and bat boxes.  The lighting plan should demonstrate how it seeks to minimise impact on bats by maintaining dark areas and corridors along boundary features.\r\n \r\nReason: To limit the impact of light pollution from artificial light on local amenity, intrinsically dark landscapes and nature conservation, in line with paragraph 125 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2012) and in compliance with the Habitats Regulations and the Wildlife & Countryside Act 1981 (as amended).\r\n \r\n",
    "Condition : 7 - Details of species nesting boxes or bricks shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority prior to any superstructure works commencing on site, in line with the recommedations set out in the Ecological Appraisal.  Details shall include the exact location, height, aspect, specification and indication of species to be accommodated. Boxes shall be installed in accordance with the approved plans prior to the first occupation of the development and thereafter maintained.  \r\n\r\nReason: To ensure the development provides the appropriate provision towards creation of habitats and valuable areas for biodiversity in accordance with policy 7.19 of the London Plan 2011 and Policy CS15 of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Core Strategy\r\n",
    "Condition : 8 - All building works and removal of trees, hedgerows, shrubs, scrub or tall herbaceous vegetation shall be undertaken between September and February inclusive. If this is not possible then a suitably qualified ecologist shall check the areas concerned immediately prior to the clearance works to ensure that no nesting or nest-building birds are present.  If any nesting birds are present then they are to be protected by establishing an exclusion zone around the nest, otherwise the vegetation shall not be removed until the fledglings have left the nest.  \r\n\r\nReason: All wild birds, their nests and young are protected during the nesting period under The Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 (as amended).\r\n"
