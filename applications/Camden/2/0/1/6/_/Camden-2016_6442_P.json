    "Condition : 1 - The use as an escape room hereby permitted shall be for a temporary period of twelve months from the date of this permission or the period during which the premises are occupied by Escape Plan Ltd. whichever is shorter. At the end of this period the site shall revert to a storage unit.  \r\n \r\nReason: To safeguard the amenities of the adjoining premises and the area \r\ngenerally in accordance with the requirements of policies CS5 and CS7 of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Core Strategy, policies DP26 and DP12 of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Development Policies and policy A1 of the Camden Local Plan Draft Submission 2016. ",
    "Condition : 2 - The development hereby permitted shall be carried out in accordance with the following approved plan: 16/35/01, 100-01, operational management plan.\r\n\r\n\r\nReason: For the avoidance of doubt and in the interest of proper planning.\r\n",
    "Condition : 3 - The use hereby permitted shall not be carried out outside the following times 09.00 - 22.00 Mondays - Saturdays. \r\n\r\nReason: To safeguard the amenities of the adjoining premises and the area generally in accordance with the requirements of policies CS5 and CS7 of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Core Strategy and policy DP26, DP28 of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Development Policies and policies A1 and TC4 of the Camden Local Plan Draft Submission 2016. \r\n",
    "Condition : 4 - Prior to commencement of the development details of the sound insulation of the floor/ ceiling/ walls separating the commercial part of the premises from dwellings shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority.  Details shall demonstrate that the sound insulation value DnT,w is enhanced by at least 10dB above the Building Regulations value and, where necessary, additional mitigation measures are implemented  to contain commercial noise within the commercial premises and to achieve the noise criteria of BS8233:2014 within noise sensitive premises.  Approved details shall be implemented prior to use of the development and permanently retained thereafter. \r\n\r\nReason: To safeguard the amenities of the adjoining premises and the area generally in accordance with the requirements of policies CS5 and CS7 of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Core Strategy and policy DP26, DP28 of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Development Policies and policies A1 and TC4 of the Camden Local Plan Draft Submission 2016. \r\n\r\n",
    "Condition : 5 - Prior to the occupation of the site details of a Operational Management Plan for the proposed use and opening hours shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority. The plan will demonstrate how customers arriving and vacating the premises each day will be managed and levels of noise emanating from the site mitigated. \r\n\r\nThe development shall be undertaken in accordance with the approved Operational Management Plan thereafter.\r\n\r\nReason: To safeguard the amenities of neighbouring residents and the area generally in accordance with the requirements of policy CS5 of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Core Strategy and policies DP26 and DP28 of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Development Policies and policies A1 and TC4 of the Camden Local Plan Draft Submission 2016. \r\n",
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed change of use, by virtue of its location, would harm local residential amenity through noise disturbances contrary to policy CS5, CS7 of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Core strategy and policies DP12 and DP26 of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Development Policies. \r\n\r\nThe proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement to secure the submission and implementation of an operational management plan, would be detrimental to the amenities of the area generally, contrary to policies CS5, and CS19 of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Core Strategy; and policy DP26 of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Development Policies.  \r\n\r\nWithout prejudice to any future application or appeal, the applicant is advised that reason for refusal No. 2 could be overcome by entering into a S106 legal agreement with the Council for a scheme that was in all other respects acceptable.\r\n"
