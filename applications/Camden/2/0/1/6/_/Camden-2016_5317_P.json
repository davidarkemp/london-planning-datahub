    "Reason : 2 - The proposed development, by virtue of its height, location and bulk would cause an unacceptable loss of daylight, sunlight and outlook to neighbouring residential occupiers contrary to policy CS5 (Managing the Impact of Growth and Development) of the London Borough of the Camden Local Development Framework Core Strategy and policy DP26 (Managing the Impact of Development on Occupiers and Neighbours) of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Development Policies.\r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - The lack of cycle parking provision would discourage the ownership and use of cycles in what would be required to be a car-free development, contrary to Policy CS11 (Promoting sustainable and efficient travel) and policies DP18 (Parking standards and limiting the availability of car parking) of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Development Policies. \r\n",
    "Reason : 4 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement to secure a Construction Management Plan, would fail to secure adequate provision for and safety of pedestrians and protect their amenity, contrary to policies CS5 (Managing the impact of growth and development) of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Core Strategy and policies DP20 (Movement of goods and materials), DP21 (Development connecting to highway network) and DP26 (Managing the impact of development on occupiers and neighbours) of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Development Policies.\r\n",
    "Reason : 5 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement to secure car-free housing for the residential units would be likely to contribute unacceptably to parking stress and congestion in the surrounding area, contrary to policies CS11 (Promoting sustainable and efficient travel) and CS19 (Delivering and monitoring the Core Strategy) of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Core Strategy and policy DP18 (Parking standards and the availability of car parking) of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Development Policies.\r\n"
