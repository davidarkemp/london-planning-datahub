    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development, by reason of its siting, design, massing, scale and materials, would be detrimental to the character of the host building and the surrounding streetscene, failing to preserve or enhance the character and appearance of the surrounding conservation area, contrary to policy CS14 (Promoting high quality places and conserving our heritage) of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Core Strategy and policies DP24 (Securing high quality design) and DP25 (Conserving Camden's heritage) of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Development Policies.\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed development, by reason of its siting, design, massing, scale and materials would be detrimental to the character, appearance and setting of the neighbouring Grade II listed building at 148 Haverstock Hill. The proposed development fails to respect the special historic and architectural interest of the Grade II listed building contrary to Policy CS14 (Promoting high quality places and conserving our heritage) of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Core Strategy; and Policy DP25 (Conserving Camden's heritage) of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Development Policies.\r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed development, by reason of its design, layout and associated deep floor plan would result in an unacceptable standard of accommodation for future occupants by way of a substandard unit and bedroom size and poor daylight and outlook for the kitchen, contrary to policies CS5 (Managing the impact of growth and development) of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Core Strategy and policy DP26 (Managing the impact of development on occupiers and neighbours) of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Development Policies.",

    "Reason : 5 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement securing a sustainability plan, would not secure the appropriate energy and resource efficiency measures, contrary to policies CS13 (Tackling climate change through promoting higher environmental standards) and CS16 (Improving Camden's health and well-being) of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Core Strategy and policies DP22 (Promoting sustainable design and construction) and DP23 (Water) of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Development Policies.\r\n",
    "Reason : 6 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement securing car-free housing, would be likely to contribute unacceptably to parking stress and congestion in the surrounding area, contrary to policies CS11 (Promoting sustainable and efficient travel) and CS19 (Delivering and monitoring the Core Strategy) of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Core Strategy and policies DP18 (Parking standards and the availability of car parking) and DP19 (Managing the impact of parking) of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Development Policies.\r\n",
