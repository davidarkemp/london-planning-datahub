    "Reason : 1 - The proposed front projecting infill and canopy and rear upper level extension, by reason of their poor design, siting and scale, would result in incongruous additions to the dwellinghouse that would lead to a loss of uniformity on the largely unimpaired building group of semi-detached pairs (11A-F Arkwright Road), to the detriment of the character and appearance of the host and surrounding buildings along with the Redington Frognal Conservation Area. Thus, the proposal would be contrary to policies CS5 (Managing the impact of growth and development) and CS14 (Promoting high quality places and conserving our heritage) of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Core Strategy and policies DP24 (Securing high quality design) and DP25 (Conserving Camden's heritage) of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Development Policies.\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed rear extension, by reason of its height, depth and location at high level along the shared boundary of an adjacent roof terrace, would have an unneighbourly impact on the living conditions of the adjacent occupiers at 11E Arkwright Road by way of a loss of outlook, an increased sense of enclosure and overbearing effect. Thus, the proposal would be contrary to policy CS5 (Managing the impact of growth and development) of Camden Local Development Framework Core Strategy and policy DP26 (Managing the impact of development on occupiers and neighbours) of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Development Policies.\r\n"
