    "Condition : 2 - Notwithstanding the provisions of Class D1 of the Schedule of the Town and\r\nCountry Planning (Use Classes) Order, 1987, or any provision equivalent to that Class in any statutory instrument revoking and re-enacting that Order, the premises shall only be used as a non-residential education and training centre for children predominantly aged 0-12 years and associated activities, and for no other purpose.\r\n \r\nReason: To ensure that the future occupation of the building does not adversely affect the adjoining premises/immediate area by reason of noise, traffic congestion and excessive on-street parking pressure and ensure that the link between the use of the building and the adjacent private open space is maintained in accordance with policies CS1 (Distribution of growth), CS5 (Managing the impact of growth and development), CS10 (Supporting community facilities and services), CS11 (Promoting sustainable and efficient travel) and CS15 (Protecting and improving our parks and open spaces and encouraging biodiversity) of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Core Strategy; and policies DP15 (Community and leisure uses) and DP19 (Managing the impact of parking), DP26 (Managing the impact of development on occupiers and neighbours) and DP28 (Noise and vibration) of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Development Policies.\r\n",
    "Condition : 3 - All hard and soft landscaping works shall be carried out to a reasonable standard in accordance with the landscape details hereby approved by not later than the end of the planting season following completion of the development or any phase of the development, whichever is the sooner. Any trees or areas of planting which, within a period of 5 years from the completion of the development, die, are removed or become seriously damaged or diseased, shall be replaced as soon as is reasonably possible and, in any case, by not later than the end of the following planting season, with others of similar size and species, unless the Council gives written consent to any variation.\r\n\r\nReason: To ensure that the landscaping is carried out within a reasonable period and to maintain a satisfactory standard of visual amenity in the scheme in accordance with the requirements of policies CS14 (Promoting high quality places and conserving our heritage) and CS15 (Protecting and improving our parks and open spaces and encouraging biodiversity) of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Core Strategy and policy DP24 (Securing high quality design) of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Development Policies.\r\n",

    "Condition : 5 - Prior to the first full occupation of the building hereby approved, a plan showing details of bird and bat box locations shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority. The boxes shall be installed in accordance with the approved plans prior to the first full occupation of the development and thereafter retained and maintained, unless prior written permission is given by the local planning authority.\r\n\r\nReason: In order to secure appropriate features to conserve and enhance wildlife habitats and biodiversity measures within the development, in accordance with the requirements of policy CS15 (Protecting and improving our parks and open spaces and encouraging biodiversity) of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Core Strategy.\r\n",
    "Condition : 6 - The roof areas of the building hereby approved shall not be used as roof terraces, and any access out onto these areas shall be for maintenance of the roofs only and for no other purpose.\r\n\r\nReason: In order to prevent unreasonable overlooking of the neighbouring premises in accordance with the requirement of policies CS1 (Distribution of growth) and CS5 (Managing the impact of growth and development) of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Core Strategy; and policy DP26 (Managing the impact of development on occupiers and neighbours) of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Development Policies.\r\n",
    "Condition : 7 - The development hereby permitted shall be carried out in accordance with the following approved plans 3212/PL 20; 3212/PL 22 Rev A; 3212/PL 23 Rev A; 3212/PL 24; 3212/PL 25 Rev A; 3212/PL 26; 3212/PL 27; 3212/PL 29; 3212/PL 30; 3212/PL 34; Bauder Technical Data Sheet, Section & Maintenance Procedure.                                      \r\n\r\nReason: For the avoidance of doubt and in the interest of proper planning.\r\n"
