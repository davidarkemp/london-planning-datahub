    "Reason : 1 - The proposed rear extension by reason of its height and bulk would fail to appear subordinate to the host building and terrace of which it is a part and would thus appear excessively dominant and overbearing to the detriment of the visual amenity of the properties to the rear contrary to policies D1 (Design) and D2 (Heritage) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement to secure a Construction Management Plan (and associated support contribution), would fail to ensure that the development can be implemented without causing detrimental impact to residential amenity or the safe and efficient operation of the highway network in the local area, contrary to policies A1 and T4 of the Camden Local Plan 2017. \r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement to secure it as car-free, would be likely to contribute unacceptably to parking stress and congestion in the surrounding area and fail to promote more healthy or sustainable transport choices, contrary to policy T2 (Parking and car-free development) of the Camden Local Plan 2017. \r\n",
    "Reason : 4 - In the absence of a legal agreement to secure a highways and street works contribution, the proposed development would fail to repair any potential construction damage to transport infrastructure, contrary to policy Camden Planning Guidance Transport and T1 (Prioritising Walking, cycling and public transport) of the Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n"
