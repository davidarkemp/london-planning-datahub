    "Reason : 2 - The proposed advertisement, by virtue of its location, scale, prominence, and method of illumination, would introduce a distraction to traffic and pedestrians and obscure visibility of the traffic signals or any road signs near the junction with Stephen Street, causing harm to highway and public safety, contrary to TfL guidance, and to Local Plan Policies A1 (Managing the Impact of Development), D4 (Advertisements) and T1 (Prioritising walking, cycling and public transport). \r\n"
