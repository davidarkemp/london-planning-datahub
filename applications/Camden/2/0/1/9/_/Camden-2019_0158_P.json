The proposal is therefore contrary to policies D1 and D2 of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement for car-free housing, would be likely to contribute unacceptably to parking stress and congestion in the surrounding area, contrary to policies T1 (Prioritising walking, cycling and public transport), T2 (Parking and Car Parking) and A1 (Managing the impact of development) and DM1 (Delivery and monitoring) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.
