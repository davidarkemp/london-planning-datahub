  "description": "Installation of 1x telephone kiosk on the pavement.\r\n",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed telephone kiosk, by reason of its location and size, and lack of evidence to justify the need for an additional kiosk in this location, would add to visual clutter and detract from the character and appearance of the streetscene and setting of the adjacent and nearby locally listed buildings, contrary to policy D3 of the Kentish Town Neighbourhood Plan 2016, and policies D1 (Design) and D2 (Heritage) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed telephone kiosk, by virtue of its location, size and detailed design and lack of evidence to justify the need for an additional kiosk in this location, adding unnecessary street clutter, would reduce the amount of useable, unobstructed footway, which would be detrimental to the quality of the public realm, cause harm to highway safety and hinder pedestrian movement and have a detrimental impact on the promotion of walking as an alternative to motorised transport, contrary to policies G1 (Delivery and location of growth), A1 (Managing the impact of development), C6 (Access for all) and T1 (Prioritising walking, cycling and public transport) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - In absence of a legal agreement to secure the removal of the existing kiosks and a maintenance and management plan for the proposed kiosk, the proposal would be detrimental to the quality of the public realm, and detract from the character and appearance of the streetscene, contrary to policies D1 (Design), G1 (Delivery and location of growth), A1 (Managing the impact of development), C6 (Access for all) and T1 (Prioritising walking, cycling and public transport) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.",
