    "Condition : 4 - Prior to installation of the external plant units, details shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the Council of the external noise levels emitted from the plant and any proposed mitigation measures as appropriate such as an acoustic enclosure and anti-vibration isolators. The measures shall ensure that the external noise level emitted from plant will be lower than the lowest existing background noise level by at least 10dBA, by 15dBA where the source is tonal, as assessed according to BS4142:1997 at the nearest and/or most affected noise sensitive premises, with all machinery operating together at maximum capacity. The subsequently approved details shall be implemented in their entirety prior to use of the plant and thereafter be permanently retained.\r\n\r\nReason: To safeguard the amenities of the adjoining premises and the area generally in accordance with the requirements of policies A1 and A4 of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n",
    "Condition : 5 - Noise levels at a point 1 metre external to sensitive facades shall be at least 10dB(A) less than the existing background measurement (LA90), expressed in dB(A) when all plant/equipment (or any part of it) is in operation unless the plant/equipment hereby permitted will have a noise that has a distinguishable, discrete continuous note (whine, hiss, screech, hum) and/or if there are distinct impulses (bangs, clicks, clatters, thumps), then the noise levels from that piece of plant/equipment at any sensitive faï¿½ade shall be at least 15dB(A) below the LA90, expressed in dB(A). \r\n\r\nReason: To safeguard the amenities of the premises and the area generally in accordance with the requirements of policies A1 and A4 of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017. \r\n"
