    "Condition : 4 - Prior to the commencement of works to construct the rear extension hereby approved (other than demolition), the existing rear garden outbuilding shall be demolished and removed from site. Prior to the end of the next available planting season following construction of the rear extensions hereby approved, the rear half of the back garden shall then be relandscaped and made good. \r\n\r\nReason: To ensure that an appropriate proportion of rear garden is retained to maintain the character, visual amenity as well as biodiversity value of the area and to ensure that the development does not place additional stress upon local drainage infrastructure in accordance with the requirements of policies D1, D2, A2, A3 and CC3 of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n",
    "Condition : 5 - Before the relevant part of the work is begun, detailed drawings, or samples of materials as appropriate, in respect of the following, shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority: \r\n\r\na) Typical details including sections, plans and elevations at 1:10 of all new windows (including jambs, head and cill); \r\n\r\nb) Typical details including sections, plans and elevations at 1:20 of timber glazed panels to rear extension;\r\n\r\nc) Manufacturer's specification details / a sample of reconstituted stone facing material to the rear extension (to be submitted to the Local Planning Authority) and samples of those materials (to be provided on site);\r\n\r\nd) Manufacturer's specification details of rear rooflights, both of which are to remain 'conservation style' with flush finish and central glazing bars;\r\n\r\nThe relevant part of the works shall be carried out in accordance with the details thus approved and all approved samples shall be retained on site during the course of the works. \r\n\r\nReason:  To safeguard the appearance of the premises and the character of the immediate area in accordance with the requirements of policy D1 and D2 of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017\r\n",

The obscure glazing shall be permanently retained thereafter.  \r\n\r\nReason:  In order to prevent unacceptable overlooking of the neighbouring occupiers and to ensure that mitigation measure remains visually appropriate in accordance with the requirements of policies G1, D1, D2 and A1 of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017\r\n",
    "Condition : 7 - A) The development hereby approved shall be constructed in strict accordance with the recommendations and methodologies set out within the Arboricultural report and tree protection plans prepared by Andrew Day consultancy (dated 06.11.19 and 07.09.19 respectively). All trees on the site, or parts of trees growing from adjoining sites, unless shown on the permitted drawings as being removed, shall be retained and protected from damage in accordance with the approved protection details. \r\n\r\nB) Prior to the end of the next available planting season following construction, no.2 replacement trees shall be planted within the rear garden of the property with replanting species, position and size to be carried out in accordance with The Tree Protection Plan prepared by Andrew Day consultancy (dated 07.09.19) unless otherwise approved by the local planning authority in writing. \r\n\r\nReason: To ensure that the development will not have an adverse effect on existing trees where shown as to be retained and in order to maintain the character and amenities of the area in accordance with the requirements of policies D1, D2, A2 and A3 of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n\r\n"
