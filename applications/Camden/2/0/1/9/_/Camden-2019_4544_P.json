    "Condition : 1 - The development hereby permitted must be begun not later than the end of three years from the date of this permission.\r\n\r\nReason: In order to comply with the provisions of Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended).\r\n",
    "Condition : 2 - The development hereby permitted shall be carried out in accordance with the following approved plans:\r\nExisting plans: 548.(1).0.101 rev A; 548.(1).0.102; 548.(1).0.103; 548.(1).0.104; 548.(1).0.105 rev B; 548.(1).0.106; 548.(1).0.107.\r\nProposed plans: 548.(1).1.101 rev B; 548.(1).1.102 rev A; 548.(1).1.103 rev B; 548.(1).1.104 rev A; 1548.(1).1.05 rev B; 548(1).2.101 rev A; 548(1).3.101 rev A; 548(1).4.101; 548(1).4.102 rev A.\r\nSupporting documents: Acoustic report prepared by EMTEC dated 29th August 2019.\r\n\r\nReason: For the avoidance of doubt and in the interest of proper planning.\r\n",
    "Condition : 3 - All new external work shall be carried out in materials that resemble, as closely as possible, in colour and texture those of the existing building, unless otherwise specified in the approved application. \r\n\r\nReason: To safeguard the appearance of the premises and the character of the immediate area in accordance with the requirements of policy D1 and D2 of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017. \r\n",
    "Condition : 4 - Noise levels at a point 1 metre external to sensitive facades shall be at least 10dB(A) less than the existing background measurement (LA90), expressed in dB(A) when all plant/equipment (or any part of it) is in operation unless the plant/equipment hereby permitted will have a noise that has a distinguishable, discrete continuous note (whine, hiss, screech, hum) and/or if there are distinct impulses (bangs, clicks, clatters, thumps), then the noise levels from that piece of plant/equipment at any sensitive faï¿½ade shall be at least 15dB(A) below the LA90, expressed in dB(A). \r\n\r\nReason: To safeguard the amenities of the adjoining premises and the area generally in accordance with the requirements of policies D1, A1 and A4 of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017. \r\n",
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed air conditioning unit by reason of its size, location and design would be visually harmful to the character and appearance of the historic building and to the wider Charlotte Street Conservation Area contrary to policies D1 (Design) and D2 (Heritage) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - In the absence of evidence to the contrary the proposal would fail to follow the cooling hierarchy thereby introducing inappropriate climate change adaptation measures contrary to policy CC3 (Adapting to Climate Change) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n"
