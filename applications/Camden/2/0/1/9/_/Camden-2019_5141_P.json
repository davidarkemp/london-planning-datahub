    "Reason : 1 - The proposed basement side extension and front lightwell, by virtue reason of the detailed design, height, massing, materials and siting, would have a detrimental impact on the character and appearance ofn the grade II listed host building, the listed terrace and the Hampstead Conservation Area, contrary to policies D1 (Design) and D2 (Heritage) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017 and policy DH1 (Design) and DH2 (Conservation areas and listed buildings) of the Hampstead Neighbourhood Plan 2018. \r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed entrance gates, by reason of their material and detailed design, would appear incongruous, reducing the open character of the front garden and so would result in harm to the character and appearance of the grade II listed host building, the listed terrace and the Hampstead Conservation Area, contrary to policies D1 (Design) and D2 (Heritage) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017 and policy DH1 (Design) and DH2 (Conservation areas and listed buildings) of the Hampstead Neighbourhood Plan 2018. \r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - In the absence of an independent audit of the basement impact assessment, the applicant has failed to demonstrate the development would not cause harm to the built and natural environment including the local water environment, ground conditions and the structural stability of the listed building and neighbouring properties contrary to policy A5 (Basements) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan (2017) and policy BA1 (Local requirements for Basement Impact Assessments) of the Hampstead Neighbourhood Plan 2018.\r\n",
    "Reason : 4 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement to secure a construction management plan, would be likely to contribute unacceptably to traffic disruption and be detrimental to general highway and pedestrian safety, and neighbouring amenity including air quality contrary to policies A1 (Managing the impact of development), T4 (Sustainable movement of goods and materials), DM1 (Delivery and monitoring), A4 (Noise and Vibration) and CC4 (Air quality) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017 and BA3 (Local Requirements for Construction Management Plans) of the Hampstead Neighbourhood Plan 2018.\r\n",
    "Reason : 5 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement securing an Approval in Principle, would fail to mitigate the impact of the basement works on the adjacent public highway contrary to policies A1 (Managing the impact of development), T3 (Transport Infrastructure) and DM1 (Delivery and monitoring) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017. \r\n"
