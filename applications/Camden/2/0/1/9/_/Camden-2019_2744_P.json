    "Reason : 2 - The applicant has failed to demonstrate, by way of a suitably comprehensive acoustic survey and a risk-based odour control assessment, that all extraction equipment, when operating at full capacity, would be capable of doing so without causing noise disturbance and harm to the local residential environment , contrary to policies A1 (Managing the impact of development), A4 (Noise and vibration), TC2 (Camden's centres and other shopping areas) and TC4 (Town centre uses) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposal would result in an additional hot food takeaway unit (Use class A5) located close to a school and have a detrimental impact on public health, contrary to policy TC4 (Town centre uses) of the Camden Local Plan 2017, and policy E9 (Retail, markets and hot food takeaways) of the Draft London Plan (July 2019) and relevant planning guidance. \r\n"
