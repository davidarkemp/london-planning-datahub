    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development, by reason of the proposed residential use, would result in loss of employment space which supports the functioning of the Central Activity Zone (CAZ), contrary to policies E1 (Economic development) and E2 (Employment premises and sites) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed development, by reason of its layout, position within the building, and lack of window openings to enable daylight/sunlight and outlook, would not comply with relevant standards for residential use and result in poor standard of accommodation, contrary to policies A1 (Managing the impact of development), D1 (Design), H7 (Large and small homes), H10 (Housing with shared facilities) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed development, by virtue of its proposed use and site constrains which limit solar gain required for residential accommodation, has failed to minimise carbon dioxide emissions, contrary to Policy CC1 (Climate change mitigation) and CC2 (Climate change adaptation measures) of London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n",
    "Reason : 4 - The proposed development, by reason of its sub-standard cycling facilities provision would be contrary to policy T1 (Prioritising walking, cycling and public transport) of London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.",
    "Reason : 5 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement for car-free, would be likely to contribute unacceptably to parking stress and congestion in the surrounding area, contrary to polices T2 (Parking and car-free development) of London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017."
