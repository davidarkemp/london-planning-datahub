  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development by virtue of its use, location and catchment area is likely to result in an increase in trips by private motor vehicles, increased traffic congestion and excaberating air pollution and would fail to sufficiently prioritise sustainable modes of transport, contrary to policies T1 (Prioritising, walking, cycling and public transport) and C2 (Community facilities) of the Camden Local Plan 2017 and policies TT1 (Traffic volumes and vehicle size) and TT2 (Pedestrian environment) of the Hampstead Neighbourhood Plan.",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed development, by virtue of the proximity of its outdoor amenity space to neighbouring residential properties would result in an unacceptable increase in noise disturbance to the detriment of the amenity of neighbouring residents contrary to policy A1 (Managing the impact of development) of the Camden Local Plan 2017.",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed development by virtue of its location on a main road with poor air quality, which could harm the health of pupils, would not be an appropriate location for a school would not have a detrimental impact on air quality as a result of the proposal, contrary to policies A1 (Managing the impact of development) and CC4 (Air quality) of the Camden Local Plan 2017 and policy S3 of the emerging London Plan December 2017."
