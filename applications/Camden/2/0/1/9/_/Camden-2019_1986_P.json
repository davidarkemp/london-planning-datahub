  "description": "Erection of a mansard roof extension, a new two-storey rear infill extension at lower-ground floor level with first floor conservatory to the rear elevation, alterations to the floor levels including re-alignment of the rear windows of the annex wing extension and conversion of the existing 4 flats into 3 x 1 bedroom flats and 1 x 2 bedroom maisonette (Class C3).\r\n ",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed first floor conservatory, by reason of its siting, height, bulk and detailed design, would be an incongruous and bulky addition in conjunction with the approved lower floors infill extension and would result in the loss of a characteristic gap between closet wings. It would thus harm the character and appearance of the host building and the character of the locally listed terrace of buildings here, contrary to policies D1 (Design) and D2 (Heritage) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017 and policy D3 (Design Principles) of the Kentish Town Neighbourhood Plan 2016.\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement securing car-free housing, would be likely to contribute unacceptably to parking stress and congestion in the surrounding area and would fail to promote more sustainable and efficient forms of transport, contrary to policies T1 (Prioritising walking, cycling and public transport) and T2 (Car-free development and limiting the availability of parking) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017. \r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement securing a Construction Management Plan (CMP) and associated CMP Implementation Support Contribution, would be likely to give rise to conflicts with other road users, and be detrimental to the amenities of the area generally, contrary to policies A1 (Managing the impact of development) and T4 (Promoting the sustainable movement of goods and materials) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n"
