    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development, by reason of its siting, bulk, materials, design and loss of a traditional pitched roof form, would appear incongruous and would fail to respect and preserve the original design and proportions of the building and would harm the visual integrity of the group of buildings of which it is a part, harming the character and appearance of both the host building and the surrounding area. As such, the proposal is contrary to policy D1 (Design) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan (2017) and policy D3 (Design Principles) of the Kentish Town Neighbourhood Plan (2016).\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed development, by reason of its location and proximity to the second and third floor side windows and rooflights in the closet wings of Nos. 83 and 89 Burghley Road, would result in a harmful loss of privacy to these neighbouring properties, contrary to policy A1 (Managing the impact of development) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n"
