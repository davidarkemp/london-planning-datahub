    "Reason : 1 - The proposed LED digital advertising screen, by virtue of its size, scale, design, location and method of illumination, would be an incongruous and bulky feature that would introduce an illuminated fixture as well as create visual clutter at high level. This element of the proposal is considered to be an unsympathetic and unacceptable form of development that would be detrimental to the character and appearance of the streetscape and surrounding locale, contrary to policy D4 (Advertisements) of the Camden Local Plan 2017."
