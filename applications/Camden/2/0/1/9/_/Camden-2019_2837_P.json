    "Reason : 2 - The proposed second floor roof terrace would result in unacceptable loss of privacy to the occupants of nos. 29 and 4 Camden Mews, contrary to policy A1 (Amenity) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed development, in the absence of sufficient information to justify demolition over reuse, would fail to demonstrate the proposal would constitute sustainable development, contrary to policy CC1 (Climate change mitigation) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n",
    "Reason : 4 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement securing car-free development, would be likely to contribute unacceptably to parking stress and congestion in the surrounding area and fail to promote more sustainable and efficient forms of transport, contrary to policies T1 (Prioritising walking, cycling and public transport) and T2 (Car-free development and parking) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n"
