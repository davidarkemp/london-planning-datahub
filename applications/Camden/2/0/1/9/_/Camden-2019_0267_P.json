    "Reason : 1 - The proposed roof extension by reason of its height, massing, scale, design and position at roof level would be a visually prominent and incongruous addition to the building, which would not relate well to the form and architectural composition of the host building, and be out of keeping with the consistent scale of the adjacent buildings. As a result the development would harm the appearance of the host building and wider area contrary to Policy D1 of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - In the absence of a legal agreement to secure a Construction Management Plan and associated implementation support contribution, the development would fail to ensure that the development can be implemented without causing detrimental impact to residential amenity or the safe and efficient operation of the highway network in the local area. The development would therefore be contrary to policies DM1 (Delivery and monitoring), A1 (managing the impact of development) and T4 (sustainable movement of goods and materials) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n"
