    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development, by virtue of the design of the boundary treatment and the replacement of soft landscaping with a parking area, would result in the loss of green space and cause harm to the character and appearance of the host property, contrary to polcies BD4 (Design code); BGI 2 (Front boundary treatments) and SD3 (Car free development) of the Redington and Frognal Draft Neighbourhood Plan 2019. The proposal would also be  contrary to policies A2 (open space), D1 (Design) and D2 (Heritage) of Camden Local Plan 2017.",
    "Reason : 2 - In the absence of detailed measures to mitigate the loss of permeable green space, the development fails to demonstrate that it would be resilient to climate change and reduces or does not contribute to the risk of flooding, contrary to policies CC2 (Adapting to climate change) and CC3 (Water and flooding) of the Local Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed development, by virtue of the increased on-site parking provision, would fail to promote or prioritise sustainable transport or reduce car use, contrary to policies A1 (Managing the impact of development), T1 (Prioritising walking, cycling and public transport) and T2 (Parking and car-free development) of the Local Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.
