    "Reason : 1 - The proposed rear extension at first floor level, by virtue of its siting and scale, would create an incongruous, and visually intrusive addition which would fail to respect the consistent historic built form of the adjoining terrace eroding its uniformity, to the detriment of the appearance of the host building and terrace and would fail to preserve the special character of the St Johns Wood Conservation Area contrary to policies G1, D1 and D2 of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan (2017)\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed first floor rear extension, by virtue of its scale and siting, would result in an overbearing sense of enclosure to the rear habitable room windows at first floor to the adjoining nos. 124 and 128 Boundary Road, contrary to policy A1 of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan (2017) \r\n"
