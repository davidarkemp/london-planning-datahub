    "Reason : 2 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement securing a \r\nConstruction Management Plan, would be likely to give rise to conflicts with other road users and be detrimental to the amenity of the area generally, contrary to policies A1(Managing the impact of development), T4 (Sustainable movement of goods and materials) and DM1 (Delivery and monitoring) of the Camden Local Plan 2017. \r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement to secure \"car-free\" office accommodation, would be likely to contribute unacceptably to parking stress and congestion in the surrounding area, contrary to Policies T2 (Parking and car-free development) and DM1 (Delivery and monitoring) of the Camden Local Plan 2017. \r\n"
