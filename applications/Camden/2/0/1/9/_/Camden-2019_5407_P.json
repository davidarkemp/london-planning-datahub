The permanent change of use would result in the loss of employment space, contrary to policies E1 and E2 of the Camden Local Plan (2017).\r\n",
    "Condition : 2 - The development hereby permitted shall be carried out in accordance with the following approved plans: Drawing numbers: OS Plan; E6343-P Rev 8; E6406G-PR Rev A;  Chalk Farm Cold Weather Shelter Management Plan dated 20/11/2019.\r\n\r\nReason: For the avoidance of doubt and in the interest of proper planning.\r\n",
    "Condition : 3 - The management strategy of the approved temporary development shall be undertaken in accordance with the details within the Chalk Farm Cold Weather Shelter Management Plan dated 20/11/2019. The service will be staffed 24/7, with a minimum of two members of staff on site at all times. All clients will be required to book in to the shelter by 9pm each evening and there will be a no visitor's policy. \r\n\r\nReason: To safeguard amenities of adjacent premises in accordance with the requirements of policy A1 of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n\r\n"
