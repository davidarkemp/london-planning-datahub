    "Reason : 1 - The proposed loss of a retail unit (Class A1), by reason of the reduction of the total number of retail units within this parade, would harm the retail character, function, vitality and viability of the Queen's Crescent neighbourhood centre, contrary to policies TC2 (Camden's Centres and other shopping areas) and TC4 (Town centre uses) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed kitchen extraction flue, by reason of its size, location and detailed design would have a detrimental impact on the  character and appearance of the host building and the terrace in which it is located, contrary to policy D1 (Design) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed kitchen extraction flue, by reason of its size and location in relation to existing windows would cause unacceptable harm to the amenity of residential occupiers at 78 Queen's Crescent by way of loss of outlook, contrary to policy A1 (Managing the impact of development) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.",
    "Reason : 4 - The applicant has failed to demonstrate, by way of a suitably comprehensive acoustic survey  and a risk-based odour control assessment, that all extraction equipment, when operating at full capacity, would be capable of doing so without causing noise disturbance and harm to the local residential environment , contrary to policies A1 (Managing the impact of development), A4 (Noise and vibration), TC2 (Camden's centres and other shopping areas) and TC4 (Town centre uses) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017."
