    "Reason : 1 - The proposed vehicular entrance and crossover, alterations to the front boundary treatment and additional hardstanding and associated loss of planting, by virtue of their design, appearance and the alteration of an historic boundary treatment, would cause harm to the character and appearance of the application site, the street scene along Harley Road and would fail to preserve and enhance, but instead would detract from the character and appearance of the Elsworthy Conservation Area, contrary to the aims of Policies D1(Design) and D2(Heritage) of the Camden Local Plan 2017.",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposals, by virtue of the loss of garden space including mature trees, would fail to protect features of nature conservation value and would lead to increased pressure on the drainage system and increase the risk of flooding, contrary to the aims of Policies A3 (Biodiversity), CC3 (Water and Flooding) and D1 (Design) of the Camden Local Plan 2017. \r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - In the absence of an adequate Arboricultural assessment, the applicant has failed to demonstrate that the proposed development would not cause unacceptable harm to the retained Horse Chestnut tree (Tree T1), contrary to Policy A3 (Biodiversity) of the Camden Local Plan 2017. ",
    "Reason : 4 - The proposed enlarged hardstanding and additional crossover, by virtue of the increase capacity for on-site car parking would promote use of unsustainable modes of transport, contrary to the aims of Policies T2(Parking and car-free development), CC4(Air quality) and A1(Managing the impact of development) of the Camden Local Plan.
