    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development, in the absence of sufficient justification demonstrating that the premises is no longer suitable for continued business use would fail to support economic activity in Camden and result in the loss of employment opportunities within the Borough contrary to policies E1 (Economic development) and E2 (Employment premises and sites) of the Camden Local Plan (2017).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed residential unit, by reason of inadequate internal floorspace would result in sub-standard accommodation that would fail to provide an acceptable level of residential amenity to its occupants, contrary to policies A1 (Managing the impact of development) and H6 (Housing choice and mix) of the Camden Local Plan 2017.",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement for car-free housing, would be likely to contribute unacceptably to parking stress and congestion in the surrounding area, contrary to policies T1 (Prioritising walking, cycling and public transport), T2 (Parking and Car Parking) and A1 (Managing the impact of development) and DM1 (Delivery and monitoring) of the Camden Local Plan 2017."
