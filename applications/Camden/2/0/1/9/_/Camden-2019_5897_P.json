  "description": "Erection of rear roof extension including increase in height of roof ridge and installation of 4 x front facing rooflights.",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed roof extension, by virtue of its size, siting, scale, materials and design would represent an excessive, inappropriate and discordant feature on the building and in the built environment which would cause harm to the character and appearance of the area. The proposal would be contrary to policy D1 (Design) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan (2017); and policy CS DQ1 (Responding to places) of the Camley Street Neighbourhood Development Plan (2019-2034).\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed roof extension, by reason of the wrap around window, would result in direct overlooking and a loss of privacy for adjoining occupiers.  The proposal would therefore be contrary to policy A1 (Manging the impact of development) of the LB Camden Local Plan 2019 and policy CS DQ1 - Responding to places of the Camley Street Neighbourhood Development Plan (2019-2034)."
