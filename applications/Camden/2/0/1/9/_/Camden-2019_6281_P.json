  "description": "Erection of roof extension to increase roof ridge height; erection of rear dormer windows; installation of rooflights to front and rear roofslopes; erection of first floor rear addition with installation of obscure glazed windows to first floor side and rear elevations.",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed roof extension with raised ridge line, dormers and rooflights, by reason of their siting, scale, height and design, would harm the appearance and architectural integrity of the property, would harm the setting and symmetry of the three houses at nos.13A,B&C, and would harm the character and appearance of the streetscene and Hampstead Conservation Area. As such the proposal is contrary to policies D1 (Design) and D2 (Heritage) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017 and policies DH1 (Design) and DH2 (Conservation areas and listed buildings) of the Hampstead Neighbourhood Plan 2018.\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed raised roof ridge and formation of dormers, by reason of their siting, scale and proximity to neighbouring windows, would result in a loss of outlook and increased sense of enclosure to no.56 Flask Walk. As such the proposal is contrary to policy A1 (Managing the impact of development) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - In the absence of information to demonstrate otherwise, it is considered that the proposed raised roof ridge and formation of dormers, by reason of their siting, scale and proximity to neighbouring windows, would be likely to result in a harmful loss of daylight and sunlight and increased levels of light overspill to no.56 Flask Walk. As such the proposal is contrary to policy A1 (Managing the impact of development) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n"
