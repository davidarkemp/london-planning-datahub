    "Reason : 1 - The proposed loss of a retail unit would result in a under provision of retail and an overconcentration of non-retail uses within the designated frontage, to the detriment of the long term vitality and viability of the Kentish Town town centre. The works would therefore remain contrary to National Planning Policy Framework chapter 7, paragraph 85 (2019); London Borough of Camden Local Plan policy TC2 (2017) and Kentish Town Neighbourhood Plan policies SW2 and SW3 (2016).\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed change of use, in the absence of a Section 106 legal agreement to secure the residential unit as car-free, would contribute unacceptably to parking stress and traffic congestion in the surrounding area and would not promote the use of sustainable transport contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework chapter 9, paragraphs 102, 108 and 110"
