    "Reason : 2 - The proposed kitchen extraction flue, by reason of its size, location and detailed design would have a detrimental impact on the  character and appearance of the host building and the terrace in which it is located, contrary to policy D1 (Design) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017 and chapter 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2019.  \r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - The applicant has failed to demonstrate, by way of a suitably comprehensive acoustic survey  and a risk-based odour control assessment, that all extraction equipment, when operating at full capacity, would be capable of doing so without causing noise or odour disturbance and harm to the local residential environment, contrary to policies A1 (Managing the impact of development), A4 (Noise and vibration), TC2 (Camden's centres and other shopping areas) and TC4 (Town centre uses) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017, and chapter 15 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2019.  \r\n"
