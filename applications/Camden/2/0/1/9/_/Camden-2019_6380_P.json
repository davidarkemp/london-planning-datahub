    "Reason : 1 - The proposal would result in the loss of front garden space and part of the front boundary wall, which contributes to the character and appearance of the conservation area, and as such, would be harmful to the character and appearance of the streetscene and the wider Parkhill Conservation Area, contrary to policies D1 (Design) and D2 (Heritage) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The creation of an on-site parking space would promote the use of private motor vehicles and fails to encourage the use of sustainable modes of transport, as well as lead to additional parking stress through the removal of an on-street parking space, contrary to policies T1 (Prioritising walking, cycling and public transport), T2 (Parking and car free development) and A1 (Managing the impact of development) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n\r\n"
