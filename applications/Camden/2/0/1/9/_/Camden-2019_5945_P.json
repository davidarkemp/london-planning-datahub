  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development, by reason of the loss of ancillary space to serve the public house, would materially change the character and function of an existing use designated as an Asset of Community Value and compromise the long-term viability and future of the public house which provides an important local community facility, contrary to policy C4 (Public Houses) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan June 2017, paragraph 92 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2019, and Policy 4.8 of the London Plan 2016. \r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement securing car-free development, would be likely to contribute unacceptably to parking stress and congestion in the surrounding area, contrary to policy T2 (Parking and car-free development) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - The applicant has failed to demonstrate that the proposed co-location of habitable visitor accommodation and the public house would not be likely to give rise to complaints about noise and disturbance affecting the occupiers of the proposed facility that may prejudice the future operation of the public house contrary to policies A1 and A4 of the Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n"
