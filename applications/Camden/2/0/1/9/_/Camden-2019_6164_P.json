    "Reason : 1 - The proposed two storey upwards extension, by reason of its height, form, location, prominence, proportions and design would harm the pattern of historic development and introduce an incongruous building type into the streetscene, to the detriment of the character and appearance of the host building, neighbouring buildings and the Camden Broadway Conservation Area contrary to policies D1 and D2 of the Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed single rear extension, by reason of its height and depth, would fail to be a subordinate addition to the host building to the detriment of the character and appearance of the host building, neighbouring buildings and the Camden Broadway Conservation Area contrary to policies D1 and D2 of the Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - In the absence of a daylight and sunlight assessment, it has not been satisfactorily demonstrated that the proposed extensions and works of conversion would not bring about unacceptable loss of daylight and sunlight to residential windows serving no's. 128b Camden Road and 159 St Pancras Way contrary to policy A1 of the Camden Local Plan 2017.",
    "Reason : 4 - The proposed upwards extension, by virtue of its height, location and proximity to neighbouring properties, would bring about an unacceptable loss of outlook and privacy to residential windows serving no's. 128b Camden Road and 159 St Pancras Way contrary to policy A1 of the Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n",
    "Reason : 5 - The proposed window openings and works of residential conversion would bring about an unacceptable loss of privacy to 157 and 159 St Pancras Way contrary to policy A1 of the Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n",
    "Reason : 6 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement to secure car-free housing, would be likely to contribute unacceptably to parking stress and congestion in the surrounding area and fail to promote more healthy or sustainable transport choices, contrary to policy T2 (Parking and car-free development) of the Camden Local Plan 2017.",
    "Reason : 7 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement to secure a contribution to affordable housing, would fail to maximise the contribution of the site to the supply of affordable housing in the borough, contrary to policy H4 (Maximising the supply of affordable housing) of the Camden Local Plan 2017.",
    "Reason : 8 - \r\nThe proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement to secure a Construction Management Plan (and associated support contribution), would fail to ensure that the development can be implemented without causing detrimental impact to residential amenity or the safe and efficient operation of the highway network in the local area, contrary to policies A1 and T4 of the Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n"
