    "Reason : 1 - The proposed advertisement, by virtue of its location, scale, prominence, and method of illumination, would add visual clutter, detrimental to the amenity of the conservation area, settings of listed buildings opposite, and wider streetscene, contrary to policies D1 (Design), D2 (Heritage) and D4 (Advertisements) of the Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed advertisement, by virtue of its location, scale, prominence, and method of illumination, would introduce a distraction to traffic and pedestrians and obscure visibility of the traffic signals or any road signs located to the south, causing harm to highway and public safety, contrary to TfL guidance, and to Local Plan Policies A1 (Managing the Impact of Development), D4 (Advertisements) and T1 (Prioritising walking, cycling and public transport).\r\n"
