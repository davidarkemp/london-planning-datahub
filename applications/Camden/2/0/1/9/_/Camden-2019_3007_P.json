    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development, on account of its position in close proximity to residential dwellings and other food, drink and entertainment uses in the vicinity, would result in an overconcentration of food, drink and entertainment uses which would cause unacceptable harm to the character and function of the designated retail frontage and wider town centre area, and the amenities and health of neighbours and the local community, contrary to policies A1, A4, TC2 and TC4 of the Camden Local Plan (2017) and Policy SW2 and SW3 of the Kentish Town Neighbourhood Plan (2016).\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The applicant has failed to demonstrate, by way of a suitably comprehensive acoustic survey & impact assessment and a risk-based odour control & impact assessment, that all plant equipment, when operating at full capacity, would be capable of doing so without causing harm to neighbouring amenity, contrary to policies A1, A4, TC2 and TC4 of the Camden Local Plan (2017).",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed development, in the absence of plans to sufficiently demonstrate the impact of the proposed external works, would cause unacceptable harm to the character and appearance of the host building and surrounding area, contrary to Policy D1 of the Camden Local Plan (2017) and Policy D3 of the Kentish Town Neighbourhood Plan (2016)."
