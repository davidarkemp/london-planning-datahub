  "description": "Erection of a mansard roof extension to provide a 2-bedroom flat (Class C3) with terrace at third floor level and alteration to existing side dormer.",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed roof extension and associated terrace, by virtue of their location, height, bulk and design, are considered to have a detrimental impact on the overall composition of the building and the setting of its decorative features, as well as harming the uniformity of the group of buildings to which it belongs and the character and appearance of the streetscene and Redington/Frognal Conservation Area, contrary to policies D1 (Design) and D2 (Heritage) of the Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed development, in the absence of cycle parking and storage space, has failed to promote cycling and to provide appropriate cycling facilities, contrary to policy T1 (Prioritising walking, cycling and public transport) of the Camden Local Plan 2017. \r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement to secure the residential unit as 'car-free' housing, would be likely to contribute unacceptably to parking stress and congestion in the surrounding area and to promote the use of non-sustainable modes of transport, contrary to policies T1 (Prioritising walking, cycling and public transport) and T2 (Parking and car-free development) of the Camden Local Plan 2017. \r\n"
