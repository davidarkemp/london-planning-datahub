    "Reason : 1 - The proposal would result in the loss of front garden space and part of the front boundary wall, which contributes to the character and appearance of the conservation area, and as such, would be harmful to the character and appearance of the streetscene and the wider Fitzjohn's Netherhall Conservation Area, contrary to policies D1 (Design) and D2 (Heritage) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017 and Policies DH1 (Design) and DH2 (Conservation areas and listed buildings) of the Hampstead Neighbourhood Plan 2018. ",
    "Reason : 2 - The creation of an on-site parking space would promote the use of private motor vehicles, fail to encourage the use of sustainable modes of transport and result in the loss of on-street parking in the surrounding area, contrary to policies T1 (Prioritising walking, cycling and public transport), T2 (Parking and car free development) and A1 (Managing the impact of development) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017."
