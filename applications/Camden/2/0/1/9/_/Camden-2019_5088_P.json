    "Reason : 1 - The proposed extension by reason of its siting, bulk and mass, in addition to the extensions already approved, would have a detrimental impact on the character and appearance of the host building and the South Hampstead Conservation Area contrary to polices D1 (Design) and D2 (Heritage) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017. ",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed extension by reason of the resulting loss of garden space and sense of openness would result in overdevelopment of the site and would be contrary to policies A2 (Open Space) and A3 (Biodiversity) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017."
