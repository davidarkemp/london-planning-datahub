    "Reason : 1 - The proposed single storey rear extension, by reason of its design and mass, represents an overly dominant and incongruous addition which would fail to appear subordinate to the host building and would fail to preserve the legibility of the original outrigger. As such, the proposal would cause unjustified harm to the character and appearance of the subject property, terrace grouping, and surrounding conservation area contrary to policies D1 (Design) and D2 (Heritage) of the Local Plan (2017), policies DC1, DC2, DC3 and DC4 of the Dartmouth Neighbourhood Plan (2020), the London Plan (2016), the London Plan intended to publish (2020), and the National Planning Policy Framework (2019).",
    "Reason : 2 - Insufficient information has been provided to demonstrate there would not be a detrimental impact on the levels of daylight or sunlight received by the neighbouring property No. 41 Croftdown Road, contrary to policy A1 (Managing the Impact of Development) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan (2017), policy DC4 of the Dartmouth Neighbourhood Plan (2020), the London Plan (2016), the London Plan intended to publish (2020), and the National Planning Policy Framework (2019).\r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - By reason of its detailed design, scale, and siting the proposed development would result in an harmful level of light pollution and an unneighbourly sense of enclosure to the neighbouring property No. 41 Croftdown Road, contrary to policy A1 (Managing the Impact of Development) of the Camden Local Plan (2017), policy and DC4 of the Dartmouth Neighbourhood Plan (2020), the London Plan (2016), the London Plan intended to publish (2020), and the National Planning Policy Framework (2019).\r\n"
