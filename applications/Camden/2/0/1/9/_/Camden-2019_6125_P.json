    "Reason : 1 - The proposed change of use from the ground floor studio flat would result in the loss of residential floorspace and would undermine the Council's strategic objective to maintain and increase the supply of housing in the Borough. This would be contrary to policies H3 (Protecting existing homes) and H5 (Protecting and improving affordable housing) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed new Class A3 restaurant use, by virtue of its size, seating capacity and intensity of usage, both within the building and rear garden, would be likely to result in the loss of amenity to neighbouring residents and the local area. This would be contrary to policies A1 (Managing the impact of development), TC2 (Camden's centres and other shopping areas) and TC4 (Town centre uses) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.  \r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - The pergola to the rear for use as outdoor seating for the restaurant would result in an increase in intensity of use of the rear garden area which without an appropriate level of noise mitigation, would be harmful to the amenity of surrounding residents. This would be contrary to policies A1 (Managing the impact of development) and A4 (Noise and vibration) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.  \r\n",
    "Reason : 4 - The proposed extensions at ground and first floor levels, by reason of their location, size, footprint and scale, would appear overly dominant and bulky, would result in loss of valuable garden amenity space, would fail to be subservient to the host building and would harm the character and appearance of the host building, its neighbouring properties and the wider area. This would be contrary to policy D1 (Design) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017. \r\n",
    "Reason : 5 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement securing contributions to offsite cycle parking provision, would fail to secure adequate provision for cyclists, contrary to policies T1 (Prioritising walking, cycling and public transport) and DM1 (Delivery and monitoring) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.   \r\n"
