    "Reason : 2 - The proposed development, by reason of promoting private car use, would likely contribute to increased air pollution and would fail to promote or prioritise the use of sustainable transport, contrary to Policies A1 (Managing the impact of development), T1 (Prioritising walking, cycling and public transport) and T2 (Parking and car-free development) of the Local Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.",
    "Reason : 3 - In the absence of detailed measures to mitigate the loss of permeable green space, the development fails to demonstrate resilience to climate change and would likely contribute to the risk of surface water flooding, contrary to policies CC2 (Adapting to climate change) and CC3 (Water and flooding) of the Local Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017 and policy TR4 (Reducing the Negative Impact of Parking in Highgate) of the Highgate Neighbourhood Development Plan (2017).\r\n\r\n"
