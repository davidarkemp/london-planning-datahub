  "description": "Erection of two storey roof extension at 5th floor level to provide 7 flats (1 x 3-bed, 5 x 2-bed and 1 x 1-bed) with roof terraces facing Crowndale Road and Oakley Square (Class C3), including erection of lift shaft (to the rear) and cycle store and alteration to waste store.",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed two storey roof extension, by reason of its prominent location, height, bulk and design, would be detrimental to the appearance of the host property and would fail to preserve or enhance the character and appearance of the conservation area or preserve the setting of adjacent listed buildings contrary to Policy D1 (Design) and D2 (Heritage) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017. \r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement securing a Construction Management Plan, would be likely to contribute unacceptably to traffic disruption and be detrimental to general highway and pedestrian safety, contrary to policies A1 (Managing the impact of development) and T4 (Sustainable movement of goods and materials) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement to secure car-free housing, would be likely to promote the use of non-sustainable modes of transport and contribute to air pollution and congestion in the surrounding area and, contrary to Policy T2 (Parking and car-free development) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017. \r\n",
    "Reason : 4 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement securing a contribution to affordable housing, would fail to meet the needs of households unable to access market housing, contrary to Policy H4 (Maximising the supply of affordable Housing) and DM1 (Delivery and monitoring) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n",
    "Reason : 5 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement requiring the development to incorporate sustainability measures to reduce carbon emissions and minimise use of energy, water and resources, would fail to be sustainable in its use of its resources and meet the challenge of climate change, contrary to policies CC1 (Climate change mitigation), CC3 (Water and flooding) and DM1 (Delivery and monitoring) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017. \r\n",
    "Reason : 6 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement securing an energy efficiency plan including on-site renewable energy facilities, would fail to be sustainable in its use of resources and fail to take sufficient measures to minimise the effects of, and adapt to, climate change, contrary to policies CC1 (Climate change mitigation), CC4 (Policy CC4 Air quality) and DM1 (Delivery and monitoring) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n"
