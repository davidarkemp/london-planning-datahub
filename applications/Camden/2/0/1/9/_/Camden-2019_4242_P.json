As such the proposals would cause harm to the character and appearance of the host property, the streetscape and the surrounding conservation area contrary to policies D1 (Design) and D2 (Heritage) of the Local Plan (2017) and policies DC3 and DC4 of the Referendum version of the Dartmouth Park Neighbourhood Plan.\r\n"
