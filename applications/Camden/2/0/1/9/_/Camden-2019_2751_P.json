    "Reason : 1 - The existing and relocated railings would appear incongruous above the mansard roof extension and would add harmful clutter to the roofscape. They would be partially visible in both short and long views from front and rear, and as such would have a detrimental impact on the appearance of the host property and adjoining roofscape and the surrounding area and streetscene.  The proposal would therefore be contrary to policy D1 (Design) of the Camden Local Plan 2017 and policy D1 (Design) of the Kentish Town Neighbourhood Plan 2016.\r\n"
