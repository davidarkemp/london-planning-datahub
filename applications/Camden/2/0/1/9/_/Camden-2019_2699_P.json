    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development is not wholly for the purpose of the operator's electronic network and thereby falls outside the terms of Part 16 Class A of the General Permitted Development Order. ",

    "Reason : 3 - The proposed telecommunications kiosk, by virtue of its inappropriate siting, size and design, would fail to reduce opportunities for crime and antisocial behaviour to the detriment of community safety and security, and compromise the safety of those using and servicing the telephone kiosk contrary to policy C5 (Safety and Security) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.",
    "Reason : 4 - The proposed telecommunications kiosk, by virtue of its siting, size and detailed design, and adding unnecessary street clutter, would reduce the amount of useable, unobstructed footway, which would be detrimental to the quality of the public realm, cause harm to highway safety and hinder pedestrian movement and have a detrimental impact on the promotion of walking as an alternative to motorised transport, contrary to policies G1 (Delivery and location of growth), A1 (Managing the impact of development), C6 (Access for All) and and T1 (Prioritising walking, cycling and public transport) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n"
