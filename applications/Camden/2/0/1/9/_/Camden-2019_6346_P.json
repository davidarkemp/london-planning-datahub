  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development, by reason of its design and siting represents an incongruous feature which would fail to preserve the legibility of the dormers, would appear overbearing and would erode the original character and form of the host property. As such, the proposal would harm the character and appearance of the host property and surrounding conservation area contrary to policies D1 (Design) and D2 (Heritage) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan (2017); and  policies DH1 (Design) and DH2 (Conservation areas and listed building) of the Hampstead Neighbourhood Plan (2018). \r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed development, by reason of its design and siting would result in  harmful overlooking and loss of privacy to No. 34 Parliament Hill, contrary to policy A1 (Managing the Impact of Development) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan (2017); and policy DH1 (Design) of the Hampstead Neighbourhood Plan (2020). \r\n"
