    "Reason : 1 - The proposed change of use from cafe (Class A1) to a restaurant use (Class A3) at ground floor level would reduce the proportion of retail units (Class A1) within the designated primary shopping frontage, that would be detrimental to the character, function, vitality and viability of the frontage and wider Kentish Town Town Centre and would be contrary to policies TC2 (Camden's centres and other shopping areas) and TC4 (Town Centre uses) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed change of use, by reason of its size, and proximity to residential properties would result in a significant adverse impact on the amenities of neighbouring occupiers contrary to policies A1 (Managing the impact of development), A4 (Noise and vibration), TC2 (Camden's centres and other shopping areas) and TC4 (Town Centre uses) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - In the absence of information to demonstrate an appropriate design and location for the proposed extract ventilation system, including details of control of odour for the plant and air conditioning systems to serve the proposed A3 use, the proposal would cause unacceptable harm to the amenity of the neighbouring occupiers contrary to policies A1 (Managing the impact of development), A4 (Noise and vibration), TC2 (Camden's centres and other shopping areas) and TC4 (Town Centre uses) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n",
    "Reason : 4 - The  proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement for car-free development, would be likely to contribute unacceptably to parking stress and congestion in the surrounding area, contrary to policies T1 (Prioritising walking, cycling and public transport), T2 (Parking and Car Parking) and A1 (Managing the impact of development) and DM1 (Delivery and monitoring) of the Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n"
