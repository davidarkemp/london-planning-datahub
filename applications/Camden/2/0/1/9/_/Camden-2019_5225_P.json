    "Reason : 1 - The proposed roof extension, by reason of its bulk and detailed design would result in an inappropriate visual relationship with the architectural style and composition of the host building, causing harm to the character and appearance of the building, the streetscene and the Hatton Garden Conservation Area contrary to policies D1 (Design) and D2 (Heritage) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017. \r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement securing car-free housing, would be likely to contribute unacceptably to parking stress and congestion in the surrounding area, contrary to policy T2  (parking and car-free development) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - In the absence of a legal agreement to secure a Construction Management Plan and associated implementation support contribution, the development would fail to ensure that the development can be implemented without causing detrimental impact to residential amenity or the safe and efficient operation of the highway network in the local area. The development would therefore be contrary to policies A1 (managing the impact of development) and T4 (noise and vibration) of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n"
