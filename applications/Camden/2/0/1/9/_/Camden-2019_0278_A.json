    "Condition : 3 - Any advertisement displayed and any site used for the display of advertisements, shall be maintained in a condition that does not impair the visual amenity of the site.\r\n\r\nReason: - As required by regulation 2(1) and Schedule 2 of the Town & Country Planning (Control of Advertisements) (England) Regulations 2007.\r\n",

    "Reason : 1 - The hanging sign, by virtue of its design, location and material used forms an incongruous fixture against the historical nature and identity of the building that thereby represents an inappropriate form of development that is detrimental to the special architectural and historic interest of the host building. This element of the proposal fails to preserve and enhance the character and appearance of the Camden Town Conservation Area and the streetscape and harms the setting of adjacent listed building, contrary to policy D4 (Advertisements) of the Camden Local Plan 2017. ",
    "Reason : 2 - The fascia signs, by virtue of their size, design, location, material to be used and method of illumination (neon) are unsympathetic and incongruous fixtures obscuring architectural and historical details of the building. They would create visual clutter and thereby represent an inappropriate form of development that is detrimental to the special architectural and historic interest of the host building. This element of the proposal fails to preserve and enhance the character and appearance of the Camden Town Conservation Area and the streetscape and would harm the setting of adjacent listed building, contrary to policy D4 (Advertisements) of the Camden Local Plan 2017.",
    "Reason : 3 - The menu boxes, by virtue of their locations and number clutter the lower part of the frontage  and thereby represent an inappropriate form of development that is detrimental to the special architectural and historic interest of the host building. This element of the proposal fails to preserve and enhance the character and appearance of the Camden Town Conservation Area and the streetscape and harms the setting of adjacent listed building, contrary to policy D4 (Advertisements) of the Camden Local Plan 2017.",
    "Reason : 4 - The menu boxes, by virtue of their method of illumination form incongruous features against the historical nature and identity of the building generating an excessive level of illumination combined with the illuminance of the lanterns located above that would thereby represent an inappropriate form of development that is detrimental to the special architectural and historic interest of the host building.
