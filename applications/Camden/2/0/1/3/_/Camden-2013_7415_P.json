    "Reason : 7 - The proposed development, in the absence of a Section 106 legal agreement requiring the development to incorporate sustainability measures to reduce carbon emissions and minimise use of energy, water and resources, would fail to be sustainable in its use of its resources and meet the challenge of climate change contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework chapter 10, paragraphs 93 and 95-97.",
