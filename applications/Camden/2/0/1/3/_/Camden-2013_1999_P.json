Details of the appointment and the appointee's responsibilities shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority prior to the commencement of development. Any subsequent change or reappointment shall be confirmed forthwith for the duration of the construction works.\r\n\r\nReason:  To safeguard the appearance and structural stability of neighbouring buildings and the character of the immediate area in accordance with the requirements of policy CS14 of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Development Policies and policy DP27 (Basements and Lightwells) of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Development Policies.\r\n",
