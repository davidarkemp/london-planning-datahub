  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposal would result in the loss of a non-designated heritage asset of significance to the detriment of the streetscene and wider area, contrary to policy CS14 (Promoting high quality places and conserving our heritage) of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Core Strategy, policy DP25 (Conserving Camden's heritage) of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Development Policies and policies 7.4 (Local Character) and 7.8 (Heritage Assets and Archaeology) of the London Plan, March 2016. ",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed development, by reason of its scale, bulk and detailed design would appear overbearing and out of scale within its surroundings, sitting uncomfortably within the streetscape to the detriment of the character and appearance of the surrounding area, and the extended oversail proposed would be detrimental to the function of Clarendon Grove as a public right of way contrary to policy CS14 (Promoting high quality places and conserving our heritage) of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Core Strategy, policies DP24 (Securing high quality design) and DP25 (Conserving Camden's heritage) of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Development Policies and policies 7.4 (Local Character), 7.6 (Architecture) and 7.8 (Heritage Assets and Archaeology) of the London Plan, March 2016. ",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement formally linking it to serve higher education institutions in Camden or adjoining boroughs, would be likely to contribute to pressure and demand on existing housing in this area, contrary to policies CS1 (Distribution of growth) and CS19 (Delivering and monitoring the Core Strategy) of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Core Strategy and policy DP1 (Mixed use development) of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Development Policies.",
    "Reason : 4 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement securing it as car-free, would be likely to contribute unacceptably to parking stress and congestion in the surrounding area, contrary to policies CS11 (Promoting sustainable and efficient travel) and CS19 (Delivering and monitoring the Core Strategy) of the London Borough of Camden Core Strategy and DP18 (Parking standards and limiting the availability of car parking) and DP19 (Managing the impact of parking) of the London Borough of Camden LDF Development Policies.",
    "Reason : 5 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement securing a construction management plan, would be likely to give rise to conflicts with other road users and would fail to mitigate the impact on the amenities of the area generally, contrary to policies CS5 (Managing the impact of growth and development), CS11 (Promoting sustainable and efficient travel) and CS19 (Delivering and monitoring the Core Strategy) of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Core Strategy and policies DP20 (Movement of goods and materials), DP21 (Development connecting to highway network) and DP26 (Managing the impact of development on occupiers and neighbours) of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Development Policies.",
    "Reason : 6 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement securing a contribution for new or improved public open space, would be likely to contribute to pressure and demand on the existing open space in this area, contrary to policy CS19 (Delivering and monitoring the Core Strategy) of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Core Strategy and policy DP31 (open space and outdoor recreation) of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Development Policies.",
    "Reason : 7 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement securing necessary contributions towards highway works would fail to make provision to restore the pedestrian environment to an acceptable condition, contrary to policies CS11 (sustainable travel) and CS19 (Delivering and monitoring the Core Strategy) of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Core Strategy and policies DP17 (walking, cycling and public transport) and DP21 (Development connecting to the highway network) of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Development Policies.",
    "Reason : 8 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement securing a travel plan and associated monitoring and administrative costs for a period of 5 years, would fail to promote the use of sustainable means of travel, contrary to policies CS11 (sustainable travel) and CS19 (Delivering and monitoring the Core Strategy) of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Core Strategy and policy DP16 (transport implications of development) of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Development Policies.",
    "Reason : 9 - The proposed development, in the absence of a local employment and apprenticeships agreement and a local procurement code will be likely to lead to the exacerbation of local skill shortages and a lack of training and opportunities for local residents and businesses, and would fail to contribute to the regeneration of the area, contrary to policies CS5 (Managing the impact of growth and development), CS8 (Promoting a successful and inclusive Camden economy) and CS19 (Delivering and monitoring the Core Strategy) of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Core Strategy and policy DP13 (Employment sites and premises) of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Development Policies.",
    "Reason : 10 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement securing a sustainability plan, would fail to ensure that the development is designed to take a sustainable approach to the use of resources, contrary to policies CS13 (tackling climate change) and CS19 (Delivering and monitoring the Core Strategy) of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Core Strategy and DP22 (sustainable design and construction) and DP23 (water) of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Development Policies.",
    "Reason : 11 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement securing an energy efficiency and renewable energy plan, would fail to take sufficient measures to minimise the effects of, and adapt to, climate change contrary to policies CS13 (tackling climate change) and CS19 (Delivering and monitoring the Core Strategy) of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Core Strategy and policy DP22 (sustainable design and construction) of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Core Strategy and Development Policies."
