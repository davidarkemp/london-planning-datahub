  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development by reason of its height and detailed design would appear incongruous and overly dominant on Churchway and would have a detrimental effect upon the appearance of the street scene contrary to policy CS14 (Promoting high quality places and conserving our heritage) of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Core Strategy and policy DP24 (Securing high quality design) of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Development Policies.",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed projecting balconies on the rear elevation would result in an undue level of overlooking to neighbouring properties contrary to policy CS5 (Managing the impact of growth and development) of Camden Local Development Framework Core Strategy and policy DP26 (Managing the impact of development on occupiers and neighbours) of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Development Policies.\n",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed development, in the absence of acceptable provision for cycle parking would fail to facilitate and encourage cycling as a sustainable transport alternative contrary to policy CS11 (sustainable travel) of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Core Strategy and policy DP17 (walking, cycling and public transport) of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Development Policies.\n",
    "Reason : 4 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement securing necessary contributions towards highway works would fail to make provision to restore the pedestrian environment to an acceptable condition contrary to policies CS11 (sustainable travel) and CS19 (Delivering and monitoring the Core Strategy) of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Core Strategy and policies DP17 (walking, cycling and public transport) and DP21 (Development connecting to the highway network) of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Development Policies.",
    "Reason : 5 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement to secure the submission and implementation of a Construction Management Plan, would be likely to contribute unacceptably to traffic disruption and dangerous situations for pedestrians and other road users and be detrimental to the amenities of the area generally, contrary to policies CS5 (Managing the impact of growth and development), CS11 (Promoting sustainable and efficient travel) and CS19 (Delivering and monitoring the Core Strategy) of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Core Strategy and policies DP20 (Movement of goods and materials), DP21 (Development connecting to the highway network) and  DP26 (Managing the impact of development on occupiers and neighbours) of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Development Policies. \n",
    "Reason : 6 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement securing car-free housing, would be likely to contribute unacceptably to parking stress and congestion in the surrounding area, contrary to policies CS11 (Promoting sustainable and efficient travel) and CS19 (Delivering and monitoring the Core Strategy) of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Core Strategy and policies DP18 (Parking standards and the availability of car parking) and DP19 (Managing the impact of parking) of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Development Policies.\n\n"
