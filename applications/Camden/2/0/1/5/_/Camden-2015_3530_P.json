  "decision_conditions": [
    "Condition : 1 - The development hereby permitted must be begun not later than the end of three years from the date of this permission.\r\n\r\nReason: In order to comply with the provisions of Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended).\r\n\r\n",
    "Condition : 2 - The development hereby permitted shall be carried out in accordance with the following approved plans: KSR Architects Design and Access Statement (dated June 2015), Skelly and Couch Energy and Sustainability Report (dated June 2015), Heritage Collective Archeological Desk Based Study (dated June 2015), Draft CMP, Deloitte Daylight and Sunlight Report (dated June 2015), DP9 Planning Statement (dated June 2015), Transport Statement (dated June 2015) and Price and Myers Basement Impact Assessment and Construction Method Statement (dated April 2015). \r\n\r\nReason: For the avoidance of doubt and in the interest of proper planning.\r\n",
    "Condition : 3 - No development shall take place until full details of hard and soft landscaping and means of enclosure of all un-built, open areas have been submitted to and approved by the local planning authority in writing. [Such details shall include details of any proposed earthworks including grading, mounding and other changes in ground levels.] The relevant part of the works shall not be carried out otherwise than in accordance with the details thus approved.\r\n\r\nReason: To ensure that the development achieves a high quality of landscaping which contributes to the visual amenity and character of the area in accordance with the requirements of policy CS14 and CS15 of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Core Strategy and policy DP24 [if landscape details] of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Development Policies.\r\n",
    "Condition : 4 - All hard and soft landscaping works shall be carried out in accordance with the approved landscape details by not later than the end of the planting season following completion of the development. Any trees or areas of planting which, within a period of 5 years from the completion of the development, die, are removed or become seriously damaged or diseased, shall be replaced as soon as is reasonably possible and, in any case, by not later than the end of the following planting season, with others of similar size and species, unless the local planning authority gives written consent to any variation.\r\n\r\nReason: To ensure that the landscaping is carried out within a reasonable period and to maintain a high quality of visual amenity in the scheme in accordance with the requirements of policy CS14 and CS15 of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Core Strategy and policy DP24 of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Development Policies.\r\n",
    "Condition : 5 - All work shall be carried out in accordance with the relevant recommendations of British Standard 3998: 2010. (Recommendation for Tree Work) \r\n\r\nReason: To ensure the preservation of the amenity value and health of the tree(s).\r\n",
    "Condition : 6 - Details of the design of building foundations and the layout, with dimensions and levels, of service trenches and other excavations on site in so far as these items may affect trees on or adjoining the site, shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority before any works on site are commenced. The relevant part of the works shall not be carried out otherwise than in accordance with the details thus approved.\r\n\r\nReason: To ensure that the development will not have an adverse effect on existing trees and in order to maintain the character and amenities of the area in accordance with the requirements of policy CS15 of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Core Strategy.\r\n",
    "Condition : 7 - Prior to the first occupation of the building a plan showing details of the green roof including species, planting density, substrate and a section at scale 1:20 showing that adequate depth is available in terms of the construction and long term viability of the green roof, and a programme for a scheme of maintenance shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority. The green roof shall be fully provided in accordance with the approved details prior to first occupation and thereafter retained and maintained in accordance with the approved scheme of maintenance.\r\n\r\nReason: To ensure that the green roof is suitably designed and maintained in accordance with the requirements of policies CS13, CS14, CS15 and CS16 of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Core Strategy and policies DP22, DP23, DP24 and DP32 of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Development Policies.\r\n",
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed demolition by reason of the loss of the existing building which makes a positive contribution to the Hampstead Conservation Area would cause harm to the character and appearance of the conservation area contrary to policies CS14 (Promoting high quality places and conserving our heritage) of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Core Strategy and policy DP25 (Conserving Camden's heritage) of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Development Policies.",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement securing a construction management plan, would be likely to give rise to conflicts with other road users, and be detrimental to the amenities of the area generally, contrary to policies CS5 (Managing the impact of growth and development), CS11 (Promoting sustainable and efficient travel) and CS19 (Delivering and monitoring the Core Strategy) of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Core Strategy and policies DP20 (Movement of goods and materials), DP21 (Development connecting to highway network) and DP26 (Managing the impact of development on occupiers and neighbours) of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Development Policies.\r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement securing a Basement Construction Plan requiring appropriate detailed drainage design, construction method statements, and mitigation and monitoring measures, would be likely to harm local hydrology, geology and land stability conditions and would cause harm to the built and natural environment and local amenity. This would be contrary to policies CS5 (Managing the impact of growth and development), CS14 (Promoting high quality places and conserving our heritage) and CS19 (Delivering and monitoring the Core Strategy) of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Core Strategy and policy DP27 (Basements and lightwells) of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Development Policies."
