The applicant may need to apply for a protected species licence from Natural England, evidence of which should be submitted to the Local Authority.  If more than 1 year passes between the most recent bat survey and the commencement of demolition and/or tree works, an update bat survey must be undertaken immediately prior to demolition or tree works by a licensed bat worker. Evidence that the survey has been undertaken shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority prior to the commencement of demolition and/or tree works.  \r\n\r\nReason: To ensure the development contributes towards the protection of habitats and species, ensuring compliance with the Habitats Regulations and the Wildlife & Countryside Act 1981 (as amended) and in accordance with policy CS15 (Protecting and improving our parks and open spaces and encouraging biodiversity) of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Core Strategy.\r\n",
    "Condition : 19 - All removal of trees, hedgerows, shrubs, scrub or tall herbaceous vegetation shall be undertaken between September and February inclusive. If this is not possible then a suitably qualified ecologist shall check the areas concerned immediately prior to the clearance works to ensure that no nesting or nest-building birds are present. If any nesting birds are present then the vegetation shall not be removed until the fledglings have left the nest.  \r\n\r\nReason: All wild birds, their nests and young are protected during the nesting period under The Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 (as amended).\r\n\r\n",
    "Condition : 20 - Prior to first occupation of the development a plan showing details of bird and bat box locations and types (preferably integrated into the fabric of the buildings) and indication of species to be accommodated shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority. The boxes shall be installed in accordance with the approved plans prior to the occupation of the development and thereafter retained.  \r\n\r\nReason: In order to secure  appropriate features to conserve and enhance wildlife habitats and biodiversity measures within the development, in accordance with the requirements of the London Plan (2016),Camden Planning Guidance, and policy CS15 of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Core Strategy\r\n",
    "Condition : 21 - Prior to commencement of development, full details of a lighting strategy shall be submitted to and agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority.  This shall include information about potential light spill on to buildings, trees, lines of vegetation and bat boxes plus a lux level contour plan which should extend outwards to incremental levels of zero lux.  The lighting strategy should seek to minimise impact on bats and ensure no light spill outside of the site boundaries.  \r\nReason: To limit the impact of light pollution from artificial light on local amenity, intrinsically dark landscapes and nature conservation, in line with NPPF (2012) and in compliance with the Habitats Regulations and the Wildlife & Countryside Act 1981 (as amended).\r\n\r\nReason: To conserve legally protected bats and other nocturnal wildlife in accordance with the requirements of the London Plan (2016, Camden Planning Guidance  and policy CS15 of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Core Strategy\r\n"
