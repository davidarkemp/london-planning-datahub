  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The applicant has failed to demonstrate that the internal design, layout and standard of air quality of the proposed development would provide an acceptable standard of accommodation and amenity for future occupants, contrary to policies CS5 (Managing the impact of growth  and development) and CS16 (Improving Camden's Health and Well-being) of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Core Strategy and policies DP26 (Managing the impact of development on occupiers and neighbours) and DP32 (Air quality and Camden's Clear Zone) of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Development Policies. \r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed development, by reason of the increased activity associated with the hotel operation and the environment resulting from the vents on Adeline Place, would have an unacceptable impact on local residential and pedestrian amenity, contrary to policies CS5 (Managing the impact of growth  and development) and CS7 (Promoting Camden's centres and shops) of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Core Strategy and policies DP12 (Supporting strong centres and managing the impact of food, drink, entertainment and other town centre uses) and DP26 (Managing the impact of development on occupiers and neighbours) of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Development Policies and policy 9 (Residential amenity) of the Fitzrovia Area Action Plan.\r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement securing it as car-free, would be likely to contribute unacceptably to parking stress and congestion in the surrounding area, contrary to policies CS11 (Promoting sustainable and efficient travel) and CS19 (Delivering and monitoring the Core Strategy) of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Core Strategy and policies DP18 (Parking standards and the availability of car parking) and DP19 (Managing the impact of parking) of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Development Policies. \r\n",
    "Reason : 4 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement securing a construction management plan, would be likely to give rise to conflicts with other road users and would fail to mitigate the impact on the amenities of the area generally, contrary to policies CS5 (Managing the impact of growth and development), CS11 (Promoting sustainable and efficient travel) and CS19 (Delivering and monitoring the Core Strategy) of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Core Strategy and policies DP20 (Movement of goods and materials), DP21 (Development connecting to highway network) and DP26 (Managing the impact of development on occupiers and neighbours) of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Development Policies.\r\n",
    "Reason : 5 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement for securing a Hotel Guest and Servicing Management Plan, would be likely to generate adverse impacts upon the amenities of the area and neighbouring residential properties contrary to policies CS5 (managing impact of growth),  CS11 (sustainable travel) and CS19 (Delivering and monitoring the Core Strategy) of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Core Strategy and policies DP14 (Tourism development and visitor accommodation),  DP20 (Movement of goods and materials) and DP26 (Managing the impact of development on occupiers and neighbours) of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Development Policies. \r\n",
    "Reason : 6 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement securing a contribution for new or improved public open space, would be likely to contribute to pressure and demand on the existing open space in this area, contrary to policy CS19 (Delivering and monitoring the Core Strategy) of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Core Strategy and policy DP31 (open space and outdoor recreation) of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Development Policies.\r\n",
    "Reason : 7 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement securing necessary contributions towards highway works would fail to make provision to restore the pedestrian environment to an acceptable condition, contrary to policies CS11 (sustainable travel) and CS19 (Delivering and monitoring the Core Strategy) of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Core Strategy and policies DP17 (walking, cycling and public transport) and DP21 (Development connecting to the highway network) of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Development Policies.\r\n",
    "Reason : 8 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement securing a travel plan and associated monitoring and administrative costs for a period of 5 years, would fail to promote the use of sustainable means of travel, contrary to policies CS11 (sustainable travel) and CS19 (Delivering and monitoring the Core Strategy) of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Core Strategy and policy DP16 (transport implications of development) of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Development Policies.\r\n",
    "Reason : 9 - The proposed development, in the absence of a local employment and apprenticeships agreement and a local procurement code will be likely to lead to the exacerbation of local skill shortages and a lack of training and opportunities for local residents and businesses, and would fail to contribute to the regeneration of the area, contrary to policies CS5 (Managing the impact of growth and development), CS8 (Promoting a successful and inclusive Camden economy) and CS19 (Delivering and monitoring the Core Strategy) of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Core Strategy and policy DP13 (Employment sites and premises) of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Development Policies.\r\n",
    "Reason : 10 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement for securing a contribution towards pedestrian, cycling and environmental improvements, would fail to contribute to supporting sustainable modes of travel, enhance the public realm or mitigate highways concerns, contrary to policies CS14 (Promoting high quality places and conserving our heritage), CS11 (Promoting sustainable and efficient travel), CS17 (Making Camden a safer place) and CS19 (Delivering and monitoring the Core Strategy) of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Core Strategy and policies DP24 (Securing high quality design), DP16 (The transport implications of development) and DP17 (Walking, cycling and public transport) of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Development Policies.\r\n",
    "Reason : 11 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement securing a sustainability plan, would fail to ensure that the development is designed to take a sustainable approach to the use of resources, contrary to policies CS13 (tackling climate change) and CS19 (Delivering and monitoring the Core Strategy) of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Core Strategy and DP22 (sustainable design and construction) and DP23 (water) of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Development Policies.\r\n",
    "Reason : 12 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement securing an energy efficiency and renewable energy plan, would fail to take sufficient measures to minimise the effects of, and adapt to, climate change contrary to policies CS13 (tackling climate change) and CS19 (Delivering and monitoring the Core Strategy) of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Core Strategy and policy DP22 (sustainable design and construction) of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Core Strategy and Development Policies. \r\n"
