  "description": "Erection of single storey mansard roof extension to provide 1 x 2 bedroom flat, associated to extant permissions ref:2013/7434/P & 2013/7457/L (Internal and external alterations associated with the change of use from offices (B1a) to residential (C3) and partial demolition, alteration and extension to create 9 residential unit), granted on 23/01/2015. \n",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed roof extension, by reason of its location and loss of historic fabric and form, would be detrimental to the character, appearance and special architectural and historic interest of the host building, contrary to policy CS14 (Promoting high quality places and conserving our heritage) of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Core Strategy and policies DP24 (Securing high quality design) and DP25 (Conserving Camden's Heritage) of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Development Policies.",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement to secure affordable housing on-site in addition to a contribution in lieu, would fail to maximise the contribution of the site to the supply of affordable housing in the borough, contrary to policies CS6 (Providing Quality Homes) and CS19 (Delivering and monitoring the Core Strategy) of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Core Strategy, policy DP3 (Contributions to the supply of affordable housing) of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Development Policies.",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement securing a design stage and post-construction sustainability review achieving at least a minimum level 'very good' BREEAM rating, would fail to be sustainable in its use of resources, contrary to policies CS13 (Tackling climate change through promoting higher environmental standards), CS16 (Improving Camden's health and well-being) and CS19 (Delivering and monitoring the Core Strategy) of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Core Strategy and policies DP22 (Promoting sustainable design and construction) and DP23 (Water) and DP32 (Air quality and Camden's Clear Zone) of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Development Policies.",
    "Reason : 4 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement securing a \nfinancial contribution towards the provision of, improvement to and maintenance of public open space in the surrounding area, would be likely to contribute unacceptably to pressure and demand on the Borough's existing open space facilities, contrary to policies CS15 (Protecting and improving open spaces & encouraging biodiversity), CS19 (Delivering and monitoring the Core Strategy) and DP31 (open space and outdoor recreation) of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Core Strategy and Development Policies. ",
    "Reason : 5 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement securing a \nfinancial contribution towards educational infrastructure, would be likely to contribute to increased pressure and demand on the Borough's educational facilities, contrary to policies CS10 (Supporting Community Facilities and Services) and CS19 (Delivering and monitoring the Core Strategy) of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Core Strategy and policy DP15 (Community and leisure uses) of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Development Policies. ",
    "Reason : 6 - The proposed development, in the absence of a construction management plan, would be likely to contribute unacceptably to traffic disruption and dangerous situations for pedestrians, cyclists and other road users and would be detrimental to the amenities of the area generally, contrary to DP20 (movement of goods and materials) and DP26 (impact on occupiers and neighbours) of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Development Policies.",
    "Reason : 7 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement securing car-free development, would be likely to contribute unacceptably to parking stress and congestion in the surrounding area, contrary to policies CS11 (Promoting  sustainable and efficient travel) and CS19 (Delivering and monitoring the Core Strategy) of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Core Strategy and policy DP18 (Parking standards and the availability of car parking) of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Development Policies. ",
    "Reason : 8 - The proposed development, in the absence of a travel plan statement, would be likely to contribute unacceptably to traffic disruption and dangerous situations for pedestrians, cyclists and other road users and would be detrimental to the amenities of the area generally, contrary to DP20 (movement of goods and materials) and DP26 (impact on occupiers and neighbours) of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Development Policies.",
    "Reason : 9 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement to secure local labour and procurement, would fail to contribute towards the creation of local employment and business opportunities and to contribute to the regeneration of the area, contrary to policies CS8 (Promoting a successful and inclusive Camden Economy and CS19 (Delivering and monitoring the Core Strategy) of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Core Strategy.",
    "Reason : 10 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement securing \nnecessary contributions towards highway works would fail to make provision to restore the pedestrian environment to an acceptable condition after the construction works contrary to policy CS11 (sustainable travel) of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Core Strategy and DP17 (walking, cycling and public transport) and DP21 (Development connecting to the highway network) of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Development Policies.
