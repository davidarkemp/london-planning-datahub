    "Reason : 1 - The proposed rear dormer, by reason of the scale and bulk along the roof ridge and its positioning in relationship with the existing roof form would be an incongruous addition that would harm the appearance of the host building, disrupt its symmetry with the adjoining terrace properties and would unacceptably alter the private and public views from the public domain and the neighbouring gardens. The proposal therefore fails to preserve and enhance the character and appearance of the Belsize Park Conservation Area, and the proposed extension would set an unwelcomed precedent. This is contrary to policies CS5 (Managing the impact of growth and development) and CS14 (Promoting high quality places and conserving our heritage) of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Core Strategy; and policies DP24 (Securing high quality design) and DP25 (Conserving Camden's heritage) of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Development Policies."
