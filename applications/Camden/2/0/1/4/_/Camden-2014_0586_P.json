  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement to secure car-free housing, would be likely to contribute unacceptably to parking stress and congestion in the surrounding area, contrary to policies CS11 (Promoting sustainable and efficient travel) and CS19 (Delivering and monitoring the Core Strategy) of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Core Strategy; and policy DP18 (Parking standards and limiting the availability of car parking) of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Development Policies.\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement to secure a construction management plan, would be likely to create an unacceptable impact on the amenity of neighbouring properties, contrary to policy CS5 (Managing the impact of growth and development) of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Core Strategy; and policies DP26 (Managing the impact of development on occupiers and neighbours) and DP28 (Noise and vibration) of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Development Policies.\n",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement requiring a sustainability review achieving Code Level 4 would fail to be sustainable in its use of resources, contrary to policies CS13 (Tackling climate change) and CS19 (Delivering and monitoring the Core Strategy) of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Core Strategy, DP22 (Sustainable construction), and DP23 (Water) of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Development Policies.\n",
    "Reason : 4 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement requiring a contribution towards repair of the public highway in the event of damage caused during the construction period, contrary to policies CS14 (Promoting high quality places and conserving our heritage) of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Core Strategy, and DP21 (Development connecting to the highway network) of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Development Policies.\n",
    "Reason : 5 - The proposed development, by virtue of its bulk, massing, front building line and proximity to the boundary of the properties to the south, would be unduly prominent and would harm the character and appearance of the Belsize Conservation Area. This would be contrary to policies CS14 (Promoting high quality places and conserving our heritage) of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Core Strategy, DP24 (Securing high quality design) and DP25 (Conserving Camden's heritage) of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Development Policies.\n",
    "Reason : 6 - The proposed development, by virtue of its height and depth along the boundary with properties to the south, would result in an overbearing development harmful to the amenity of neighbouring properties. This would be contrary to policy CS5 (Managing the impact of growth and development) of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Core Strategy, and policy DP26 (Managing the impact of development on occupiers and neighbours) of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Development Policies.\n",
    "Reason : 7 - The proposed development, by virtue of the excavation across the full extent of the site and the potential shallow depth of soil above the excavation, would fail to provide opportunities for future soft landscaping. This would be contrary to policies DP23 (Water), DP24 (Securing high quality design) and DP27 (Basements and lightwells) of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Development Policies.\n"
