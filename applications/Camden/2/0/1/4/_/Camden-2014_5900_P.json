  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development by virtue of its height, scale, and detailed design would have an adverse impact on the character and appearance of the surrounding street scene and local area and would have an adverse impact on the amenity enjoyed by neighbouring residents to the north, namely those within properties on Castle Street in terms of outlook and increased sense of enclosure.  The application is therefore contrary to policies CS5 (Managing the impact of growth and development), CS14 (Promoting high quality places and conserving our heritage), DP24 (Securing high quality design), DP25 (Conserving Camden's heritage) and DP26 (Managing the impact of development on occupiers and neighbours) of the London Borough of Camden Core Strategy and Development Policies 2010.\r\n\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement for car-free housing, would be likely to contribute unacceptably to parking stress and congestion in the surrounding area, contrary to policies CS11 (Promoting sustainable and efficient travel), CS19 (Delivering and monitoring the Core Strategy) and DP18 (Parking standards and limiting the availability of car parking) of the London Borough of Camden Core Strategy and Development Policies 2010.\r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement for securing contributions for public open space, would be likely to contribute to pressure and demand on the existing open space in this area contrary to policies CS15 (Protecting and improving our parks and open spaces and encouraging biodiversity) and CS19 (Delivering and monitoring the Core Strategy) of the London Borough of Camden Core Strategy and Development Policies 2010.\r\n",
    "Reason : 4 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement securing a contribution towards educational infrastructure, would place an unacceptable strain on local educational resources, contrary to policies CS10 (Supporting Community Facilities and Services) and CS19 (Delivering and monitoring the Core Strategy) of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Core Strategy.",
    "Reason : 5 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement to secure measures to incorporate environmental sustainability measures (including provision of on-site renewables), in its use of energy, water and resources, including the submission of post-construction reviews, would be contrary to policy CS13 (Tackling climate change through promoting higher environmental standards) of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Core Strategy and DP22 (Promoting Sustainable Design and Construction)  and DP23 (Water) of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Development Policies.\r\n",
    "Reason : 6 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement to secure a construction management plan, would be likely to give rise to conflicts with other road users and be detrimental to the amenities of the area generally, contrary to policies CS5 (Managing the impact of growth and development), CS11 (Promoting Sustainable and efficient travel) and CS19 (Delivering and monitoring the Core Strategy), DP20 (Movement of goods and materials), DP26 (Managing the impact of development on occupiers and neighbours), DP28 (Noise and vibration) and DP32 (Air Quality and Camden's Clear Zone) of the London Borough of Camden Core Strategy and Development Policies 2010.",
    "Reason : 7 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement securing a highways contribution, would be likely to give risk to damage to the public highway and fail to ensure that the footway ties the development contrary to policies CS11 (Promoting sustainable and efficient travel), CS19 (Delivering and monitoring the Core Strategy) and DP21 (Development connecting to the highway network) of the London Borough of Camden Core Strategy and Development Policies 2010.\r\n",
    "Reason : 8 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement securing a Travel Plan, would fail to mitigate the impact of development created by increased trips, contrary to policies CS11 (Promoting sustainable and efficient travel), DP16 (The transport implications of development) and DP17 (Walking, cycling and public transport) of the London Borough of Camden Core Strategy and Development Policies 2010.\r\n",
    "Reason : 9 - The proposed development, in absence of a legal agreement securing  the retention and implementation of the front fa�ade, would fail to demonstrate that the proposal would maintain the structural stability of the front fa�ade, and would not, in turn, have an adverse impact on the character and appearance of the surround street scene and local area.  The proposal is therefore contrary to policies CS14 (Promoting high quality places and conserving our heritage) and DP27 (Basements and Lightwells) of the London Borough of Camden Core Strategy and Development Policies 2010.\r\n",
    "Reason : 10 - The proposed development, in absence of a legal agreement securing a Basement construction plan would fail to demonstrate that the proposal would maintain the structural stability of the retained front facade, and would not adversely impact the local water environment and drainage. The proposal is thereby contrary to policy CS14 (Promoting high quality places and conserving our heritage), CS19 (delivering and monitoring the Core Strategy) of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Core Strategy and policies DP23 (Water), DP24 (Securing high quality design), DP27 (Basements and Lightwells) of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Development Policies.\r\n"
