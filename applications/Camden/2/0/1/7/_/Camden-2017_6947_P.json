  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed demolition of the front wall and use of the entire front garden area for parking would, by virtue of the loss of characteristic boundary treatment, opportunity for soft landscaping and excessive levels of hard-surfaced area, result in detrimental harm to the character and appearance of the host property, streetscene and the West End Green Conservation Area, contrary to Policies D1 (Design) and D2 (Heritage) of the Camden Local Plan 2017 and Policies 2 and 3 of the Fortune Green and West Hampstead Neighbourhood Plan 2015.\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed development, by virtue of the loss of on-street parking and creation of additional private off-street parking capacity, would exacerbate issues of parking stress within the CPZ and surrounding area and would fail to encourage sustainable modes of transport for the occupiers of the property, contrary to Policies T1 (Prioritising walking, cycling and public transport), T2 (Parking and car free development), and A1 (Managing the impact of development) of the Camden Local Plan 2017 as well as Policy 7 of the Fortune Green and West Hampstead Neighbourhood Plan 2015\r\n"
