    "Reason : 1 - The proposed internally illuminated advertisement panel by reasons of its design, location and illumination would be unduly dominant and visually disruptive, adding visual clutter harmful to the prevailing character of the streetscene and wider Bloomsbury Conservation Area contrary to policies D1, D2 and D4 of the Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed illuminated advertisement panel by reason of its' location and illumination, would fail to reduce opportunities for crime and anti-social behaviour to the detriment of community safety and security, and compromise the safety of those using and servicing the payphone kiosk contrary to policy C5 (Safety and security) of the Camden Local Plan 2017."
