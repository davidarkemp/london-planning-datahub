    "Condition : 1 - The development hereby permitted shall be carried out in accordance with the following approved plans:\r\n\r\n740_PL_001_A, 740_PL_002_A, 740_PL_003_A, 740_PL_004_B, 40_PL_005_B, 740_PL_006_B, 740_PL_007_A, 740_PL_008_A, 740_PL_009_A, 40_PL_010_A, 740_PL_011_B, 740_PL_012_B, 740_PL_013_B, 740_PL_014_B, 40_PL_015_B, 740_PL_016_B, 740_PL_017_B, 740_PL_018_B, 740_PL_019_B, 40_PL_020_B.\r\n\r\nSupporting documents: 740_PL_021_A, 740_PL_022_A, 740_PL_023_A, 740_PL_024_A; Design & Access Statement P6_170511 (dated 11.05.17), Covering Letter (dated 16.05.17), Plant Noise Impact Assessment (ref.

    "Condition : 2 - The temporary structures in the Wilkins Quad hereby approved shall be dismantled and removed from the site and the site made good before 5 years from the date of this permission. \r\n\r\nReason: The type of structure is not such as the Council is prepared to approve, other than for a limited period, in view of its appearance and impact upon the setting of the adjacent listed buildings. The permanent retention of the structure would therefore be contrary to the requirements of policy D1 and D2 of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n",
    "Condition : 3 - Details as appropriate in respect of the following shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority before the relevant part of the work is begun: \r\n\r\na) Manufacturer's specification details and/or samples of all facing materials (to be submitted to the Local Planning Authority) and samples of those materials (to be provided on site).    \r\n\r\nb) Details including elevations at 1:10 of the artwork to the cover / external shroud.\r\n\r\nc) A lighting schedule for the external illuminations proposed including a description of the proposed hours of operation, light spillage, light levels and full details of proposed equipment \r\n\r\nThe relevant part of the works shall be carried out in accordance with the details thus approved and all approved samples shall be retained on site during the course of the works. \r\n\r\nReason:  To safeguard the appearance of the premises and the character of the immediate area in accordance with the requirements of policies D1, D2 and A1 of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n",

All trees on the site, or parts of trees growing from adjoining sites, unless shown on the permitted drawings as being removed, shall be retained and protected from damage in accordance with the approved protection details.\r\n\r\nReason: To ensure that the development will not have an adverse effect on existing trees and in order to maintain the character and amenity of the area in accordance with the requirements of policies D1, D2, A1 and A3 of the Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n",
    "Condition : 5 - Prior to first occupation of the structure hereby approved in the Wilkins Quad, full details of a scheme of maintenance shall be submitted to and approved by the local planning authority in writing. Such details shall include details of a method statement for maintenance, cleaning and repair of the temporary structure. The structures shall be maintained in accordance with the method statement as approved. \r\n\r\nReason: To ensure that the development achieves and maintains a high quality of design which contributes to the visual amenity and character of the area and to minimise the impact of the temporary structure on the character of the Conservation Area and the setting of the listed buildings in accordance with the requirements of policies D1 and D2 of the Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n",
    "Condition : 6 - Noise levels at a point 1 metre external to sensitive facades shall be at least 5dB(A) less than the existing background measurement (LA90), expressed in dB(A) when all plant/equipment (or any part of it) is in operation unless the plant/equipment hereby permitted will have a noise that has a distinguishable, discrete continuous note (whine, hiss, screech, hum) and/or if there are distinct impulses (bangs, clicks, clatters, thumps), then the noise levels from that piece of plant/equipment at any sensitive faï¿½ade shall be at least 10dB(A) below the LA90, expressed in dB(A). \r\n\r\nReason: To safeguard the amenities of the adjoining premises and the area generally in accordance with the requirements of policies G1, A1 and A4 of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017\r\n",
    "Condition : 7 - Before the use commences, the air ventilating system and air-conditioning plant shall be provided with sound attenuation measures in accordance with the Plant Noise Impact Assessment (ref. MOEC15170-005 rev1) included within approved documents. All such measures shall thereafter be retained and maintained in accordance with the manufacturers' recommendations. \r\n\r\nReason: To safeguard the amenities of the adjoining premises and the area generally in accordance with the requirements of policy G1, A1, and A4 of the London Borough of Camden Local Plan 2017.\r\n \r\n"
