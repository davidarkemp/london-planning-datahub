    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development, by virtue of the scale, nature and location of development on designated Open Space would be lead to a loss of protected land detrimental to the open nature of the site and be harmful to the character and appearance of the surrounding area and this part of Dartmouth Park Conservation Area, and would lead to the loss of land which provides a valuable contribution in terms of health, sport, recreation and play.  The application is therefore contrary to policies CS14 (Promoting high quality places and conserving our heritage) and CS15 (Protecting and improving our parks and open spaces and encouraging biodiversity) of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Core Strategy and policies DP15 (community & leisure uses), DP24 (Securing high quality design), DP25 (Conserving Camden's heritage) and  DP31 (Provision of, and improvements to, open space and outdoor space and recreation facilities) of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Development Policies.",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed development, in the absence of an appropriate contribution towards the supply of affordable housing, and the subsequent absence of a legal agreement securing an appropriate contribution to the supply of affordable housing, fails to make adequate provision to the borough's strategic affordable housing targets, contrary to policies CS6 (Providing quality homes) and CS19 (Delivering and monitoring the Core Strategy) of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Core Strategy and policy DP3 (Contributions to the supply of affordable housing) of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Development Policies.\r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed development, by reason of the residential unit density proposed, would fail to maximise the contribution of the site to providing additional homes in the borough, contrary to policy CS6 (Providing Quality Homes) of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Core Strategy and policy DP2 (Making full use of Camden's capacity for housing) of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Development Policies. ",
    "Reason : 4 - The proposed development, by virtue of its failure to provide a mix of large and small homes, would fail to contribute to the creation of mixed and inclusive communities, contrary to policy CS6 (Providing quality homes) of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Core Strategy and policy DP5 (Homes of different sizes) of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Development Policies.\r\n",
    "Reason : 5 - The proposed development, in the absence of the submission of sufficient information by the applicant, has failed to demonstrate that the proposed basement excavation would not cause harm to the built and natural environment and local amenity and does not result in flooding or ground instability, contrary to policies CS5 (Managing the impact of growth and development) and CS14 (Promoting high quality places and conserving our heritage) of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Core Strategy and policies DP23 (Water), DP25 (Conserving Camden's heritage), DP26 (Managing the impact of development on occupiers and neighbours) and DP27 (Basements and Lightwells) of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Development Policies.\r\n\r\n",
    "Reason : 6 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement securing a design stage and post-construction sustainability review achieving at least a minimum Level 4 of the Code for Sustainable Homes for the residential units proposed, would fail to be sustainable in its use of resources, contrary to policies CS13 (Tackling climate change through promoting higher environmental standards), CS16 (Improving Camden's health and well-being) and CS19 (Delivering and monitoring the Core Strategy) of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Core Strategy and policies DP22 (Promoting sustainable design and construction) and DP23 (Water) of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Development Policies.\r\n",
    "Reason : 7 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement securing a sustainable energy strategy including the on-site renewable energy facilities and energy efficiency measures proposed, would fail to be sustainable in its use of resources and fail to take sufficient measures to minimise the effects of, and adapt to, climate change, contrary to policies CS13 (Tackling climate change through promoting higher environmental standards), CS16 (Improving Camden's health and well-being) and CS19 (Delivering and monitoring the Core Strategy) of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Core Strategy and policies DP22 (Promoting sustainable design and construction), DP23 (Water) and DP32 (Air quality and Camden's Clear Zone) of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Development Policies. \r\n",
    "Reason : 8 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement securing a financial contribution towards educational infrastructure, would be likely to contribute to increased pressure and demand on the Borough's educational facilities, contrary to policies CS10 (Supporting Community Facilities and Services) and CS19 (Delivering and monitoring the Core Strategy) of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Core Strategy and policy DP15 (Community and leisure uses) of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Development Policies. \r\n",
    "Reason : 9 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement securing the submission and implementation of a Construction Management Plan, would be likely to contribute unacceptably to traffic disruption and road safety hazards and be detrimental to the amenities of the area generally, contrary to policies CS5 (Managing the impact of growth and development), CS11 (Promoting sustainable and efficient travel) and CS19 (Delivering and monitoring the Core Strategy) of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Core Strategy and policies DP20 (Movement of goods and materials), DP21 (Development connecting to the highway network) and DP26 (Managing the impact of development on occupiers and neighbours) of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Development Policies.\r\n",
    "Reason : 10 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement securing car-capped housing for the eight residential units proposed, would be likely to contribute unacceptably to parking stress and congestion in the surrounding area, contrary to policies CS11 (Promoting sustainable and efficient travel) and CS19 (Delivering and monitoring the Core Strategy) of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Core Strategy and policy DP18 (Parking standards and the availability of car parking) of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Development Policies. \r\n",
    "Reason : 11 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement securing a servicing management plan, would not secure a strategy to prevent traffic and other activities associated with the servicing needs of the development from causing serious disruption to amenities in the area and to the maintenance of the satisfactory and safe operation of the public highway around the development site, contrary to policies CS5 (Managing the impact of growth and development), CS11 (Promoting sustainable and efficient travel) and CS19 (Delivering and monitoring the Core Strategy) of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Core Strategy and policies DP20 (Movement of goods and materials), DP21 (Development connecting to the highway network) and DP26 (Managing the impact of development on occupiers and neighbours) of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Development Policies.\r\n",
    "Reason : 12 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement securing necessary highway works, would fail to secure adequate provision for and safety of pedestrians and have an unacceptable impact on the public highway, contrary to policies CS5 (Managing the impact of growth and development), CS11 (Promoting sustainable and efficient travel) and CS19 (Delivering and monitoring the Core Strategy) of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Core Strategy and policies DP16 (Transport implications of development), DP17 (Walking, cycling and public transport), DP21 (Development connecting to highway network) and DP26 (Managing the impact of development on occupiers and neighbours) of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Development Policies. \r\n",
    "Reason : 13 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement securing necessary contribution towards pedestrian, cycling and environmental improvements in the area would fail to make sufficient provision in a sustainable manner for the increased trips generated by the development causing a cumulative detrimental impact on the borough's transport network, contrary to policies CS11 (Promoting sustainable and efficient travel) and CS19 (Delivering and monitoring the Core Strategy) of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Core Strategy and policies DP16 (Transport implications of development), DP17 (Walking, cycling and public transport) and DP21 (Development connecting to highway network) of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Development Policies.\r\n",
    "Reason : 14 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement securing a travel plan and associated financial contribution towards the subsequent review and monitoring of the travel plan, would be likely to give rise to significantly increased car-borne trips contrary policies CS11 (Promoting sustainable and efficient travel) and CS19 (Delivering and monitoring the Core Strategy) of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Core Strategy and policy DP16 (Transport implications of development) of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Development Policies.\r\n",
    "Reason : 15 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement securing a financial contribution towards necessary changes to the local Controlled Parking Zone as a consequence of the proposed development, would have a detrimental impact on local roads in the area and the Strategic Road Network, including bus routes and bus stop/stand locations, contrary to policies CS11 (Promoting sustainable and efficient travel) and CS19 (Delivering and monitoring the core strategy) of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Core Strategy and policies DP16 (The transport implications of development) and DP19 (Managing the impact of parking) of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Development Policies. \r\n",
    "Reason : 16 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement securing a phasing plan for the proposed works to the existing Mansfield Bowling Club building being completed and ready for use/occupation prior to the first occupation of any of the proposed residential units, would be detrimental to the open nature of the site and be harmful to the character and appearance of the surrounding area and this part of Dartmouth Park Conservation Area, contrary to policies CS14 (Promoting high quality places and conserving our heritage), CS15 (Protecting and improving our parks and open spaces and encouraging biodiversity) and CS19 (Delivering and monitoring the core strategy) of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Core Strategy and policies DP24 (Securing high quality design) and DP31 (Provision of, and improvements to, open space and outdoor space and recreation facilities) of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Development Policies.\r\n"
