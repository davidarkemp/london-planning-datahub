  "description": "Erection of an additional 7th floor to provide 3 residential units (Class C3), including external terrace area with green roof and associated alterations.",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed roof extension, by virtue of its height, mass and design would create a top heavy, tiered addition which would appear incongruous on and out of keeping with the simple, robust, rectangular form of the host building and would be harmful to the character and appearance of the building, the group which it belongs and the streetscene and would be contrary to policy CS14 (Promoting high quality places and conserving our heritage) the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Core Strategy; policy DP24 (Securing high quality design) and DP25 (Conserving Camden's heritage) of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Development Policies.\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed development, by virtue of the fact that it fails to achieve a minimum Code Level 4 Code for Sustainable Homes rating would fail to be sustainable in its use of resources, contrary to policies CS13 (Tackling climate change through promoting higher environmental standards), CS16 (Improving Camden's health and well-being) and CS19 (Delivering and monitoring the Core Strategy) of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Core Strategy and policies DP22 (Promoting sustainable design and construction) and DP23 (Water) and of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Development Policies.\r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed development would fail to provide any affordable housing on site or sufficient justification for this shortfall in provision, contrary to policy CS6 (Providing quality homes) of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Core Strategy and policy DP3 (Contributions to the supply of affordable housing) of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Development Policies and policies 3.8, 3.9, 3.11, 3.12 and 3.13 of the London Plan July 2011.\r\n",
    "Reason : 4 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement for a car free development, would be likely to contribute unacceptably to parking stress and congestion in the surrounding area, contrary to policies CS11 (promoting sustainable and efficient travel) and CS19 (delivering and monitoring the core strategy) of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Core Strategy; policy DP19 (managing the impact of parking) of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Development Policies.\r\n",
    "Reason : 5 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement to secure financial contributions towards highway works to repave the footway adjacent to the site, would be likely to result in an unacceptable impact on the public highway and pedestrian safety, contrary to policies CS11 (Promoting sustainable and efficient travel) and CS19 (Delivering and monitoring the Core Strategy) of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Core Strategy and policies DP16 (Transport implications of development), DP17 (Walking, cycling and public transport) and DP21 (Development connecting to the highway network) of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Development Policies.\r\n",
    "Reason : 6 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement to secure the submission and implementation of a Construction Management Plan, would be likely to contribute unacceptably to traffic disruption and dangerous situations for pedestrians and other road users and be detrimental to the amenities of the area generally, contrary to policies CS5 (Managing the impact of growth and development), CS11 (Promoting sustainable and efficient travel) and CS19 (Delivering and monitoring the Core Strategy) of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Core Strategy and policies DP20 (Movement of goods and materials), DP21 (Development connecting to the highway network) and DP26 (Managing the impact of development on occupiers and neighbours) of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Development Policies.\r\n",
    "Reason : 7 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement securing a servicing management plan, would not secure a strategy to prevent traffic and other activities associated with the servicing needs of the development from causing serious disruption to amenities in the area and to the maintenance of the satisfactory and safe operation of the public highway around the development site. The proposal would therefore be contrary to policies CS5 (Managing the impact of growth and development), CS11 (Promoting sustainable and efficient travel) and CS19 (Delivering and monitoring the Core Strategy) of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Core Strategy and policies DP21 (Development connecting to the highway network) and DP26 (Managing the impact of development on occupiers and neighbours) of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Development Policies.\r\n",
    "Reason : 8 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement for securing contributions for public open space, would be likely to contribute to pressure and demand on the existing open space in this area contrary to policies CS15 (protecting and improving our parks and open spaces and encouraging biodiversity) and CS19 (delivering and monitoring the core strategy) of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Core Strategy.\r\n",
    "Reason : 9 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement to secure a financial contribution towards educational infrastructure, would be likely to contribute to increased pressure and demand on the Borough's educational facilities, contrary to policies CS10 (Supporting Community Facilities and Services) and CS19 (Delivering and monitoring the Core Strategy) of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Core Strategy.\r\n"
