  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development by reason of its lack of inclusion of a proportion of permanent residential accommodation would fail to provide a satisfactory contribution to the supply of housing (Class C3) in the Borough, contrary to policy CS6 (providing quality homes) of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Core Strategy and policy DP2 (making full use of Camden's capacity for housing) of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Development Policies.\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed development would result in an unacceptable level of noise and disturbance within the locality, particularly along Red Lion Street and Princeton Street, which would harm the local character of the area and harm the living conditions of the occupiers of neighbouring dwellings, contrary to policy CS5 (managing the impact of growth and development) of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Core Strategy and policies DP14 (tourism development and visitor accommodation) and DP26 (managing the impact of development on occupiers and neighbours) of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Development Policies.\r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement securing necessary contributions towards highway works would fail to make provision to restore the pedestrian environment to an acceptable condition after the construction works contrary to policy CS11 (sustainable travel) of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Core Strategy and DP17 (walking, cycling and public transport) and DP21 (Development connecting to the highway network) of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Development Policies.\r\n",
    "Reason : 4 - The proposed development, in the absence of a service management plan, would be likely to give rise to conflicts with other road users, pedestrians and local residents contrary to policies CS11 (Promoting sustainable and efficient travel) of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Core Strategy and DP16 (transport implications of development) and DP20 (movement of goods and materials) of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Development Policies.\r\n",
    "Reason : 5 - The proposed development, in the absence of a construction management plan, would be likely to give rise to conflicts with other road users, and be detrimental to the amenities of the area generally, contrary to DP20 (movement of goods and materials) and DP26 (impact on occupiers and neighbours) of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Development Policies.",
    "Reason : 6 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement securing a sustainable buildings plan, would fail to ensure a sustainable and resource efficient approach contrary to policy CS13 (tackling climate change) of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Core Strategy and DP22 (sustainable design and construction) and DP23 (water) of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Development Policies.\r\n",
    "Reason : 7 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement securing a sustainable energy strategy, would fail to take sufficient measures to minimise the effects of, and adapt to, climate change contrary to policies CS13 (tackling climate change) and DP22 (sustainable design and construction) of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Core Strategy and Development Policies.",
    "Reason : 8 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement securing contributions for training and employment, would fail to provide for necessary training and employment of local people contrary to policies CS5 (managing impact of growth) and CS8 (promoting a successful and inclusive Camden economy) of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Core Strategy.",
    "Reason : 9 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement to secure a travel plan, would be likely to give rise to significantly increased car-borne trips, contrary to policy CS11 (Promoting sustainable and efficient travel) of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Core Strategy; and policies DP16 (The transport implications of development) and DP19 (Managing the impact of parking) of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Development Policies.\r\n",
    "Reason : 10 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement to secure local labour and procurement, would fail to contribute towards the creation of local employment and business opportunities and to contribute to the regeneration of the area, contrary to policies CS8 (Promoting a successful and inclusive Camden Economy) and CS19 (Delivering and monitoring the Core Strategy) of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Core Strategy.\r\n",
    "Reason : 11 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal Agreement securing financial contributions towards pedestrian and environmental improvements in the area, would fail to mitigate the impact of the development created by increased trips contrary to CS11 (Promoting sustainable and efficient travel) of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Core Strategy and policies DP16 (Transport implications of development), DP17 (Walking, cycling and public transport) and DP21 (Development connecting to the highway) of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Development Policies.\r\n",
    "Reason : 12 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement securing a contribution for public open space, would be likely to contribute to pressure and demand on the existing open space in this area, contrary to policies CS15 (Protecting and improving our parks and open spaces and encouraging biodiversity) and CS19 (Delivering and monitoring the Core Strategy) of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Core Strategy and policy DP31 of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Development Policies.\r\n",
    "Reason : 13 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement to secure necessary contributions towards pedestrian signage and way-finding improvements in the area, would fail to make sufficient provision in a sustainable manner for the increased trips generated by the development, contrary to policy CS11 (Promoting sustainable of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Core Strategy and policies DP16 (Transport implications of development) and DP17 (Walking, cycling and public transport) of the London Borough of Camden Local Development Framework Development Policies.\r\n"
