  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed mansard roof extension is unacceptable in principle, by virtue of its height, bulk, mass and detailed design and would compromise the form, proportions and integrity of the building and detract from the street scene particularly in long views given its prominent corner location, and therefore is contrary to Policies B1 (General Design Principles) and B3 (Alterations and Extensions) of the London Borough of Camden Replacement Unitary Development Plan 2006 and the advice contained within Camden Planning Guidance 2006.",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed first floor level self-contained studio flat by reason of its size (floorspace) would not provide acceptable living conditions, contrary to Policy H1 (New Housing) of the London Borough of Camden Replacement Unitary Development Plan 2006 and the advice contained within Camden Planning Guidance 2006. \r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed development fails to provide adequate on-site cycle storage facilities for the new residential units, contrary to Policy T3 (Pedestrians and Cycling) and Appendix 6 (Parking Standards) of the London Borough of Camden Replacement Unitary Development Plan 2006 and the advice contained within Camden Planning Guidance 2006.\r\n",
    "Reason : 4 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement to secure car-free housing for the new residential units, would be likely to contribute unacceptably to parking stress and congestion in the surrounding area contrary to Policies T8 (Car-free and car-capped housing) and T9 (Impact of parking) of the London Borough of Camden Replacement Unitary Development Plan 2006 and the advice contained within Camden Planning Guidance 2006.\r\n\r\n",
    "Reason : 5 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement securing contributions to Camden's Pedestrian, Environmental and Safety Improvement Initiative would be likely to contribute unacceptably to pressure on the Borough's transport infrastructure, contrary to Policy SD2 of the London Borough of Camden Replacement Unitary Development Plan 2006 and advice within Camden Planning Guidance 2006.\r\n",
    "Reason : 6 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement to secure the provision of a Construction Management Plan and Construction Delivery Plan, would be likely to contribute unacceptably to traffic disruption and dangerous situations for pedestrians and other road users contrary to Policy T12 (Works affecting highways) of the London Borough of Camden Replacement Unitary Development Plan 2006 and the advice contained within Camden Planning Guidance 2006.",
    "Reason : 7 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement securing public open space contributions, would be likely to contribute unacceptably to pressure on the Borough's open space facilities, contrary to Policy N4 (Providing Public Open Space) of the London Borough of Camden Replacement Unitary Development Plan 2006 and the advice contained within Camden Planning Guidance 2006.\r\n",
    "Reason : 8 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement requiring for that the new residential accommodation meet level 3 of the Code for Sustainable Homes would fail to be sustainable in its use of resources, contrary to Policy SD9 (Resources and Energy) of the London Borough of Camden Replacement Unitary Development Plan 2006 and to guidance within Camden Planning Guidance 2006.\r\n",
    "Reason : 9 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement to secure a financial contribution towards educational provision, would be likely to contribute to increased pressure and demand on the Borough's educational facilities contrary to policy SD2 (Planning Obligations) of the London Borough of Camden Replacement Unitary Development Plan 2006 and the advice contained within the Camden Planning Guidance 2006.   \r\n"
