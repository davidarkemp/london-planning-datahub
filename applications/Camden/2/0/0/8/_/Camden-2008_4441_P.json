    "Condition : 2 - A Sample panel of the facing materials demonstrating the proposed colour, texture, and glazing shall be provided on site and approved by the Council before the relevant parts of the works are commenced and the development shall be carried out in accordance with the approval given. The sample panel shall be retained on site until the work has been completed.\r\n\r\nReason: To safeguard the appearance of the premises and the character of the immediate area in accordance with the requirements of policies S1, S2, B1 and B6 of the London Borough of Camden Replacement Unitary Development Plan 2006.\r\n",
    "Condition : 3 - All trees on the site, or parts of trees growing from adjoining sites, unless shown on the permitted drawings as being removed, shall be retained and protected from damage to the satisfaction of the Council. Details shall be submitted to and approved by the Council before works commence on site to demonstrate how trees to be retained shall be protected during construction work: such details shall follow guidelines and standards set out in BS5837:2005 \"Trees in Relation to Construction\r\n\r\nReason: To ensure that the Council may be satisfied that the development will not have an adverse effect on existing trees and in order to maintain the character and amenities of the area in accordance with the requirements of policies N8 of the London Borough of Camden Replacement Unitary Development Plan 2006.\r\n",
    "Condition : 4 - Before the development commences, details of the proposed cycle storage area for 1 cycle shall be submitted to and approved by the Council.
