  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development would have an unacceptable impact upon the setting of the Grade II listed terraces at 10-18 Woburn Square and 55-59 Gordon Square as a result of the proposed development's excessive height and scale, close proximity to the listed terraces, incongruous design and overall discordant relationship with the listed terraces. The proposal would thereby be contrary to Policies B6, B1 and B3 of the Adopted Replacement Camden Unitary Development Plan 2006, Camden Planning Guidance 2006 and Planning Policy Guidance Note 15 (Planning and the Historic Environment).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement to secure local pedestrian/cycling and environmental improvements and a travel plan, would generate additional trips (some of which would be likely to be by private motor vehicle) that would be unsustainable and would place additional stress on the local transport infrastrucure with no measures or strategies to reduce or ameliorate such impacts. The proposal would thereby be contrary to Policies SD2, T1, T2, T3, T4 and T5 of the Adopted Replacement Camden Unitary Development Plan 2006 and Camden Planning Guidance 2006.  ",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement to secure a Construction Management Plan, would cause significant disruption to the satisfactory and safe operation of the public highway and to the amenities of adjoining occupiers and the area. The proposal would thereby be contrary to Policies SD2, SD6, SD8 and T12 of the Adopted Replacement Camden Unitary Development Plan 2006 and Camden Planning Guidance 2006.",
    "Reason : 4 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement to secure a Service Management Plan, would not have a strategy to prevent the traffic and other activities associated with the servicing needs of the development from causing serious disruption to the maintenance of the satisfactory and safe operation of the public highway around the development site. The proposal would thereby be contrary to Policies SD2 and T12 of the Adopted Replacement Camden Unitary Development Plan 2006 and Camden Planning Guidance 2006.",
    "Reason : 5 - The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement to secure a  Water Strategy Plan; BREEAM assessment; Energy Plan; and Waste and Resorces Action Programme (WRAP), would fail to employ principles of sustainability in the use of water, construction and design, plus energy and resources which would cause the development to have unsustainable impact upon the environment. The proposal would thereby be contrary to Policies SD2, SD9 and SD12 of Adopted Replacement Camden Unitary Development Plan 2006 and Camden Planning Guidance 2006."
