In particular, the shopfront shall be timber framed.\r\n\r\nReason: To safeguard the appearance of the premises and the character of the immediate area in accordance with the requirements of policies EN1, EN13 and EN31 of the London Borough of Camden Unitary Development Plan 2000.\r\n",
    "Condition : 3 - No development shall take place until full details of hard and soft landscaping and means of enclosure of all un-built, open areas have been submitted to and approved by the Council and shall be subsequently maintained as such.  [Such details shall include details of all planting, the railings above the single storey extension on the site of no. 126 and the new gates at the rear of the site, together with any alterations to the rear boundary wall that are required in association with the provision of the gates].  \r\n\r\nReason: To enable the Council to ensure a reasonable standard of visual amenity in the scheme in accordance with the requirements of policies EN15 and EN35 of the London Borough of Camden Unitary Development Plan 2000.\r\n",
