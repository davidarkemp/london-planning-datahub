  "decision_conditions": [
    "Condition : 1 - Details of the design of building foundations and the layout, with dimensions and levels, of service trenches and other excavations on site in so far as these items may affect trees on or adjoining the site, shall be submitted to and approved by the Council as the local planning authority before any works on site are commenced.\r\n\r\nReason: To ensure that the Council may be satisfied that the development will not have an adverse effect on existing trees and in order to maintain the character and amenities of the area in accordance with the requirements of policies EN61 and EN35 of the London Borough of Camden Unitary Development Plan 2000.\r\n",
    "Condition : 2 - No development shall commence before a contract has been entered into with the local highway authority to secure: a) the reinstatement of a level public footway, by removing the existing vehicle crossover and dropped kerb and b) the installation of a resident's parking bay on the carriageway immediately adjacent to the reinstated footway. The new dwellinghouse hereby permitted shall not be occupied until the works that are the subject of that contract have been completed.\r\n\r\nReason: To ensure that a) the pedestrian environment is improved in accordance with policy TR21 by the removal of the unneccesary vehicle crossover and b) that an additional on-street parking bay is created to mitigate any detrimental impact on parking controls (in accordance with policy TR11) caused by removing existing off-street carparking. \r\n",
    "Condition : 3 - The development hereby permitted must be begun not later than the end of three years from the date of this permission.\r\n\r\nReason: In order to comply with the provisions of Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended).\r\n",
    "Condition : 4 - The details of facing materials, window framing, and front boundary treatments to be used on the building shall not be otherwise than as shall have been submitted to and approved by the Council before any work is commenced on the relevant part of the development. The development shall not be carried out otherwise than in accordance with the details thus approved.\r\n\r\nReason: To safeguard the appearance of the premises and the character of the immediate area in accordance with the requirements of policies EN1, EN13, EN14, EN18 and EN31 of the London Borough of Camden Unitary Development Plan 2000.\r\n",
    "Condition : 5 - All trees on the site, or parts of trees growing from adjoining sites, unless shown on the permitted drawings as being removed, shall be retained and protected from damage to the satisfaction of the Council for a period of at least 5 years following the completion of the development hereby approved, or such longer period as may be required under Sections 198 and 211 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990. [In particular, details shall be submitted to the Council before works commence on site to demonstrate how the trees shall be protected during construction work: such details shall for instance include measures to protect the tree trunk, to prevent additional soil compaction around the root zone, and to reduce damage to the lower branches including any proposals for crown uplifting.]\r\n\r\nReason: To ensure that the Council may be satisfied that the development will not have an adverse effect on existing trees and in order to maintain the character and amenities of the area in accordance with the requirements of policies EN61 and EN35 of the London Borough of Camden Unitary Development Plan 2000.\r\n",
    "Condition : 6 - No development shall take place until details have been submitted to the Council demonstrating how green and brown roofs are incorporated into the development on the proposed flat roof areas. The approved details shall be implemented in their entirety in accordance with the details thus approved, and thereafter permanently maintained and retained as such.     \r\n\r\nReason:  So that the Council can be satisfied that the scheme has considered conserving and enhacing biodiversity and has implemented measures in order to achieve compliance with policy Nnew (Biodiversity) of the Proposed Modifications to the Revised Deposit Draft [as approved by the Council's Executive on 11th January 2006].  \r\n",
    "Condition : 7 - The proposed dwelling hereby approved shall incorporate a system to allow for rainwater to be stored for re-use within the building and provisions made for grey water recycling.  \r\n\r\nReason:  So that the Council can be satisfied that the scheme has made adequate provision for water supply and waste treatment in order to achieve compliance with policy SD9 of the Proposed Modifications to the Revised Deposit Draft [as approved by the Council's Executive on 11th January 2006].  \r\n"
