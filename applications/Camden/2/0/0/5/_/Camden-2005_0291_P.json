    "Condition : 2 - The details of the elevations and facing materials (including revised details of the front and rear balconies and of the ground floor shopfront and hostel entrance) to be used on the building and new refuse store shall not be otherwise than as shall have been submitted to and approved by the Council before any work is commenced on the relevant part of the development. These parts of the development shall not be carried out otherwise than in accordance with the details thus approved.\r\n\r\nReason: To safeguard the appearance of the premises and the character of the immediate area in accordance with the requirements of policies EN1 and EN13 of the London Borough of Camden Unitary Development Plan 2000.\r\n",

In particular a maximum of one carspace shall be reserved for the Class A1/B1 unit and the remainder shall only be for the hostel use.\r\n\r\nReason: To ensure that the use of the premises does not add to parking pressures in surrounding streets which would be contrary to policies RE2 and TR17 of the London Borough of Camden Unitary Development Plan 2000.\r\n",
    "Condition : 6 - The hostel units on the ground-4th floors hereby approved shall only be occupied for a minimum period of one calendar month in conjunction with the overall use of the basement, part ground and 1st-4th floors as a \"sui generis\" hostel with communal facilities and they shall not be used as Class C1 hotel suites.\r\n\r\nReason: To ensure that the future occupation of the building shall be in accordance with the intentions of the proposed scheme and with the Council's policy for hostel uses as set out in policy HG22 of the London Borough of Camden Unitary Development Plan 2000."
