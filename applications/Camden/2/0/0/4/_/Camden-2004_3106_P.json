    "Condition : 1 - The development hereby permitted must be begun not later than the end of five years from the date of this permission.\r\n\r\nReason: In order to comply with the provisions of Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended).\r\n",
    "Condition : 2 - The details of the elevations and facing materials to be used on the building shall not be otherwise than as shall have been submitted to and approved by the Council before any work is commenced on the relevant part of the development. Thereafter, these parts of the development shall not be carried out otherwise than in accordance with the details thus approved.\r\n\r\nReason: To safeguard the appearance of the premises and the character of the immediate area in accordance with the requirements of policies EN1, EN13 and EN31 of the London Borough of Camden Unitary Development Plan 2000.\r\n",
    "Condition : 3 - No development shall take place until full details of hard and soft landscaping and means of enclosure of all unbuilt open areas, including the ramp and open access area between the proposed house and entrance gates to Gayton Road, have been submitted to and approved by the Council. Such details shall also include the proposed species of planting and design of planter boxes  for the lavender bed planting on the proposed roof, and the proposed irrigation and drainage strategy for this roof planting.  \r\n\r\nReason: To enable the Council to ensure a reasonable standard of visual amenity in the scheme in accordance with the requirements of policies EN15 and EN35 of the London Borough of Camden Unitary Development Plan 2000.\r\n",
    "Condition : 4 - All trees on the site, or parts of trees growing from adjoining sites, unless shown on the permitted drawings as being removed, shall be retained and protected from damage to the satisfaction of the Council for a period of at least 5 years following the completion of the development hereby approved, or such longer period as may be required under Sections 198 and 211 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990. In particular, details shall be submitted to the Council before works commence on site to demonstrate how the ash tree at the rear of 28 Hampstead High Street shall be protected during construction work: such details shall for instance include measures to protect the tree trunk, to prevent additional soil compaction around the root zone, and to reduce damage to the lower branches including any proposals for crown uplifting.\r\n\r\nReason: To ensure that the Council may be satisfied that the development will not have an adverse effect on existing trees and in order to maintain the character and amenities of the area in accordance with the requirements of policies EN61 and EN35  of the London Borough of Camden Unitary Development Plan 2000.\r\n",
    "Condition : 5 - All hard and soft landscaping works, including the lavender beds on the proposed roof, shall be carried out to a reasonable standard in accordance with the approved landscape details by not later than the end of the planting season following completion of the development or any phase of the development, whichever is the sooner. Any trees or areas of planting which, within a period of 5 years from the completion of the development, die, are removed or become seriously damaged or diseased, shall be replaced as soon as is reasonably possible and, in any case, by not later than the end of the following planting season, with others of similar size and species, unless the Council gives written consent to any variation.\r\n\r\nReason: To ensure that the landscaping is carried out within a reasonable period and to maintain a satisfactory standard of visual amenity in the scheme in accordance with the requirements of policies EN15 and EN35 of the London Borough of Camden Unitary Development Plan 2000.\r\n",
    "Condition : 6 - Details of the design of building foundations and the layout, with dimensions and levels, of service trenches and other excavations on site in so far as these items may affect trees on or adjoining the site, shall be submitted to and approved by the Council as the local planning authority before any works on site are commenced.\r\n\r\nReason: To ensure that the Council may be satisfied that the development will not have an adverse effect on existing trees and in order to maintain the character and amenities of the area in accordance with the requirements of policies EN61 and EN35 of the London Borough of Camden Unitary Development Plan 2000.\r\n",
    "Condition : 7 - No development shall take place until:\r\na)\tThe applicant has submitted a programme of ground investigation for the presence of soil and groundwater contamination and landfill gas for approval by the Council; and\r\nb)\tThe investigation has been carried out in accordance with the approved details and the results and remediation measures (if necessary) have been submitted to and approved by the Council. All approved remediation measures shall be implemented strictly in accordance with the approved details.\r\n\r\nReason: To protect future occupiers of the development from the possible presence of ground contamination arising in connection with the previous industrial/storage use of the site in accordance with policy EN10 of the London Borough of Camden Unitary Development Plan 2000.\r\n",
    "Condition : 8 - The development shall not be occupied until the whole of the car parking provision shown on the approved drawings is provided. Thereafter, the whole of the car parking provision shall be retained and used for no purpose other than for the parking of vehicles of the occupiers and users of the development.\r\n\r\nReason: To ensure that the use of the premises does not add to parking pressures in surrounding streets which would be contrary to policies RE2 and TR17 of the London Borough of Camden Unitary Development Plan 2000.\r\n",
    "Condition : 9 - Notwithstanding the provisions of Article 3 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted  Development Order) 1995 or any Order revoking  and re-enacting that Order, no development within Part 1 (Classes A-H) and Part 2 (Classes A-C) of Schedule 2 of that Order shall be carried out without the grant of planning permission having first been obtained from the Council.\r\n\r\nReason: To safeguard the visual amenities of the area and to prevent over development of the site by controlling proposed extensions and alterations\r\nin order to ensure compliance with the requirements of policies EN1, EN13 and EN19 of the London Borough of Camden Unitary Development Plan 2000.\r\n",
