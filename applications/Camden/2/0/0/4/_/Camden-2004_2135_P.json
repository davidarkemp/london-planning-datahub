    "Reason : 1 - The proposed two-storey dwelling house, by reason of its detailed design, siting, height, size, footprint, location and bulk would result in the diminution of an existing gap which would be inappropriate and would detract from the setting and appearance of the adjoining buildings particularly at 38 St. Paul's Crescent. The proposal would have a detrimental impact on long views to and from St. Paul's Crescent. The proposal would not preserve or enhance the character and appearance of the Camden Square conservation area and would therefore be contrary to policies EN1 (General environmental protection and improvement), EN13 (Design of new development), EN14 (Setting of new development), EN18 (Design of infill developments), and EN31 (Character and appearance of conservation area) of Unitary Development Plan 2000.\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed dwelling, having all its windows facing north-east would have a poor level of amenity due to inadequate light and outlook and would be contrary to policy EN19 (Amenity for occupiers and neighbours) and Supplementary Planning Guidance on internal design, layout, lighting and ventilation.\r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed development makes no provision for off-street car parking contrary to policy TR17 (Parking standards) of the London Borough of Camden Unitary Development Plan 2000.\r\n",
    "Reason : 4 - The non-provision of outside amenity space would fail to provide sufficiently for the requirements of future occupiers and the surrounding area both in terms of general living conditions and storage of refuse and is contrary to policies RE2 (Residential amenity and environment), EN1 (General environmental protection and improvement) and HG13 (Provision of amenity space) of the London Borough of Camden Unitary Development Plan 2000.\r\n"
