    "Condition : 1 - The development hereby permitted must be begun not later than the end of five years from the date of this permission.\r\n\r\nReason: In order to comply with the provisions of Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended).\r\n",
    "Condition : 2 - The details of the materials to be used on the roof, door, windows, balcony and framing system on the first floor glazing shall not be otherwise than as shall have been submitted to and approved by the Council before any work is commenced on the relevant part of the development.  These parts of the development shall not be carried out otherwise than in accordance with the details thus approved.\r\n\r\nReason: To safeguard the appearance of the premises and the character of the immediate area in accordance with the requirements of policies EN1 and EN13 and EN31 of the London Borough of Camden Unitary Development Plan 2000.\r\n",
    "Condition : 3 - All hard and soft landscaping works shall be carried out to a reasonable standard in accordance with the approved landscape details by not later than the end of the planting season following completion of the development, prior to the occupation for the permitted use of the development. Any trees or areas of planting which, within a period of 5 years from the completion of the development, die, are removed or become seriously damaged or diseased, shall be replaced as soon as is reasonably possible and, in any case, by not later than the end of the following planting season, with others of similar size and species, unless the Council gives written consent to any variation.\r\n\r\nReason: To ensure that the landscaping is carried out within a reasonable period and to maintain a satisfactory standard of visual amenity in the scheme in accordance with the requirements of policies EN15 and EN35 of the London Borough of Camden Unitary Development Plan 2000.\r\n",
    "Condition : 4 - The lime tree on the site, or any parts of trees growing from adjoining sites, unless shown on the permitted drawings as being removed, shall be retained and protected from damage to the satisfaction of the Council for a period of at least 5 years following the completion of the development hereby approved, or such longer period as may be required under Sections 198 and 211 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990. In particular, details shall be submitted to the Council before works commence on site to demonstrate how the lime tree on the north east corner of the site shall be protected during construction work: such details shall for instance include measures to protect the tree trunk, to prevent additional soil compaction around the root zone, and to reduce damage to the lower branches including any proposals for crown uplifting.\r\n\r\nReason: To ensure that the Council may be satisfied that the development will not have an adverse effect on existing trees and in order to maintain the character and amenities of the area in accordance with the requirements of policies EN61 and EN35 of the London Borough of Camden Unitary Development Plan 2000.\r\n",
    "Condition : 5 - No development shall take place until an appropriate site investigation is undertaken by the applicant regarding ground and water contamination on site and the possible presence of asbestos in the buildings to be demolished. A report, including any recommendations for remediation works, shall be submitted for the Council's approval  and any remediation works shall be implemented as approved before construction works commence on site.\r\n\r\nReason: In order to protect the amenity of the occupants of the building in accordance with the requirements of policy RE2 and EN10 of the London Borough of Camden Unitary Development Plan 2000.\r\n",
    "Condition : 6 - Notwithstanding the provisions of Article 3 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted  Development Order) 1995 or any Order revoking  and re-enacting that Order, no development within Part 1 (Classes A-H) of Schedule 2 of that Order shall be carried out without the grant of planning permission having first been obtained from the Council.\r\n\r\nReason: To safeguard the visual amenities of the area and to prevent over development of the site by controlling proposed extensions and alterations in order to ensure compliance with the requirements of policies EN1, EN13, EN31 and EN19 of the London Borough of Camden Unitary Development Plan 2000.\r\n"
