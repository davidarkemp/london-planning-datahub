  "decision_conditions": [
    "Condition : 1 - The development hereby permitted must be begun not later than the end of five years from the date of this permission.\r\n\r\nReason: In order to comply with the provisions of Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended).\r\n",
    "Condition : 2 - The details of the sections, elevations and facing materials to be used on the building shall not be otherwise than as shall have been submitted to and approved by the Council before any work is commenced on the relevant part of the development. Such details shall include proposed slab levels of the building in relation to the existing and proposed levels of the site and the surrounding land. Thereafter, these parts of the development shall not be carried out otherwise than in accordance with the details thus approved.\r\n\r\nReason: To safeguard the appearance of the premises and the character of the immediate area in accordance with the requirements of policies EN1, EN13 and EN31 of the London Borough of Camden Unitary Development Plan 2000.\r\n",
    "Condition : 3 - Sample panels of the facing brickwork demonstrating the proposed colour, texture, face-bond and pointing shall be provided on site and approved by the Council before the relevant parts of the works are commenced and, thereafter,  the development shall be carried out in accordance with the approval given. The sample panel shall be retained on site until the work has been completed.\r\n\r\nReason: To safeguard the appearance of the premises and the character of the immediate area in accordance with the requirements of policies EN1, EN13 and EN31 of the London Borough of Camden Unitary Development Plan 2000.\r\n",
    "Condition : 4 - Notwithstanding the details shown on the drawings hereby approved, no development shall take place until full details of hard and soft landscaping and means of enclosure of all un-built, open areas have been submitted to and approved by the Council. Such details shall include details of any proposed earthworks including grading, mounding and other changes in ground levels. \r\n\r\nReason: To enable the Council to ensure a reasonable standard of visual amenity in the scheme in accordance with the requirements of policies EN15,  EN61 and EN35 of the London Borough of Camden Unitary Development Plan 2000.\r\n",
    "Condition : 5 - All hard and soft landscaping works shall be carried out to a reasonable standard in accordance with the approved landscape details, prior to the occupation for the permitted use of the development or any phase of the development, whichever is the sooner. Any trees or areas of planting which, within a period of 5 years from the completion of the development, die, are removed or become seriously damaged or diseased, shall be replaced as soon as is reasonably possible and, in any case, by not later than the end of the following planting season, with others of similar size and species, unless the Council gives written consent to any variation.\r\n\r\nReason: To ensure that the landscaping is carried out within a reasonable period and to maintain a satisfactory standard of visual amenity in the scheme in accordance with the requirements of policies EN15 and EN35 of the London Borough of Camden Unitary Development Plan 2000.\r\n",
    "Condition : 6 - Details of the design of building foundations and the layout, with dimensions and levels, of service trenches and other excavations on site in so far as these items may affect trees on or adjoining the site, shall be submitted to and approved by the Council as the local planning authority before any works on site are commenced.\r\n\r\nReason: To ensure that the Council may be satisfied that the development will not have an adverse effect on existing trees and in order to maintain the character and amenities of the area in accordance with the requirements of policies EN61 and EN35 of the London Borough of Camden Unitary Development Plan 2000.\r\n",
    "Condition : 7 - All trees on the site, or parts of trees growing from adjoining sites, unless shown on the permitted drawings as being removed, shall be retained and protected from damage to the satisfaction of the Council for a period of at least 5 years following the completion of the development hereby approved, or such longer period as may be required under Sections 198 and 211 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990. In particular, notwithstanding the details shown on the drawings hereby approved, revised details shall be submitted to the Council before works commence on site to demonstrate how the mature trees on the site and overhanging from adjoining sites shall be protected during construction work: such details shall for instance include measures to protect the tree trunk, to prevent additional soil compaction around the root zone, and to reduce damage to the lower branches including any proposals for crown uplifting.\r\n\r\nReason: To ensure that the Council may be satisfied that the development will not have an adverse effect on existing trees and in order to maintain the character and amenities of the area in accordance with the requirements of policies EN61 and EN35 of the London Borough of Camden Unitary Development Plan 2000.\r\n",
    "Condition : 8 - Obscure glazing, details of which shall have been submitted to and approved by the Council, shall be installed on the 3 x 1st floor windows of the master bedroom/dressing room on the southeast elevation facing the adjoining site at no. 1 Radlett Place prior to the first occupation of the dwellinghouse hereby approved, and it shall be thereafter permanently retained and maintained as such.\r\n\r\nReason: In order to prevent unreasonable overlooking of neighbouring premises in accordance with the requirements of policies EN1 and EN19 of the London Borough of Camden Unitary Development Plan 2000.\r\n",
    "Condition : 9 - The development shall not be occupied until the whole of the car parking provision shown on the approved drawings is provided. Thereafter, the whole of the car parking provision shall be retained and used for no purpose other than for the parking of vehicles of the occupiers and users of the development.\r\n\r\nReason: To ensure that the use of the premises does not add to parking pressures in surrounding streets which would be contrary to policies RE2 and TR17 of the London Borough of Camden Unitary Development Plan 2000.\r\n",
    "Condition : 10 - Notwithstanding the provisions of Article 3 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted  Development Order) 1995 or any Order revoking and re-enacting that Order, no development within Part 1 (Classes A-H) and Part 2 (Classes A-C) of Schedule 2 of that Order shall be carried out without the grant of planning permission having first been obtained from the Council.\r\n\r\nReason: To safeguard the amenities of adjoining occupiers, the visual amenities of the area and the character and appearance of this part of the conservation area, and to prevent over development of the site by controlling proposed extensions and alterations in order to ensure compliance with the requirements of policies EN1, EN13, EN19 and EN31 of the London Borough of Camden Unitary Development Plan 2000.\r\n"
