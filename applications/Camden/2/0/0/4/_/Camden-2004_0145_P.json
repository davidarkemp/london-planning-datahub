    "Condition : 2 - The details of the facing materials, fenestration and glazed screens to be used on the building shall not be otherwise than as shall have been submitted to and approved by the Council before any work is commenced on the relevant part of the development. These parts of the development shall not be carried out otherwise than in accordance with the details thus approved.\r\n\r\nReason: To safeguard the appearance of the premises and the character of the immediate area in accordance with the requirements of policies EN1 and EN13  of the London Borough of Camden Unitary Development Plan 2000.\r\n",
    "Condition : 3 - No sound emanating from the Class B1 studio use at rear ground floor level shall be audible within any adjoining premises between 2300 hrs and 0700 hrs.\r\n\r\nReason: To safeguard the amenities of the adjoining premises and the area generally in accordance with the requirements of policy RE2, EN5, EN6 and DS6  of the London Borough of Camden Unitary Development Plan 2000.\r\n",
    "Condition : 4 - The use of the rear upper ground, 1st and 2nd floor roofs as terraces shall not commence until the screens, as shown on the approved drawings, have been constructed with obscure glazing and they shall be permanently retained and maintained thereafter. \r\n\r\nReason: In order to prevent unreasonable overlooking of neighbouring premises in accordance with the requirements of policies EN1 and EN19 of the London Borough of Camden Unitary Development Plan 2000.\r\n",
    "Condition : 5 - No development shall take place until full details of hard and soft landscaping and means of enclosure of the front garden have been submitted to and approved by the Council. \r\n\r\nReason: To enable the Council to ensure a reasonable standard of visual amenity in the scheme in accordance with the requirements of policy EN15 of the London Borough of Camden Unitary Development Plan 2000.\r\n",
    "Condition : 6 - All hard and soft landscaping works shall be carried out to a reasonable standard in accordance with the approved landscape details by not later than the end of the planting season following completion of the development or any phase of the development, whichever is the sooner. Any trees or areas of planting which, within a period of 5 years from the completion of the development, die, are removed or become seriously damaged or diseased, shall be replaced as soon as is reasonably possible and, in any case, by not later than the end of the following planting season, with others of similar size and species, unless the Council gives written consent to any variation.\r\n\r\nReason: To ensure that the landscaping is carried out within a reasonable period and to maintain a satisfactory standard of visual amenity in the scheme in accordance with the requirements of policy EN15 of the London Borough of Camden Unitary Development Plan 2000.\r\n",
    "Condition : 7 - The development shall not be occupied until the whole of the car parking provision shown on the approved drawings is provided. Thereafter the whole of the car parking provision shall be retained and used for no purpose other than for the parking of vehicles of the occupiers and users of the residential element of the development.\r\n\r\nReason: To ensure that the use of the premises does not add to parking pressures in surrounding streets which would be contrary to policies RE2 and TR17 of the London Borough of Camden Unitary Development Plan 2000.\r\n"
