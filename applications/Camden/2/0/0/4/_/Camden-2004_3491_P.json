    "Condition : 1 - The development hereby permitted must be begun not later than the end of five years from the date of this permission.\r\n\r\nReason: In order to comply with the provisions of Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended).\r\n",
    "Condition : 2 - All joinery used in the construction of the windows/doors of the houses hereby permitted shall be timber, which shall be permanently retained as such thereafter.\r\n\r\nReason: To ensure that the development has a suitable appearance for its surroundings and is sustainable in accordance with the requirements of Policies EN1, EN13 and EN12 of the London Borough of Camden Unitary Development Plan 2000. \r\n",
    "Condition : 3 - All trees on the site, or parts of trees growing from adjoining sites, unless shown on the permitted drawings as being removed, shall be retained and protected from damage to the satisfaction of the Council for a period of at least 5 years following the completion of the development hereby approved, or such longer period as may be required under Sections 198 and 211 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990. In particular, details shall be submitted to the Council before works commence on site to demonstrate how the Cedar tree on the Shoot Up Hill road frontage shall be protected during construction work: such details shall for instance include measures to protect the tree trunk, to prevent additional soil compaction around the root zone, and to reduce damage to the lower branches including any proposals for crown uplifting.\r\n\r\nReason: To ensure that the Council may be satisfied that the development will not have an adverse effect on existing trees and in order to maintain the character and amenities of the area in accordance with the requirements of policies EN61 of the London Borough of Camden Unitary Development Plan 2000.\r\n",
    "Condition : 4 - No development shall take place until full details of hard and soft landscaping and means of enclosure of all un-built, open areas have been submitted to and approved by the Council. Such details shall include details of any proposed earthworks including grading, mounding and other changes in ground levels. \r\n\r\nReason: To enable the Council to ensure a reasonable standard of visual amenity in the scheme in accordance with the requirements of policies EN15, and EN61 of the London Borough of Camden Unitary Development Plan 2000.\r\n",
    "Condition : 5 - All hard and soft landscaping works shall be carried out to a reasonable standard in accordance with the approved landscape details by not later than the end of the planting season following completion of the development or any phase of the development, whichever is the sooner. Any trees or areas of planting which, within a period of 5 years from the completion of the development, die, are removed or become seriously damaged or diseased, shall be replaced as soon as is reasonably possible and, in any case, by not later than the end of the following planting season, with others of similar size and species, unless the Council gives written consent to any variation.\r\n\r\nReason: To ensure that the landscaping is carried out within a reasonable period and to maintain a satisfactory standard of visual amenity in the scheme in accordance with the requirements of policies EN15 and EN61 of the London Borough of Camden Unitary Development Plan 2000.\r\n",
    "Condition : 6 - No part of the development shall not be occupied until the whole of the car parking provision shown on the approved drawings is provided. Thereafter, the whole of the car parking provision shall be retained and used for no purpose other than for the parking of vehicles of the occupiers and users of the development.\r\n\r\nReason: To ensure that the use of the premises does not add to parking pressures in surrounding streets which would be contrary to policies RE2 and TR17 of the London Borough of Camden Unitary Development Plan 2000.\r\n",
    "Condition : 7 - Notwithstanding the provisions of Article 3, Schedule 2, Part 1, Class A of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 1995 (including any Order revoking or reenacting that Order, with or without modification), no window door or other means of opening shall be inserted on the elevation facing 36 Shoot Up Hill of the building hereby permitted in addition to those shown on drawing number 4782/32A.\r\n\r\nReason: To enable the Local Planning Authority to retain adequate control over fenestration on the rear elevation in the interests of the privacy of neighbouring occupiers in accordance with the requirements of Policy EN19 of the London Borough of Camden Unitary Development Plan 2000.\r\n",
    "Condition : 8 - The windows facing no. 36 Shoot Up Hill on the elevation of the building hereby approved shall be constructed and installed in strict accordance with the details shown on the 'special window diagram' [approved drawing number 4782/15D] and they shall thereafter be permanently mainatined and retained in this form.\r\n\r\nReason: To enable the Local Planning Authority to retain adequate control over fenestration on the rear elevation in the interests of the privacy of neighbouring occupiers in accordance with the requirements of Policy EN19 of the London Borough of Camden Unitary Development Plan 2000.\r\n"
