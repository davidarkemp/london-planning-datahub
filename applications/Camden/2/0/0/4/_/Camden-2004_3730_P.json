    "Condition : 2 - The details of the windows, dormer, roof lights, exterior panelling and front entrance door to be used on the building shall not be otherwise than as shall have been submitted to and approved by the Council before any work is commenced on the relevant part of the development. Thereafter, these parts of the development shall not be carried out otherwise than in accordance with the details thus approved.\r\n\r\nReason: To safeguard the appearance of the premises and the character of the immediate area in accordance with the requirements of policies EN1, EN13 and EN31 of the London Borough of Camden Unitary Development Plan 2000.\r\n",

The sample panel shall be retained on site until the work has been completed.\r\n\r\nReason: To safeguard the appearance of the premises and the character of the immediate area in accordance with the requirements of policies EN1, EN13 and EN31 of the London Borough of Camden Unitary Development Plan 2000.\r\n",
    "Condition : 4 - The flat roofs over the first floor shall not be used as roof terraces.\r\n\r\nReason: In  order to prevent unreasonable overlooking of neighbouring premises in accordance with the requirements of policies EN1 and EN19 of the London Borough of Camden Unitary Development Plan 2000.\r\n",
    "Condition : 5 - Notwithstanding the provisions of Article 3 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted  Development Order) 1995 or any Order revoking  and re-enacting that Order, no development within Part 1 (Classes A, C and H) of Schedule 2 of that Order shall be carried out without the grant of planning permission having first been obtained from the Council.\r\n\r\nReason: To safeguard the visual amenities of the area by controlling proposed  alterations in order to ensure compliance with the requirements of policies EN1, EN13 and EN19 of the London Borough of Camden Unitary Development Plan 2000.\r\n",
