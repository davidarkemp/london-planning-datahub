    "Condition : 2 - Before the development commences, details of the proposed cycle storage area for  7 cycles for staff and 8 for visitors shall be submitted to and approved by the Council. The approved facility shall thereafter be provided in its entirety prior to the first occupation of any of the new units, and thereafter permanently maintained and retained.\r\n\r\nReason: To ensure the development provides adequate cycle parking facilities in accordance with the requirements of policy T3 of the London Borough of Camden Replacement Unitary Development Plan 2006.\r\n",
    "Condition : 3 - Notwithstanding the provision of Class D1 of the Schedule of the Town and Country planning (Use Classes) Order, 1987, or any provision equivalent to that Class in any statutory instrument revoking and re-enacting that Order, the lower ground and/or ground floor of the building shall only be used as a medical centre and for no other purpose within that use class.\r\n\r\nReason: To ensure that the future occupation of the building does not adversely affect the amenity of the adjoining premises/immediate area by reason of noise generation, additional traffic movement and congestion and excessive on-street parking pressure in accordance with policies SD6 of the London Borough of Camden Replacement Unitary Development Plan 2006.",
    "Condition : 4 - Prior to construction submit a plan demonstrating how the development will feasibly minimise its carbon dioxide emissions through energy efficient measures, connecting to an efficient energy supply, generating energy efficiently and installing renewable energy technologies that is to be approved by the LPA. The agreed measures shall be installed prior to occupation and retained or upgraded there after.\r\n \r\nReason: In order to secure the optimum energy and resource efficiency measures and on-site renewable energy generation in accordance policy SD9C of the London Borough of Camden Replacement Unitary Development Plan 2006, The London Plan (Consolidated with Alterations Since 2004) and Camden Planning Guidance 2006.\r\n",
    "Condition : 5 - The development shall not be beneficially occupied until details of the proposed parking spaces, including disabled parking, have been submitted to, and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority. The approved parking shall thereafter be maintained and retained in accordance with the approved details. \r\n\r\nReason: To ensure that the use of the premises does not add to parking pressures in surrounding streets, which would be contrary to policies SD6 and T7 of the London Borough of Camden Replacement Unitary Development Plan 2006.\r\n"
