Details of such equipment shall include scale floor plans and sections showing the internal layout of the plant room, manufacturer's specifications and acoustic information including any required means of attenuation or isolation so as to minimise air and structure borne sound (e.g. acoustic screens). The acoustic report should address the cumulative noise levels of all the existing and proposed air conditioning units/plant.  All equipment shall thereafter be operated and maintained in effective order to the reasonable satisfaction of the Council.\r\n\r\nReason: To safeguard the amenities of the neighbouring premises in accordance with the requirements of policies SD6 (Amenity for Occupiers and Neighbours), SD7 (Light, noise and vibration pollution), SD8 (Noise and disturbance) and Appendix 1 (Noise and vibration thresholds) of the London Borough of Camden Replacement Unitary Development Plan 2006.\r\n",
