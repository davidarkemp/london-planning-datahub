    "Condition : 8 - All parts of trees growing from the adjoining pavement shall be retained and protected from damage to the satisfaction of the Council. \r\n\r\nReason: To ensure that the Council may be satisfied that the development will not have an adverse effect on existing trees and in order to maintain the character and amenities of the area in accordance with the requirements of policy N8 of the London Borough of Camden Replacement Unitary Development Plan 2006.\r\n",
    "Condition : 9 - No development shall take place until full details of hard and soft landscaping and means of enclosure of all un-built, open areas have been submitted to and approved by the Council. \r\n\r\nReason: To enable the Council to ensure a reasonable standard of visual amenity in the scheme in accordance with the requirements of policy B1 of the London Borough of Camden Replacement Unitary Development Plan 2006.\r\n",
