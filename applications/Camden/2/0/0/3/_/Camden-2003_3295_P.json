  "decision_conditions": [
    "Condition : 1 - The development hereby permitted must be begun not later than the end of five years from the date of this permission.\r\n\r\nReason: In order to comply with the provisions of Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended).\r\n",
    "Condition : 2 - All of the roof lights hereby approved shall be 'conservation type' roof lights, installed flush with the slope of the roof.\r\n\r\nReason: To ensure that the Council may be satisfied with the external appearance of the building in accordance with the requirements of policies EN1, EN13, and EN31 of the London Borough of Camden Unitary Development Plan 2000.\r\n",
    "Condition : 3 - Detailed drawings at a scale of 1:5 of the proposed round windows in the front and side gables, shall be submitted for the Council's approval before any work on site is commenced. The windows shall thereafter be provided in strict accordance with the approved details.\r\n\r\nReason : To ensure that the Council may be satisfied with the external appearance of the building in accordance with the requirements of policies EN1, EN13 and EN31 of the London Borough of Camden Unitary Development Plan 2000.\r\n",
    "Condition : 4 - All new external work shall be carried out in materials that resemble, as closely as possible, in colour and texture those of the existing building, unless otherwise specified in the approved application.\r\n\r\nReason: To safeguard the appearance of the premises and the character of the immediate area in accordance with the requirements of policies EN1,  EN13 and EN31 of the London Borough of Camden Unitary Development Plan 2000.\r\n",
    "Condition : 5 - The proposed two roof lights on the east side of the roof, corresponding to the kitchen of the maisonette, shall be glazed in frosted glass and be made inopenable, and they shall be permanently maintained and retained retained as such thereafter.\r\n\r\nReason: In order to prevent unreasonable overlooking of the neighbouring premises in accordance with the requirements of policies EN1 and EN19  of the London Borough of Camden Unitary Development Plan 2000.\r\n",
    "Condition : 6 - A 1.8 metre high screen, details of which shall have been submitted to and approved by the Council, shall be erected on all three sides of the proposed roof terrace prior to commencement of use of the roof as a terrace, and the screen shall be permanently retained and maintained as such thereafter.\r\n\r\nReason: In order to prevent unreasonable overlooking of neighbouring premises in accordance with the requirements of policies EN1 and EN19 of the London Borough of Camden Unitary Development Plan 2000.\r\n",
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed conversion would result in both residential units failing to meet the Council's minimum space standards as required by policy HG18 of the London Borough of Camden Unitary Development Plan 2000 and supporting advice in the Council's Supplementary Planning Guidance.\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposal, without any additional parking provision, would result in an excessive number of units for this property and is likely to increase the demand for parking spaces in a road, which is classified in the UDP as a Heavily Parked Street. It is, therefore, contrary to policy TR18 of the London Borough of Camden Unitary Development Plan 2000.\r\n"
