    "Condition : 4 - Notwithstanding the landscaping and fencing details for the rear garden shown on drawing 400D, no development shall take place until full details of appropriate hard and soft landscaping and means of enclosure of all un-built, open areas have been submitted to and approved by the Council. Such details shall include details of any proposed earthworks including grading, mounding and other changes in ground levels. \r\n\r\nReason: To enable the Council to ensure a reasonable standard of visual amenity in the scheme in accordance with the requirements of policies EN15 and EN35 of the London Borough of Camden Unitary Development Plan 2000.\r\n",
    "Condition : 5 - All hard and soft landscaping works shall be carried out to a reasonable standard in accordance with the approved landscape details by not later than the end of the planting season following completion of the development or any phase of the development, whichever is the sooner. Any trees or areas of planting which, within a period of 5 years from the completion of the development, die, are removed or become seriously damaged or diseased, shall be replaced as soon as is reasonably possible and, in any case, by not later than the end of the following planting season, with others of similar size and species, unless the Council gives written consent to any variation.\r\n\r\nReason: To ensure that the landscaping is carried out within a reasonable period and to maintain a satisfactory standard of visual amenity in the scheme in accordance with the requirements of policies EN15 and EN35 of the London Borough of Camden Unitary Development Plan 2000.\r\n",
