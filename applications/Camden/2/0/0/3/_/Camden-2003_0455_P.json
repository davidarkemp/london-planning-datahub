    "Condition : 2 - All new external work shall be carried out in materials that resemble, as closely as possible, in colour and texture those of the existing building, unless otherwise specified in the approved application.\r\n\r\nReason: To safeguard the appearance of the premises and the character of the immediate area in accordance with the requirements of policies EN1 and EN13 of the London Borough of Camden Unitary Development Plan 2000.\r\n",

Thereafter, the whole of the car parking provision shall be permanently retained and used for no purpose other than for the parking of vehicles of the occupiers and users of the development.\r\n\r\nReason: To ensure that the use of the premises does not add to parking pressures in surrounding streets which would be contrary to policies RE2 and TR17 of the London Borough of Camden Unitary Development Plan 2000.\r\n",
