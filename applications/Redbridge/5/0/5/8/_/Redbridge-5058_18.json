    "1) The development hereby permitted shall begin not later than three years from the date of this decision.\r\n2) The development hereby permitted shall be carried out in accordance with the following approved plans in so far as relevant to that part of the development hereby permitted: Site Plan Drawing Number 190 Rev A; Block Plan Drawing Number 195; Existing Plans Drawing Number El-00-DR-100 Rev C; Proposed Plans Drawing Number 101 Rev C; Roof Level Plan - Existing and Proposed Drawing Number 102 Rev C; Existing and Proposed Roof Drawing Number 105 Rev C; Existing Elevations Drawing Number 120 Rev C; Proposed Elevations Drawing Number 121 Rev C; Existing and Proposed Section Drawing Number 130; and 3D Axonometric Drawing Number 140 Rev B.\r\n\r\nConditions\r\n18. Overall, although I have found that the proposed dormers and roof lights would fail to preserve the character and appearance of the conservation area and the host property, the rear extension would be acceptable in this regard. Moreover, the proposed rear extension would not harm the living conditions of the adjacent occupiers. This element of the proposal is clearly severable from the alterations proposed to the roof, so I consider this element can be allowed on its own.\r\n19. For the reasons set out above, I conclude the appeal should be allowed in respect of the rear extension but dismissed in respect of the roof alterations.\r\n20. In addition to the standard implementation condition, I have imposed a condition specifying the relevant plans, as this provides certainty. In the interests of the character and appearance of the area a condition is required to control the external appearance of the extension.\r\n3) The materials to be used in the construction of the external surfaces of the development hereby permitted shall match those used in the existing building."
