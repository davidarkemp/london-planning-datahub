    "1.Your prior approval notification has been refused because the enlarged part would be part of a side extension to the original dwellinghouse and form a side / rear extension with a width greater than half the width of the original property contrary to Article 3, Schedule 2, Part 1, Class A of The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order, 2015 ( as amended)\r\n \r\n2. The Local Planning Authority considers that the impact of the proposed development on the amenity of adjoining residents would be unacceptable. The proposal by virtue of its depth, height and position on the shared boundary is considered to be excessive thereby incurring adverse impacts upon the amenities of neighbouring properties Noâ€™s 9 & 13, Georgeville Gardens, resulting in overshadowing, adverse outlook and an increased sense of enclosure. The adverse impacts are considered to be significant. Prior approval is required and the application is refused because of the above stated reason."
