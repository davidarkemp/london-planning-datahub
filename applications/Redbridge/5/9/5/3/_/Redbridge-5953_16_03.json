    "No noise assessment, nor mitigation, has been provided in terms of enhanced double glazing specifications  given potentially noisy uses adjacent to the scheme of the car wash to the west, the garage to the south and the busy road to the front. This mitigation would be needed to limit the potential for complaints against these lawful business uses and occupants of the homes and the lack of detail would be in conflict with policy LP24 (j) of the Local Plan."
