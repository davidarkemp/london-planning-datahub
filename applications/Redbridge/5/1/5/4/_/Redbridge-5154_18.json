    "1) Planning permission is approved for the additional mansard window only, as detailed on approved Location / Block Plan (Drawing Number A00 REV A) and approved plans: Drawing Numbers A02 REV A; A04 REV A; A07 REV A; and A09 REV A.\r\nConditions\r\n17. Should the appeal be allowed the Council, in accordance with good practice, has recommended conditions it would seek to be imposed. These include: a condition detailing the approved plans for the avoidance of doubt and in the interests of certainty; and a condition that seeks to ensure the external surfaces of the development match that of the existing building in the interests of the character and appearance of the area.\r\n18. As the development has commenced, an implementation condition is not necessary. A condition specifying the approved plans would meet the 6 tests related to the imposition of planning conditions3 and therefore should be imposed. However, I have worded this condition to be explicit in the fact that the planning permission is conveyed for the additional mansard window only, as set out in the description of development given on the original planning application form.\r\n19. In terms of a condition requiring external surfaces of the development to match those of the existing building, the appeal is retrospective as the additional mansard window is in place. As such, the Councilâ€™s suggested condition related to external surfaces of the development is not necessary as the mansard roof has already been built and it is acceptable in terms of its use of materials and appearance. Therefore, a condition requiring external surfaces of the development to match those of the existing building is not necessary and fails to meet at least one of the 6 tests mentioned above."
