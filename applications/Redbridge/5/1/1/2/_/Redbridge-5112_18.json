Further, the proposal, as shown on the proposed plans, would encroach on both party walls with the adjoining neighbours that flank the site, and would thus appear outside of the curtilage of the dwelling house. Therefore, the proposal does not comply with Article 3, Schedule 2, Part 1, Class A of The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 2015 (as amended)."
