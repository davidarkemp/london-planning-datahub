    "The appeal is allowed and approval is granted under the provisions of Article 3(1), Schedule 2, Part 1, Paragraph A.4 of The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended) (GPDO) for a single storey rear extension with a depth of 5.5 metres, highest point of 3.0 metres and height at the eaves of 2.75 metres at 43 Capel Gardens, Ilford IG3 9DF in accordance with the terms of the application Ref: 2953/18, dated 18 July 2018, and the plans submitted with it.\r\n\r\nFor the reasons given above, I conclude that the appeal should be allowed and approval granted. In granting approval the Appellant should note that the GPDO requires at Paragraphs A4 (13), (14) and (15) that the development shall be completed on or before 30th May 2019 and that the developer shall notify the local planning authority in writing of the completion of the development as soon as reasonably practicable after completion. Such notification shall include the name of the developer, the address or location of the development, and the date of completion"
