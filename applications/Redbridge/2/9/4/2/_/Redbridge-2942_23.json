    "The works to lift the crown to 8.5m above ground level are outside of industry guidance and would result in the loss of most of the viable crown area of this tree, as well as diminishing its contributions to the visual amenity of the locality. There are no universal rights to light regarding trees and the tree already has a higher-than-normal distance between the crown and ground level. As the works would be seriously detrimental to the trees health and longevity, as well as itâ€™s contributions provided to the visual amenity of the local area, the works requested are refused consent."
