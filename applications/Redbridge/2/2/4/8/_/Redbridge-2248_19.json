    "The proposal would result in the loss of a satisfactory dwelling unit, of a type and in a location which the Council considers to be suitable for continued residential use in order to help meet the demand for such accommodation.  As such, the proposal would result in the loss of a dwelling of a size and type which contributes to the housing stock as identified in the Boroughs SHMA (2016) and would have an adverse effect on the character of the area generally.  In addition, the proposed large HMO use would lead to intensification of the site with a significantly higher number of occupiers, resulting in a detrimental impact to the amenity of surrounding residents from increased noise and disturbance from general activity associated with the use.  Thus, the proposal is contrary to the Policies LP2, LP6 and LP26 of the Local Plan 2015-2030."
