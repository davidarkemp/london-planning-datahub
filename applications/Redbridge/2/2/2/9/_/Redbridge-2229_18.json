    "Land Contamination\r\nThe following shall be only carried out by suitably qualified persons in accordance with ‘CLR 11: Model procedures for the Management of Land Contamination’ and British Standard 10175:2011+A2:2017 ‘Investigation of Potentially Contaminated Sites – Code of Practice’:\r\n\r\n1.\tBefore the development hereby permitted commences at the site:\r\na)\tA desk-top study, site reconnaissance, as well a site investigation and assessment methodology shall be undertaken to further characterise risks to receptors at the site. The findings shall be included in a Report and submitted to the Local Planning Authority (LPA) for approval prior to any site investigations being undertaken.\r\n\r\nb)\tA Site Investigation Report detailing the findings of the investigations shall be produced and submitted to the LPA for approval prior to any remediation works being undertaken at the site.\r\n\r\nc)\tA detailed Remediation Strategy, where this has been identified as necessary from the findings of the site investigation, shall be submitted to the LPA for approval prior to any remediation options, implementation timetable, works schedule, site management objectives, monitoring proposals and a remediation validation methodology. The scheme once completed must ensure that the site will not qualify as ’Contaminated Land’ under Part 2A of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 in relation to its intended use.\r\n\r\n2.\tAfter development commences and prior to occupation\r\na)\tA verification Report confirming completion and adequacy of the remediation scheme shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the LPA before any part of the development is first occupied.\r\n\r\nb)\tIf during the course of development any contamination is discovered that was not previously identified, then this shall be reported to the LPA together with revised remediation proposals. If no contamination is found, then this shall be detailed in the remediation Verification Report.\r\n\r\nReason: To ensure that the development can be carried out safely without unacceptable risks to workers, other receptors and that risks to future users of the site are minimised."
