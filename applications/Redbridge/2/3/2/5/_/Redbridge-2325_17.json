    "The submitted plans are inaccurate and fail to show the true relationship of the site with the adjoining neighbour, No.44A Seymour Gardens. Notwithstanding the inaccurate plans, the proposed rear extension, by reason of its cumulative depth when taken together with the existing single storey rear extension and its position close to the boundaries of the site, would be an intrusive and unneighbourly addition, out of scale with the host building and out of character with this and surrounding dwellings, and would be visually intrusive to occupants of neighbouring properties, resulting in a loss of outlook, loss of light and increased sense of enclosure and would be overbearing on the adjoining occupiers at ground floor flat, no. 44A Seymour Gardens. Thus the proposal is contrary to Policy LP26 of the Council's Local Plan."
