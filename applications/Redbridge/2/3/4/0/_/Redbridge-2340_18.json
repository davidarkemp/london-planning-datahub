The conditions set out in the accompanying schedule are based on those suggested by the Council. These conditions have been considered against the tests of the Framework and advice provided by the Planning Practice Guidance (PPG) on conditions. Those included in the schedule are found to be reasonable and necessary in the circumstances of this case.\r\n13. In addition to the standard condition regarding the time period for implementation, there is a need for a condition specifying the plans to which the permission relates, in the interests of certainty and clarity. Similarly, condition 3 refers to the requirement for materials to match the existing which is in the interests of protecting the character and appearance of the CA."
