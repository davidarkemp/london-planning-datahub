    "Your prior approval notification has been refused because the enlarged part would be attached to its 1st floor rear bay projection forming a side / rear extension with a width greater than half the width of the original dwellinghouse, therefore it does not comply with Article 3, Schedule 2, Part 1, Class A of The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 2015 (as amended) In addition, the dwelling has angled boundaries and it is difficult for the LPA to assess whether the extension would encroach on its boundary with  102, The Drive, Cranbrook. Therefore, detailed drawings in terms of existing & proposed layouts / elevations & location plans are needed."
