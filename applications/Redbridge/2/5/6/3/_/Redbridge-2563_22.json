    "The tree was not found to be suppressed by the adjacent horse chestnut tree and would not be classified as having an abnormal growth habit. The issue relating to sticky residue is considered a seasonal issue and would not be sufficient to request works to a TPO tree. With regards to shading, there are no universal rights to light in the UK and this is insufficient justification to warrant works to a TPO tree. The photos provided by the applicant show the movement of some slabs within the rear extent of the garden that are placed immediately adjacent to the base of the main stem. Movement of slabs in this location would be expected due to the movement and seasonal growth of tree roots as insufficient space has been provided or considered to permit the trees future growth. It is currently unknown if soil was excavated or compacted for the installation of the patio slabs, which would be to the detriment of this protected tree, as this can cause an anaerobic soil rooting environment. Furthermore, the placement of a hard standing in this location would alter the treeâ€™s ability to obtain water from the soil rooting environment. There are engineered solutions to first be explored to reduce the movement of patio slabs in this location, such as the removal of the two slabs with the most movement. At such proximity to the stem of the tree, future movement should have been expected and the removal of slab would be a less extreme course of action to follow.\r\n\r\nThe National House Building Councils current technical guidance is that Lime trees have a moderate demand for water and a zone of influence of up to 22m. Whilst the tree is within or close to this zone of influence, no damage to any property has been alleged and the Local Planning Authority would not consider felling this tree without the relevant documents from a Subsidence investigation, namely a site engineers report, soil analysis, anatomical analysis, level monitoring readings, drainage investigation and an arboricultural report, that would confirm the trees involvement as causing localised foundation movement through the extraction of soil moisture. To assess the removal of this tree based on possible future damage would not be appropriate. For the reasons outlined, consent is refused to fell T4 Lime."
