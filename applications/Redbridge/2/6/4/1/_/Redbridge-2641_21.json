    "Your prior approval notification has been refused because the submitted plans are inconsistent in terms of the location of the existing swimming pool & out-building to establish 50% amenity space  requirement of the curtilage of the subject site,  without which neither the Council nor the adjoining occupiers are able to satisfactorily assess the impact of this proposal.  The proposal is against the criteria of Article 3, Schedule 2, Part 1, Class A of The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 2015 (as amended) and also would be difficult to determine whether or not the proposal is permitted development. The applicant has been advised to give clarity ( site plan, showing the details of the swimming pool & the out-building which is not shown on the submitted plans) to demonstrate that the above details are sufficiently submitted to determine this proposal."
