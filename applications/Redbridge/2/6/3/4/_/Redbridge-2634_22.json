  "decision_date": "23/09/2022",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "Consent is refused for the following works: T1 and T2 Cypress. The trees are on the rear boundary of the applicant’s property and are visible from the public realm along Northumberland Avenue and Aran Drive, providing a good collective contribution to the visual amenity of the local area. The applicant is requesting consent to fell both trees to ground level and grind stump as they pose a risk of damage to property. They are an estimated 16m from the applicant’s property and the current technical advice from the National House Building Council is that the Monterey Cypress trees have a zone of influence of up to 20m, placing the trees within this influence zone. However, no damage has been stated to the property at present and the applicant has not provided any information to suggest that the property is at an increased risk of damage. Without sufficient information to indicate that the property is at risk of damage or that a lesser course of action to reduce the risk of damage has been attempted, this application to fell T1 and T2 is refused consent."
