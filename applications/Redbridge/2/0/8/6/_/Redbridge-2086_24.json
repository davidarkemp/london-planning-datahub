    "As the tree is a historic pollard it would be appropriate to uphold the maintenance of this tree, by re-pollarding back to the original pruning points, or establishing new pruning points at some 1m above the historic ones. This would remove the poles exhibiting localised branch tip dieback and upholding the trees management regime. The epicormic growth throughout the trees structure denotes that it has a good capability to respond to pruning works and to re-establish a leaf area. The proposal is therefore,\r\nrefused for the works to T9 (Horse Chestnut - dead)  to  fell it to ground level."
