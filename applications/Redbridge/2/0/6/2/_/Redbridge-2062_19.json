    "The proposal involves the loss of a single family dwelling house of a size and in a location which the Council considers to be inappropriate for sub-division into more than one dwelling and so would have an adverse effect on the character of the area generally, and on the amenities enjoyed by occupants of the neighbouring property in particular, by reason of increased activity, noise and general disturbance. Thus, it is contrary to Policy SP3 of the Core Strategy Development Plan Document and Policy H2 of the Borough Wide Primary Policies Development Plan Document."
