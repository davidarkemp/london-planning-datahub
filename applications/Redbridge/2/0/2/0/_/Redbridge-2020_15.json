    "The proposal, because of its position, height, design and appearance would result in a dominant and visually intrusive feature, out of scale and character with development in the surrounding area and would therefore be detrimental to the visual amenity of the locality, failing to sustain and enhance the character and appearance of the Conservation Area. Thus, it is contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework and Policy SP3 of the Core Strategy Development Plan Document and Policies BD1, E3 and E6 of the Borough Wide Primary Policies Development Plan Document."
