    "No further information has been provided regarding the extent of decay at the base, whether there is internal decay and how far this extends up the main stem. Additionally, the tree has been the subject of previous crown reduction management works and it has not been communicated through this application why it is not possible to reduce the crown back to previous pruning points, or why this work would be insufficient given the extent of decay present. The exposed wood is heartwood which is physiologically dead within a tree and there is a pile of ‘frass’ present, which indicates the presence of insect activity. However, this has not been commented on by the applicant and is not significant in relation to the wound present. Given the information provided, it is not apparent why a lesser course of action, such as undertaking a whole crown reduction back to previous pruning points, is not sufficient for this tree and why the most extreme course of action as felling is being requested. It is for these reasons that the works requested within this application are refused consent.\r\n\r\nit is recommended that the applicant submit a further application seeking the continuation of the crown management works. Additionally, it is recommended that the tree is inspected by a competent and qualified specialist for the wound at the base, to inform the future management of this tree."
