    "The surrounding area is entirely commerical and the site is not currently considered an appropriate location for residential housing.  The site is small and its conversion to a residential use would be a piecemeal redevelopment, potentially fettering more comprehensive redevelopment of the area. Moreover, the location of windows and balconies on the boundary also having the potential to fetter the future development potential of adjacent sites. Furthermore, there is no information submitted with the application to demonstrate that future residential occupation of the proposed building would not fetter the efficient business operation of the nearby mechanical workshop. Accordingly, the proposal is not considered to be in the interests of the proper planning of the area, contrary to Policies SP1 and SP3 of the Core Strategy and BD1 of the Borough Wide Primary Policies DPD."
