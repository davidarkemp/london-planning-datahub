    "1) The development hereby permitted shall begin not later than 3 years from the date of this decision.\r\n2) The development hereby permitted shall be carried out in accordance with the following approved plans: Location Plan; Block Plan; Drawing Number JS/JP/1305/01; and Drawing Number JS/SP/1305/02.\r\nConditions\r\n14. In order to provide certainty regarding what has been granted planning\r\npermission, I have attached a condition specifying the approved drawings. The\r\nCouncil has suggested that a condition is required in respect of matching\r\nmaterials. The proposed works are within the highway boundary and such\r\nworks would either have to be carried out by the Highway Authority on behalf\r\nof the appellant or be undertaken to the specification required by the Highway\r\nAuthority. Consequently, I do not consider that this condition is necessary."
