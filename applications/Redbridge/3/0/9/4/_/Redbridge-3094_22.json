    "Unless the Council consider it unjustified, it is a statutory requirement to replace trees in Conservation Areas that are removed because they are dead and/or dangerous. In this instance, the Council will require the tree[s] notified for removal to be replaced. The position of the tree[s] need not be identical to that of those removed but should be in the rear garden. The planting shall be undertaken in the first planting season [November to March] or part\r\nthereof following the commencement of works on site as agreed under the work to trees application. The Local Planning Authority shall also be informed in writing once the replacement trees have been planted. Failure to comply with this statutory requirement may result in the issue of a 'Tree Replacement Notice' under section 207 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe planting shall be undertaken in the first planting season [November to March] or part thereof following the commencement of works on site as agreed under the work to trees application.
