    "The plans submitted with your application do not appear to accurately reflect the existing situation on site with regards to the position of the existing side structure along the boundary of 102, Tudor Road. This is also contradictory to the details shown on the site plan & block plan. This has been verified with the Councilâ€™s internal GIS / Apas records.  Your prior approval notification has been refused because the enlarged part would be linked to the side structure / out-building attached to the proposed extension forming an extension with a width greater than half the width of the original dwellinghouse & its  depth greater than 6 metres and  therefore, does  not comply with Article 3, Schedule 2, Part 1, Class A.1  of The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 2015 (as amended)"
