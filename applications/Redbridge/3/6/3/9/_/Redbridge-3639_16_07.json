  "description": "Hard surfacing (Condition 12): Variation of (Condition 2) of approved planning permission 1279/13: building heights of block 1, 2, and 3 increased to accommodate LHDG ceiling heights and structural slab thicknesses. Some of the metal work (Juliette balconies) has been removed to reduce cost and improve buildability of scheme. External material to the ground and 1st floor has been changed from Marley Equitone Cladding to brickwork to improve robustness of materials at street level. The staircase behind the retail unit has been removed to remove access onto third party land. Access into the car park behind block 3 has been amended to avoid the creation of a transfer structure under block 3 and create more sensible access directly from access road. The access road from Ilford Hill has been replaced slightly in order to utilise the existing crossover on site. The car park and landscape has been amended to accommodate the road alignment. The entrance to block 3 has been amended to allow access directly from the main access road (Summary).",
