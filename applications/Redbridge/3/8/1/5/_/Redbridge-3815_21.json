    "An alternative course of works was reccomended by the Arborist which would be more appropriate to restore the tree to a safe nad healthy condition without requiring the full removal of a protected tree.\r\n\r\nThe alternative works are set out below:\r\n•\tRemove deadwood exceeding 5cm in diameter and 1m in length. However, this work is exempt from prior consent from the local planning authority as this is in the interest of health and safety for visitors to the property. \r\n•\tRemoval of dead limb with Inonotus hispidus on south at 8m above ground level, by pruning back to union and branch collar. This limb is dead and currently extends over the boundary line of 45 into the neighbouring garden and requires removal. \r\n•\t3m whole crown reduction. This would reduce the size of the crown of the tree and would increase the amount of light into the rear garden of the property. Once started, this work would be required on a cyclical basis to maintain the size of the crown and the tree in a healthy and safe condition"
