The protection measures shall be implemented prior to any below ground works, and shall be retained for the entire period of the duration of any work at the site, in connection with the development hereby permitted. In addition, any roots found whilst carrying out construction works shall be dealt with in accordance with BS 5837:2012 and NJUG Volume 4 (2007). For the pouring of wet concrete for foundations, an impermeable liner is to be installed in accordance with 7.4.4.5 of BS5837:2012, to stop the spread of toxic concrete leachate into the soil rooting environment of the retained tree. \r\n\r\nReason: In order to maintain the existing vegetation at the site, which makes an important contribution to the character of the area, and to accord with Policies LP26 and LP38 of the Councilâ€™s Local Plan."
