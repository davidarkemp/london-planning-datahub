The Council has not supplied a list of draft conditions in respect of these proposals. However, given the nature of the proposed development and having regard to the Planning Policy Guidance and the Framework I have decided to attach conditions regarding materials to protect the character and appearance of the area and in the interests of certainty I have attached a condition specifying the approved plans. Furthermore, I have included a condition requiring obscure glazing in the flank windows facing on to No.137 Whitehall Road and the flank window in the rear conservatory facing No 133 Whitehall Road to prevent overlooking."
