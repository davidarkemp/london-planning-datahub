    "The consent for work to TPO 62/09 is refused. It is recommended to resubmit the application with works for a 3m crown reduction in height and crown spread.\r\n\r\nThe tree is a Sycamore approximately 12m in height. At the time of the inspection the tree is in good condition with good crown vitality. Works which have been requested are unsuitable and not in line with industry best practice. The lineal measures should be exact as in not doing so can cause an unbalanced future crown would result in impacting the trees future structural integrity."
