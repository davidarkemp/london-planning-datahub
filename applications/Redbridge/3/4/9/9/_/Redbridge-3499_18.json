The development hereby permitted shall be carried out in accordance with the following approved plans: 1:1250 Location Plan, Livarch /19PD/101 Issue A, Livarch /19PD/201 Issue A, Livarch /19PD/301 Issue A, Livarch /19PD/401 Issue A, Livarch /19PD/501 Issue A, Livarch /19PD/601 Issue A, Livarch /19PD/701 Issue A and Livarch /19PD/801 Issue A.\r\n3. The materials to be used in the construction of the external surfaces, hereby permitted, shall match those used in the existing building.\r\nConditions\r\n7. For the reasons set out above, and having regard to all other matters raised, I conclude that the appeal should succeed.\r\n8. Other than the standard time condition, the Council has suggested a condition requiring the external materials to be used in the construction of the extension to match those of the existing building, in the interests of the character and appearance of the area, this is an appropriate condition. In addition, for the avoidance of doubt, a condition requiring that the development is carried out with the approved plans is also imposed."
