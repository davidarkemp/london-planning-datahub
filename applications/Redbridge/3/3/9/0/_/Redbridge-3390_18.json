    "1. The appeal is dismissed insofar as it relates to a first floor rear extension and loft conversion with a hip to gable wall alteration. The appeal is allowed insofar as it relates to the conversion of a store/garage into a habitable room and alterations to the roof of the front porch and planning permission is granted for the conversion of a store/garage into a habitable room and alterations to the roof of the front porch at 37 Byron Avenue, South Woodford, London E18 2HH in accordance with the terms of the application, Ref 3390/18, dated 15 August 2018 and the plans submitted with it so far as relevant to that part of the development hereby permitted and subject to the following conditions:\r\n1) The development hereby permitted shall begin not later than 3 years from the date of this decision.\r\n2) The development of the conversion of store/garage into a habitable room and alterations to roof of front porch hereby permitted shall be carried out in accordance with the following approved plans: Site Plan; 37BA (01) Rev A; 37BA (02) Rev A; 37BA (05) Rev C and 37BA (06) Rev C.\r\n3) The materials to be used in the construction of the external surfaces of the conversion of store/garage into a habitable room and alterations to roof of front porch hereby permitted shall match those used in the existing building.\r\nConditions\r\n12. Consideration has been given to the conditions suggested by the Council, so far as they relate to the proposed conversion of store/garage into a habitable room and alterations to the roof of the front porch, which have been assessed against the tests in the National Planning Policy Framework and Planning Practice Guidance. A condition specifying the relevant drawings is necessary as this provides certainty. In order to assist the assimilation of the garage conversion and porch alterations into the streetscene a condition is necessary for the external materials to match those of the host property."
