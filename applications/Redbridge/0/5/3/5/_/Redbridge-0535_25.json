    "I write with reference to your planning application for the above works submitted on 27th February 2025 being validated on 6th March 2025. This was submitted after the appeal against the enforcement notice was dismissed on all grounds on the 29th February 2020. \r\n\r\nThis was in relation to the unauthorised erection of a single storey front extension. The enforcement notice requires the removal of the structue its entirety, under reference APP/W5780/C/19/3232015, being under Council reference E0554/18 \r\n\r\nUnder Section 70C of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended) there is a power for the local planning authority to decline to determine a planning application where;\r\n\r\n…if granting planning permission for the development would involve granting, whether in relation to the whole or any part of the land to which a pre-existing enforcement notice relates, planning permission in respect of the whole or any part of the matters specified in the enforcement notice as constituting a breach of planning control.\r\n\r\nConsequently as the proposal is for works, including the unauthorised works to which the enforcement notice relates, this application has been declined to be determined and will be withdrawn from the register.\r\n\r\nGiven the complex history of this site, you would be seriously advised to gain detailed pre-application advice to understand what would be the appropriate way forward to resolve the planning issues. Please see https://www.redbridge.gov.uk/planning-and-building/planning/ which has links to either the pre application advice for homes or for commercial uses."
