    "Consent is refused for the following works: T1 (Oak) - reduce lateral stems by up to 3m, reduce height by up to 4m and crown lift to 6m.\r\n\r\nThe works to reduce the crown in height and spread are counterproductive to the reason of excessive shading stated. The tree is likely to respond with thicker and denser branch tip regrowth which would increase the blocking of light levels. Additionally, there are no universal rights to light regarding trees and this is an insufficient justification in undertaking works to this tree. The works would be detrimental to the trees health and longevity and would diminish its contributions to the visual amenity of the local area. On this basis the works requested are refused consent."
