    "The comments made in relation to a discharge of the main stem that suggests possible internal decay/bacterial infection are unfounded and no evidence has been provided to support these potential claims. It would be expected to support claims of internal decay with a Level 3 Investigation and sonic tomogram and/or resistograph investigation. Similar to this, the statement in relation to damage to the root plate has no basis or merit as no information has been provided regarding the condition of the trees structural condition in relation to this point has been provided. The issue stating proximity to the house also has no sound basis, as no information relating to the foundation type and depth, sub soil analysis has been provided to confirm that the relationship between the tree and property is unsuitable. The issue of debris in the gutters is a seasonal nuisance and not sufficient in supporting the works requested. The works requested would impact upon the visual amenity of the locality and would commence a cycle of routine maintenance that would be required to be upheld, on the basis of sound arboricultural practice. Given the impact to visual amenity and the lack of evidence to support the justifications/claims made, the works within this application are refused consent."
