    "The Local Planning Authority considers that the impact of the proposed development on the amenity of adjoining residents would be unacceptable. The proposal by its depth, height and position on the shared boundary is considered to be excessive thereby incurring adverse impacts upon the amenities of neighbouring property Noâ€™s.61& 65, Brancaster Road, resulting in overshadowing, adverse outlook and an increased sense of enclosure. The adverse impacts are significant. Prior approval is required and the application is refused because of the above stated reason."
