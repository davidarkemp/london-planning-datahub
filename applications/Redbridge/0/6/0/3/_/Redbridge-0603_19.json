    "The Local Planning Authority considers that the impact of the proposed development on the amenity of adjoining residents would be unacceptable. The proposal by virtue of its depth, style and position on the shared boundary is considered to be excessive thereby incurring adverse impacts upon the amenities of neighbouring property at No.4 Guildford Road, resulting in loss of light, adverse outlook, an increased sense of enclosure and loss of privacy due to the proposed side windows. The adverse impacts are considered to be significant. Prior approval is required and the application is refused because of the above stated reason."
