    "Given the descriptions and justifications provided there is currently insufficient evidence to justify the felling of these two trees, which would be detrimental to the visual amenity of the local area. It is for these reasons that the request to fell both T1 and T2 Lime is refused. It is recommended that the trees are inspected by a suitably qualified professional and that should a further application be submitted requesting to fell, this is accompanied by a tree condition report, clearly outlining the defects observed and that the request to fell is commensurate to any observable defects identified."
