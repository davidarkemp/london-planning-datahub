The removal of this tree would be seriously detrimental to the visual amenity of the locality and as there is insufficient justification in undertaking this, the works requested to fell T1 London Plane are refused consent. It is recommended that the agent/applicant or individual responsible for the management of this tree procure the services of a suitably qualified specialist to undertake a Level 3 advanced investigation of the tree, in particular the cavity at its base. Techniques using sonic tomography and resistograph readings are generally less invasive than others and are recommended."
