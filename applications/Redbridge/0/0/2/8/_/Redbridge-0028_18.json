    "The proposed rear extension, by reason of its scale, cumulative depth, position forward of the established building line to Windsor Road and proximity to the boundaries of the site, would be an intrusive and unneighbourly addition, out of scale and character with this and surrounding properties, as well as having a serious and adverse effect on the amenities enjoyed by occupants of the neighbouring property at No. 185 Ilford Lane, causing a significant loss outlook and an increased sense of enclosure. Thus, it is contrary to Policy SP3 of the Core Strategy Development Plan Document and Policies BD1 & BD5 of the Borough Wide Primary Policies Development Plan Document along with Policies LP26 and LP30 contained in the emerging Local Plan."
