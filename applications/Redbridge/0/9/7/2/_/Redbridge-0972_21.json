    "Your prior approval notification has been refused because the enlarged part would be built off the first floor rear projection which would form an extension with a width greater than half the width of the original dwellinghouse and therefore it does not comply with Article 3, Schedule 2, Part 1, Class A of The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 2015 (as amended). In addition, the existing & proposed plans in relation to its elevations are contradictory and a clarity to  the 1st floor original bay is required before the Council can determine whether the proposal falls within the parameters of the above GPDO, regulation 2015 (as amended)"
