    "The consent for work to TPO 37/14 is refused:\r\n\r\n-T4 (Lime) - remove to ground level, grind out stump and replace.\r\n\r\nIt is recommended that a staged pollard could be undertaken to reduce the regrowth and maintain the crown at a smaller size. This would reduce wind loading, correct the asymmetrical crown growth, and reduce end weight onto the small cavities identified. This work would maintain a mature tree in the urban setting and would continue to maintain its contributions to the visual amenity of the locality. The loss of this tree on the points set out would seriously be detrimental to the visual amenity of the locality and it is believed that an amended pollard cycle would be effective in managing this tree going forward."
