    "The proposed works to T1 sycamore are refused as the works are outside of industry best practice and would constitute topping, resulting in an unbalance the crown of the tree and affecting the future structural integrity.\r\n\r\nIt is recommended that a further application is submitted requesting a full crown reduction by 2-3m. A canopy thin should not be included as this would happen naturally due to the nature of reducing the crown of a tree. It is advisable that the removal of deadwood is exempt from prior written consent from the local planning authority."
