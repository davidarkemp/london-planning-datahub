There is no evidence to suggest that the root plate has shifted, and the structural integrity of the tree is lessened, and the applicant has provided no evidence to support this. The report has continued to state that the stability of the tree is compromised, however no evidence highlighting a lack of structural integrity, ill heath or defects of this tree have been provided. Without evidence to support this claim, this application has been refused consent."
