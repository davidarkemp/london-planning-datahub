    "Consent is refused for the following works: G1 (Ash) - reduce height by approximately 4.5m.\r\n\r\nThe works requested extend beyond the residents Common Law Right, whereby they have the right to prune back overhanging vegetation to the boundary line. The works to reduce the height of these trees is not included within this right. There are no sound justifications in reducing the height of G1 Ash, as this would create large areas of pruning wounds and would set forth a precedent that the crown reduction would be required on a cyclical basis. As the applicant is not the owner of these trees, the decision to commence this cycle would be inappropriate and as previously stated, extend beyond the Common Law Right to prune back overhanging vegetation."
