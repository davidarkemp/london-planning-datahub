    "1) The development hereby permitted shall be begun no later than the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.\r\n2) The development hereby permitted shall be carried out in accordance with the following approved plans: site location plan; ZAAVIA/58IL/201 A; ZAAVIA/58IL/202 A; ZAAVIA/58IL/203 A; ZAAVIA/58IL/205 A; and ZAAVIA/58IL/206 A.\r\n3) The premises shall only be open for customers between the following hours:\r\n1100 – Midnight Mondays - Fridays\r\n1100 – Midnight Saturdays and Sundays\r\n1100 – Midnight Bank Holidays.\r\n\r\n18. I have had regard to the list of suggested conditions provided by the LPA and have considered these in the context of the Framework which advises that conditions should only be imposed where they are necessary, relevant to planning and to the development to be permitted, enforceable, precise and reasonable in all other respects. I have also considered the suggested conditions in the context of the provisions of the Regulations, outlined above.\r\n\r\n19. For the reasons I have set out in the Procedural Matters, above, time limit and plans conditions are necessary in order to provide certainty. I have not included within the list of specified plans the plan indicating nearby parking1 spaces as I take its content to be indicative of those spaces, rather than space over which the appellant has direct control.\r\n\r\n20. To ensure that the development would be sensitive to the living conditions of occupiers of nearby residential properties, a condition setting out the hours of operation is both necessary and reasonable. I have revised the wording and format of the hours condition but the timings set out therein do not differ from those sought by the appellant or suggested by the Council. I have not, however, imposed the Council’s suggested condition limiting use of the appeal property to a use falling within Use Class A3 for reasons set out above in respect of the Regulations."
