    "The plans submitted (GA 802) with your application do not appear to accurately reflect the existing & proposed situation with regards to the position of the 1st floor original bay which is contradictory. Your prior approval notification has been refused because the enlarged part would be built off the first floor rear projection which would form an extension with a width greater than half the width of the original dwellinghouse and therefore it does not comply with Article 3, Schedule 2, Part 1, Class   A1 (h) (iii) of The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 2015 (as amended)"
