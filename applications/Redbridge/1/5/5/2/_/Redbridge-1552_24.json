    "The consent for work to  TPO 03/10 - T1 (Pine) - fell,  is refused. It is recommended to resubmit the application with works for a 3m crown reduction in height and crown spread.\r\n\r\nThe issue relating to roots is not supported by factual investigations or observations, rather the statement that roots are at the adjacent properties. No documents have been provided to confirm that the surrounding properties are impacted by damage and that this damage is caused by the roots of T1 Pine. Without this level of information it would not be applicable to permit the felling of this tree as the tree has not been implicated in any damage caused. The final issue relating to the obstruction of light is not an applicable justification. There are no universal rights to light with regards to trees and the Rights to Light Act 1959 sets out that only a pre-defined aperture of a building can be impacted by reduced light levels, not the garden of a property. The issue relating to pine needles is also not commensurate to the request to fell T1 Pine as this can be effectively mitigated and managed by the landowner(s) impacted. The loss of the tree on this basis would be in direct contravention to its protection through a Tree Preservation Order and the merits of this protection. The works requested are not commensurate to the issues stated and there are lesser courses of action available to the applicant to alleviate these issues. As such, the works requested are refused consent and it is recommended that a suitably qualified specialist is contacted to inspect the tree on the issues stated."
