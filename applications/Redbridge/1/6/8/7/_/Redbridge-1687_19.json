The proposal therefore, fails on this accord.\r\n172, Ashburton Ave supports the application but points out the above defect too.\r\nPrior approval not required / NOTPD\r\nYour prior approval notification has been refused because the submitted plans are inconsistent in terms of the proposed depth with the application form without which neither the Council nor the adjoining occupiers are able to satisfactorily assess the impact of these proposals.  The proposals are against the criteria of Article 3, Schedule 2, Part 1, Class A of The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 2015 (as amended)"
