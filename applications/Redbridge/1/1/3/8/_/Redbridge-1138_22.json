    "The description of works for this Notification includes replacement of the trees to be removed and this decision is mindful of and influenced by this. In this instance, the Council will require the trees to be replaced. The position of the trees need not be identical to that of those removed but should be in the rear garden. The following species are recommended: Corylus sp., Betula sp. Or Magnolia spp. The planting shall be undertaken in the first planting season [November to March] or part thereof following the commencement of works on site as agreed under the work to trees application. The Local Planning Authority shall also be informed in writing once the replacement trees have been planted. Failure to comply with this statutory requirement may result in the issue of a 'Tree Replacement Notice' under section 207 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990."
