    "Your prior approval notification has been refused because the enlarged part would form an extension with a width greater than half the width of the original dwellinghouse and its depth would be greater than 6 metres, therefore it does not comply with Article 3, Schedule 2, Part 1, Class A of The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 2015 (as amended). In addition, there is a contradiction in relation to the side gap between the proposed extension & its out-buildings as shown on its elevation plan 19/288 /005 & its block plan no. 19/288/001. The proposal, therefore,  is found to be contradictory and further clarifications are required."
