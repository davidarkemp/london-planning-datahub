The proposal by its depth, height and position on the shared boundaries is excessive thereby incurring adverse impacts upon the amenities of neighbouring properties Noâ€™s. 54 and 58 Glenham Drive, resulting in overshadowing, adverse outlook and an increased sense of enclosure. The adverse impacts are significant. Prior approval is required and the application is refused because of the above stated reason."
