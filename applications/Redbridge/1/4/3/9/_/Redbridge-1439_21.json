    "Trees are self-optimising structures that have adapted to maintain uniform stress over the entirety of their structure and as such are able to cope with extreme weather conditions if this arises. As well as this, yearly adaptive growth is put on annually in areas that are under severe strain to enable the trees long term health and longevity. At present, T1 is in a self-optimised state and requires no remedial works.\r\n\r\nIt is advisable that the removal of deadwood is exempt from prior consent from the local planning authority."
