  "decision_conditions": [
    "Prior Approval notification is refused because the proposed extension would extend beyond a wall forming a side elevation of the original dwellinghouse, and would have a width greater than half the width of the original dwellinghouse. In addition, the proposed development would adjoin an existing two-storey side/rear extension at the site which is located within 2 metres of a boundary and measures more than 3 metres in height at eaves level. Therefore, the development does not comply with Article 3, Schedule 2, Part 1, Class A of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 2015 (as amended)."
