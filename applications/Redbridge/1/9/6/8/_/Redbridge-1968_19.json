    "There are judged to be no sound arboricultural nor overbearing practical reasons to justify the works to the tree[s] in the manner proposed, the effects of which would seriously prejudice the health and appearance of the preserved tree[s] and visual amenity in general. Should a further application be received, the Council would, however, be minded to accept more sympathetic management of the trees in respect to their location, such as: re-pollarding of T25, and crown lifting/thinning/lateral reduction of T24 & T31 to maintain clearance from houses."
