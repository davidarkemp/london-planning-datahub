    "Consent is refused for the following works: T1 (Lime) - shorten laterals on house side by up to 3m (approximately 10m up tree).\r\n\r\nThe works to shorten the laterals on the house side by 3m and up to a height of 10m, would remove additional crown material on this axis than what is considered suitable. Whilst applications are assessed on their own merits, the recent application 1641/25 has sought consent for a 4m reduction. This has been granted and to consent to the 3m lateral reduction within this application would create a scenario whereby a total of 7m of crown material can be removed on the property side. This would remove the entire crown material on this axis and would not be considered appropriate. On this basis, this element of the application is refused consent."
