  "decision_conditions": [
    "Unless the Council consider it unjustified, it is a statutory requirement to replace trees in Conservation Areas that are removed because they are dead and/or dangerous. In this instance, the Council will require the trees notified for removal to be replaced. The position of the trees need not be identical to that of those removed. The planting shall be undertaken in the first planting season [November to March] or part thereof following the commencement of works\r\n\r\nFailure to comply with this statutory requirement may result in the issue of a 'Tree Replacement Notice' under section 207 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990."
