    "Your prior approval notification has been refused because the enlarged part would extend beyond the original width of the dwelling and would be attached to its first floor rear extension which was granted approval under reference no. PL/0916/77 on 11/08/1977, thereby forming a wraparound side / rear extension with a width greater than half the width of the original dwellinghouse, the eaves height of which would also exceed 3 metres within 2 metres  of the boundary and therefore, does not comply with Article 3, Schedule 2, Part 1, Class A of The Town and Country Planning ( GPDO ) Order , 2015 (as amended) In addition, the terrace adjoining the extension has a height greater than 30cm which affects the proposed roof heights  and therefore, side elevation & rear elevation of the proposed extension is required to establish that the proposal complies with the above Legislation."
