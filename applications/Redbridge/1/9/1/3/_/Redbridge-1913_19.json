    "Your prior approval notification has been refused because the proposed extension together with existing two storey rear extension would form an enlargement which would have more than a single storey and extend beyond the original rear wall of the house by more than 3 metres. In addition, it would form a two storey rear extension which would be located within 2 metres of the side boundary.  The proposal would therefore conflict with criterion (h)(i) and (i) of Article 3, Schedule 2, Part 1, Class A of The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 2015 (as amended)."
