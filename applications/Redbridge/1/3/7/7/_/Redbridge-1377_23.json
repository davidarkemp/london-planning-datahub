    "Whilst cracking has been identified at the juncture of the main property and the recent extension, no evidence or information has been provided to confirm that is caused by vegetation related removal of moisture from the ground around the property by G1 Lime. Without level monitoring it is not possible to comment if the movement at the property is indeed cyclical by nature, confirming the involvement of vegetation related moisture removal from the surrounding soil.   Additionally, without a soil analysis it is currently unknown if the soil is desiccated or capable of volumetric fluctuations consistent with subsidence related damage. Furthermore, given the extent of and proximity of trees in relation to the property, it is not possible to confirm the involvement of the three lime trees in G1 as factors of subsidence related damage at the property, this would be confirmed by the recovery and subsequent anatomical analysis of root samples during a site investigation and borehole excavation. As such, the evidence submitted so far does not confirm the involvement of these trees as causal factors of subsidence related damage at the property, the removal of which without sufficient confirmation would be detrimental to the visual amenity of the local area and set a precedent for tree removal in this location with insufficient information to confirm trees as a factor of damage."
