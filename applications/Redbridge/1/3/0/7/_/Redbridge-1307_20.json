    "Unless the Council consider it unjustified, it is a statutory requirement to replace trees in Conservation Areas that are removed because they are dead and/or dangerous. In this instance, the Council will require the trees notified for removal to be replaced.  \r\n\r\nThe position of the new trees need not be identical to those to be removed, but should be on the eastern boundary of the church grounds. The following species are recommended:\r\n\r\n- Taxus baccata (yew);\r\n- Taxus baccata fastigiata (fastigiate yew);\r\n- Ilex aquifolium (holly);\r\n- Fagus sylvatica (beech).\r\n\r\nThe planting shall be undertaken in the first planting season [November to March] or part thereof following the commencement of works on site as agreed under the work to trees application. The Local Planning Authority shall also be informed in writing once the replacement trees have been planted.\r\n\r\nFailure to comply with this statutory requirement may result in the issue of a 'Tree Replacement Notice' under section 207 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990."
