The proposal by its depth, height and position on the shared boundary is excessive thereby incurring adverse impacts upon the amenities of neighbouring property No. 2, Lyndhurst Gardens, resulting in overshadowing, adverse outlook and an increased sense of enclosure. The adverse impacts are significant. Prior approval is required and the application is refused because of the above stated reason."
