    "Your prior approval notification has been refused because the enlarged part would be built off the first floor rear extension which would result in the enlarged part of the house having more than one storey and the enlarged part of the house would be within 2 meters of the boundary of the curtilage of the dwellinghouse and the height of the eaves of the enlarge part will exceed 3 meters. This would result in an L-shaped side and rear extension greater than half the width of the house.The development therefore, does not comply with Article 3, Schedule 2, Part 1, Class A of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 2015 (as amended)"
