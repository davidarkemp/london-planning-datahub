    "Your prior approval notification has been refused because the enlarged part would be built off its first floor non-original rear extension which would result in the enlarged part of the house having more than one storey extension affecting its permitted development heights within 2 meters of the boundary of the curtilage of the dwellinghouse. The proposal thereby would form a side / rear extension with a width greater than half the width of the original dwellinghouse and therefore, does not comply with Article 3, Schedule 2, Part 1, Class A of The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 2015(as amended)"
