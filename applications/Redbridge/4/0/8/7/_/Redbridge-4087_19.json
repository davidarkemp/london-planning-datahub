    "1) The development hereby permitted shall be carried out in accordance with the following approved plan: WPCL0349/19/PL02.\r\nConditions\r\n16. The Council has put forward a total of three conditions to be imposed should I\r\nbe minded to allow the appeal, which I have considered against the tests of the\r\nFramework and advice provided by the Planning Practice Guidance. In that\r\nrespect, a plans compliance condition is required in the interest of certainty of\r\nthe permission granted. However, the time limit condition is not imposed as the\r\ndevelopment has already been commenced. Furthermore, it is also not\r\nnecessary to impose a condition requiring matching materials as a submitted\r\nplan (ref: WPCL0349/19/PL02) indicates the use of external materials to match\r\nthe appearance of the existing roof tiles which I observed to be acceptable\r\nduring my visit."
