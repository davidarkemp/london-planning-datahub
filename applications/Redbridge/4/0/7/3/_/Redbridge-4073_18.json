The findings shall be included in a Report and submitted to the Local Planning Authority (LPA) for approval prior to any investigations being undertaken. \r\n\r\nb)   A Report detailing the findings of the investigations shall be produced and submitted to the LPA for approval prior to any remediation works being undertaken at the site. \r\n\r\nc)   A detailed Remediation Strategy, where this has been identified as necessary from the findings of the site investigation and monitoring, shall be submitted to the LPA for approval prior to any remediation works being undertaken at the site to render it suitable for its proposed use.  This scheme shall include an appraisal of remediation options, implementation timetable, works schedule, site management objectives, monitoring proposals and a remediation validation methodology. The scheme once completed must ensure that the site will not qualify as 'Contaminated Land' under Part 2A of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 in relation to its intended use. \r\n\r\n\r\n2.\tPrior to use as a nursery:\r\n\r\na)\tA Verification Report confirming completion and adequacy of the remediation scheme shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the LPA before any part of the building is occupied.\r\n\r\nb)\tIf during the course of remediation any contamination is discovered that was not previously identified, then this shall be reported to the LPA together with revised remediation proposals. If no contamination is found, then this should be detailed in the remediation Verification Report.\r\n\r\nReason: To ensure that risks to future users of the site are minimised."
