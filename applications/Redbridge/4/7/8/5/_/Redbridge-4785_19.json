    "12. In addition to the standard condition regarding the commencement of development, a condition is imposed specifying the approved plans in the interest of clarity. A condition requires details of the proposed external materials to be submitted in order to ensure that the development complements the appearance of the existing building and surrounding development.\r\n13. Conditions require the submission of a scheme describing how future occupants of the development would be excluded from any local car parking permit scheme and details are required of cycle storage arrangements in the interests of sustainable travel. Details of refuse and recycling storage facilities are required in the interests of visual amenity. A construction management plan is sought in order to minimise impacts on the environment and amenity of neighbours.\r\n14. A condition requires details of surface water drainage in order to ensure there would be no increased risk of flooding, to improve water quality and enhance biodiversity. A comprehensive energy strategy is also needed in order to ensure energy and resource efficiency.\r\n15. The suggested conditions regarding compliance with the Building Regulations are inappropriate as these matters are the subject of separate legislation and control."
