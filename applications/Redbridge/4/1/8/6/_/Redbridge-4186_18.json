For the reasons given above I conclude that the appeal should be allowed in relation to the outbuilding. However, in relation to the single storey lean-to the appeal should be dismissed.\r\n14. In respect of the outbuilding, I have attached the standard time limit condition and a condition requiring that the development is carried out in accordance with the approved plans, in the interests of certainty. In the interests of the character and appearance of the area I have imposed a condition relating to external materials."
