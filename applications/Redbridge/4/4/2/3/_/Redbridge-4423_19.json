    "Your prior approval notification has been refused because the eaves height needs to be clearly stated on the application form & drawings. In addition, the yellow box shown on the aerial photograph does not clearly indicate the positioning in terms of depth (plan & elevation) of the proposed structure and appears to give the impression as the proposed extension would be extended beyond its original width. The Local Planning Authority and the adjacent neighbours therefore, cannot satisfactorily assess the impact of the proposal on neighbouring amenity. The proposal therefore, does not comply with Article 3, Schedule 2, Part 1, Class A of The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 2015 (as amended)"
