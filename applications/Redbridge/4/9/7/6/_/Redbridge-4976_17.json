    "The proposed development forecourt parking shall not be occupied until pedestrian visibility splays of 1.5m by 1.5m have been provided on each side of the vehicle access, with the depth measured from the back of the footway and the widths outwards from the edges of the access and thereafter permanently retained; no fence, wall or other obstruction to visibility exceeding 0.6m in height above the surface of the adjoining highway shall be erected within the area of such splays. The visibility splays shall thereafter be permanently maintained.\r\n\r\nReason: In order to ensure that the development has a satisfactory layout, design and relationship to its surroundings to allow functional vehicular, cycle and pedestrian movement, and to accord with Policies T5 and BD1 of the Council's Borough Wide Primary Policies Development Plan Document and Policy 6.13 of the London Plan."
