I have taken account of the conditions suggested by the Council. Due to the development being substantially completed at the time of my visit, a condition setting a time limit for commencement is no longer appropriate or relevant and I have therefore not imposed one. However, I have imposed conditions relating to compliance with the approved plans and the requirement for external surfaces to be constructed in materials which match those used on the existing building and prior approval extension. These are reasonable and necessary for reasons of character and appearance."
