Do the same for the southern, western and northern crown faces over the path but only to 2.5m in height (still 2m in length removal).\r\n\r\nT97 (birch): Prune back on eastern crown face to kerb line, to remove overhang over the parking area (lateral length removal of 1-1.5m).\r\n\r\nT99-100 (holly): Maintain a 3m clearance over the footpath and 5.2m over the road, by pruning back to suitable points, every year (removing lateral growth of between 0.5-1.5m in length, up to the specified heights).",
