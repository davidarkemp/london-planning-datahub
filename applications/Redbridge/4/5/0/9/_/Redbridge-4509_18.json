    "1. The appeal is the allowed and planning permission is granted for the erection of a first floor rear extension at 12 Raymond Road, Newbury Park, Ilford IG2 7EA in accordance with the terms of the application Ref 4509/18, dated 31 October 2018, subject to the following conditions:\r\n1. The development hereby permitted shall begin not later than three years from the date of this decision.\r\n2. The development hereby permitted shall be carried out in accordance with the following approved plans: N.A/12RR/001 Issue A, N.A/12RR/002 Issue A, N.A/12RR/003 Issue A, N.A/12RR/004 Issue A and N.A/12RR/005 Issue A.\r\n3. The materials to be used in the construction of the external surfaces hereby permitted shall match those used in the existing building.\r\nConditions\r\n7. For the reasons set out above, and having regard to all other matters raised, I conclude that the appeal should succeed.\r\n8. Other than the standard time condition, the Council has suggested a condition requiring the external materials to be used in the construction of the extension to match those of the existing building, in the interests of the character and appearance of the area, this is an appropriate condition. In addition, for the avoidance of doubt, a condition requiring that the development is carried out with the approved plans is also imposed."
