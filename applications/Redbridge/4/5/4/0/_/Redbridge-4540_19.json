    "The Council does not accept the stated reason for the works as sufficient justification for canopy reduction - particularly that proposed for T1. If undertaken in the manner proposed, this work would prejudice the appearance and amenity value of the preserved trees, and achieve little purpose other than to promote the production of dense regrowth. Notwithstanding this, should a further application be received, the Council may be minded to agree some minor trimming back of the lateral overhang of T1 to 22-49 Long Green and shaping / thinning of the regrowth of T2 to improve its form."
