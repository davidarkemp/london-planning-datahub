    "1. SITE: \rThe application relates to a two-storey property located on the south side of Woodvale Walk and currently in use as a single dwelling house. The application drawings show the property to be a four-bedroom house with all four bedrooms on the first floor.\r\rThe property is not within a Conservation Area nor is the building listed. The surrounding area is predominantly residential and is characterised by a mix of terraced dwellings and flats.\r\r\r2. HISTORY\r\rNo previous planning history exists on file.  \r \r\r3. DETAILS\r\rThe proposal involves the conversion of the single dwelling house into two self-contained flats comprising of 2 x two-bedroom units. The resultant development would include (if granted):\r\rFlat 1 (Ground Floor - 3 persons)\rLiving/Dining/Kitchen (16.7 sq.m)\rBedroom 1 (10.0 sq.m)\rBedroom 2  (5.7 sq.m)\r\rFlat 2 (First Floor - 3 persons)\rLiving/Dining (19.0 sq.m)\rKitchen (11.0 sq.m)\rBedroom 1 (6.0 sq.m)\r\rA refuse storage area would be provided to the front of the building adjacent to the main access.\r\rNo external alterations or extensions are proposed as part of the proposal.\r\rNo car parking is provided as part of the proposed development. In addition, no cycle parking is proposed although it is noted that the rear garden has an independent access and a purpose built cycle storage area could be constructed although nothing is shown on the submitted drawings.\r\r\r4. RELEVANT UNITARY DEVELOPMENT PLAN POLICIES \r\rAdopted UDP (1998)\rH1 - Housing provision\rH10 - Residential Development Standards (ST1  - Layout and Design, ST2 -Density, ST3 - Daylight and Sunlight, ST4 - Security and Safety, ST5  - Privacy, ST11 Layout, parking and servicing, ST13 - Refuse)\rH17 - Flat conversions\rT12 - Parking standards\rT17 - Transport implications of development proposals\rT36 - Cycle parking\rCD15 - Design of new development\rENV19 - Noise and Control\rENV24  - Waste management and disposal.\rENV25 - Recycling\r\rReplacement UDP (2006)\rPolicy 9 - Transport impact\rPolicy 14 - Parking and traffic restraint\rPolicy 15 - Additional housing\rPolicy 17 - Flat conversions\rPolicy 31a - Community safety/Designing out crime\rPolicy 42 - Conservation areas\rPolicy 50  - Waste\r\rThe current up to date statement of the Council's planning policies is contained in the Replacement Lambeth UDP.  This is now at an advanced stage in the process of adoption.  Further Proposed Modifications have been placed on deposit ending on 15th June 2007.  These, together with the unaltered parts of the Proposed Modifications (October 2006) and the unaltered parts of the Revised Deposit UDP, should be used for development control purposes. \rConsiderable weight can now therefore be attached to policies which were not subject to objection at the earlier October 2006 Proposed Modifications stage and those that were recommended by the Inspector.  \rIt is anticipated that the Replacement UDP will be adopted in July 2007\r\rOther (including SPG)\rThe following Council Supplementary Planning Guidance was also considered relevant\r-\tSPG4 - Internal layout and Room Sizes\r\rUDP Designation(s)\rThe site has no specific designation under Adopted or Replacement Lambeth Unitary Development Plans.\r\r\r5. CONSULTATION\rAddresses (26 in total):\rWoodvale Walk 1, 2, 3, 4, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 88, 89, 90, 91, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110, 111, 112-113, \r\rObjections: YES. One objection has been received on the grounds of loss of privacy and loss of sunlight/daylight.\r\rThe Council's Transport Planner has raised no objections to the planning application. \r\r\r6. ASSESSMENT\r\rCOMPLIANCE WITH CONVERSION POLICIES\r\rH17 of the Adopted UDP (1998)\r\r1.\tThe size of the property exceeds two storeys (converted roofspaces areas are discounted from this definition) and has more than 6 habitable rooms: NO\r\r2.\tAcceptable dwelling mix. NO. Policy H17 requires conversion schemes to contain a balanced dwelling mix comprising a mix of 2 and 3(+) bedroom units.\r\rTHE PROPOSAL IS COMPLIANT WITH THE POLICY H17? NO. Policy H17 requires that \"a conversion scheme should include a unit of 3(+) bedrooms at ground/semi-basement level, with direct access to the rear garden or amenity open space\". The proposal includes a 2-bedroom unit at ground floor with direct access to a rear garden area.\r\r\rPolicy 17 of the Replacement UDP (2006)\r\r1.\tThe original floorspace of property is above 120m2: NO, the application form states that the existing floorspace of the property is 99.10 m2 \r2.\tAcceptable mix: YES\r3.\t2-bedroom (or 3-bedroom Policy H17) flat at ground/basement with direct access to garden: YES\r\rTHE PROPOSAL IS COMPLIANT Policy 17 NO. Policy 17 states that the conversion of dwellings into flats will be permitted where the property has an original, pre-1948 (un-extended) floor area of at least 120sq.m. The property has an existing floorspace area of 99.10 sq.m and is therefore considered unsuitable for conversion purposes.\r\r\rCOMPLIANCE WITH SPG4 ROOM SIZES AND INTERNAL LAYOUT:  NO\rThe proposal fails to comply with the minimum room size requirements contained with Adopted SPG4. The following habitable rooms are considered to be substandard:\r\tThe living/dining/kitchen room to Flat 1 (3 person unit) should be a minimum of 20.5 sq.m. The proposed 16.7 sq.m room is therefore 3.8 sq.m below the minimum requirement.\r\tThe main bedroom to Flat 1 (3 person unit) should be a minimum of 11.2 sq.m. The proposed 10.0 sq.m room is therefore 1.2 sq.m below the minimum requirement.\r\tThe second bedroom to Flat 1 (3 person unit) should be a minimum of 6.5 sq.m. The proposed 5.7sq.m room is therefore 0.8 sq.m below the minimum requirement.\r\r\tThe living/dining/kitchen room to Flat 2 (3 person unit) should be a minimum of 20.5 sq.m. The proposed 19.0 sq.m room is therefore 1.5 sq.m below the minimum requirement.\r\tThe main bedroom to Flat 2 (3 person unit) should be a minimum of 11.2 sq.m. The proposed 11.0 sq.m room is therefore 0.2 sq.m below the minimum requirement.\r\tThe second bedroom to Flat 2 (3 person unit) should be a minimum of 6.5 sq.m. The proposed 6.0sq.m room is therefore 0.5 sq.m below the minimum requirement.\r\r\rEXTENSIONS: NO\r\r \rDESIGN \r\rNo external alterations are proposed as part of the development proposal.\r\r\rIMPACT ON NEIGHBOURS\r\rObjections have been received to the proposal on the grounds of increased loss of privacy and loss of sunlight/daylight to adjoining properties in Woodvale Walk. No extensions are proposed as part of the proposal and therefore there is no possibility of loss of sunlight/daylight to adjoining properties.\r\rThe proposal seeks to reorganise the internal layout to provide an extra unit. However the bedroom windows to the rear of the property at first floor level would be maintained as existing. As such the proposal would not lead to an increased overlooking to the property to the rear of the site (No. 88 Woodvale Walk) which has raised an objection. It is also considered that the proposal would not result in increased overlooking to any other properties in the surrounding area.\r\rHIGHWAYS AND REFUSE:\r\rHighways:\rThe applicant has submitted a Parking Stress Survey with the planning application. The survey shows that parking stress in the area is 43%. The Council's Transport Planner has raised no objections and has stated that even allowing for inaccuracies and other recently permitted developments such as Inglewood residential scheme, this is well below the 90% parking stress which is considered to be the critical elevel.\r\r \rCycle provision:\rIt is noted that the rear garden has an independent access and a purpose built cycle storage area could be constructed although nothing is shown on the submitted drawings.\r\rRefuse:\rThe proposed ground floor plan shows a refuse storage area within the front garden. This is considered to be acceptable and would complies with the requirements of the Council's guidance for Waste and Recycling Storage and Collection Requirements.\r\r\r7. RECOMMENDATION \r\rRefuse planning permission for the following reasons::  \r\r1.\tThe proposal, which involves the subdivision of a dwelling that is below the size considered suitable for conversion to flats, would result in the loss of a small dwelling house for which there is a continued demand within the Borough. As such, the proposal is contrary to Policies H10 and H17 of the Adopted Unitary Development Plan (1998) and to Policy 17 of the Replacement Unitary Development Plan (2006).\r\r2.\tThe proposed flats, by reason of their layout and the size of rooms, would provide substandard accommodation to the detriment of the amenities of future occupiers. As such, the proposal is contrary to Policies H10 and H17 of the Adopted Unitary Development Plan (1998), Policy 17 of the Replacement Unitary Development Plan (2006) and the Council's Adopted Supplementary Planning Guidance 4 'Internal Layout and Room Sizes'.\r\r",
    "Planning History\r\r87/01902 -  Permission was granted on 22 January 1988 for the establishment of the use of the property as five residential units.  (Regd.plan Nos. 21025/1902/87 Applicant's plan Nos. None). \r\rProposed Development\r\rThe subject site contains a large detached building which has been converted into flats. The rear of the property has previously been extended at lower ground floor level and the application \rseeks planning permission for the creation of a roof terrace on the roof of this extension (above the ground floor flat of No. 39 Mount Ephraim Road). The removal of the existing staircase and installation of a galvanised mild steel stair and landing also forms part of the application.  \r\rConsultation\r\rI have consulted the relevant neighbouring properties      \t\t\tYES \r\rI have consulted the appropriate amenity groups and interested parties   \t\tYES\r\rPress Notice\t\t\tNO\r\rSite Notice \t\t\tNO\r\rComments Received     \t\tYes - Two (2) objection response were received. \r\rThe following concerns were raised by objectors:\r\r* Reduced privacy to No. 37c Mount Ephraim Road and No. 1A Mount Ephraim Lane\r* Reduction in sunlight to No. 37c Mount Ephraim Road and No. 1A Mount Ephraim Lane\r* Poor appearance of development\r* Fumes from development affecting No. 1A Mount Ephraim Lane\r* Additional noise impacts to No. 37c Mount Ephraim Road and No. A1 Mount Ephraim Lane\r* Reduction in property and rental values of No. 37c Mount Ephraim Road\r\rOfficer comments to objectors:\r\rIssues relating to amenity such as loss of privacy/overlooking, noise and loss of sunlight are addressed in the planning assessment detailed below. \r\rIt is not considered there was be any adverse impacts on surrounding properties by way of fumes given the site is residential and this would not create any disturbance in this way other than what is usual to a residential use. \r\rIt is an established planning principle that impacts by way of reduced property and rental values are not valid grounds of objection and therefore are not considered as part of the assessment of this application. \r\rPlanning Considerations\r\rAdopted Unitary Development Plan Policies:\rComplies with Adopted Unitary Development Plan policies   \t\t\t\tNO\r\rThe key Policies of relevance are:\rCD2: Proposals for Development\rCD18: Extensions\rH10: Residential Development Standards\rST3: Daylight and sunlight\rST5: Privacy and Space between buildings\rST8: Residential extensions \r\rComplies with Replacement Unitary Development Plan Policies   \t\t\tNO\r\rThe key Policies of relevance are:\rPolicy 33: Alterations and Extensions\rPolicy 42: Conservation Areas\r\rStatus of UDP\r\rThe current up to date statement of the Council's planning policies is contained in the Replacement Lambeth UDP.  This is now at an advanced stage in the process of adoption. Proposed Modifications were placed on deposit ending on 1 December 2006.  The Council's Cabinet, in approving the Proposed Modifications recommended that: \"The Proposed Modifications, together with the unaltered parts of the Revised Deposit UDP, are approved for use for development control purposes\". \rConsiderable weight can now therefore be attached to policies which were not subject to objection at the Proposed Modifications stage and those that were recommended by the Inspector.  \rSupplementary Planning Guidance\r\rComplies with the Council's adopted Guidelines for Residential Extensions and Alterations NO\r\rDesign and Conservation\r\rThere are objections to the proposal on design & conservation grounds \t\t\tNO\r\rThis application related to the formation of a roof terrace for one of the flats above an existing single storey rear extension (part of the lower ground floor flat) and the formation of a new stairwell and landing to the rear of the property which provides access to a communal garden area. \r\rPolicy CD18 of the Adopted UDP states that extensions should normally be confined to the rear or least important facades, and any extensions should be in scale with the building and the space around it. The height and form of the extension should be in keeping with the building and its setting. H10 (ST8) of the Adopted UDP states that Council will consider applications for planning permission for residential extensions on their own merits, but pay particular attention to sitting, height and bulk. Policy 33M1 of the Replacement UDP states that rear extensions should not undermine the uniform or characterful appearance of houses. Significant changes in the height, depth, shape or appearance of the rear elevation will be resisted. \r\rGenerally the design of the proposal is acceptable with galvanised steal stairs and balustrade as well as timber balustrade and translucent glass panels to the terrace are acceptable and would not compromise the integrity of the host building or its surrounds. \r\rAmenity Impact\r\rSection ST8 within Policy H10 of the Replacement UDP states that planning permission will only be granted for extensions, which result in the creation of roof terraces where these would not result in any significant loss of amenity to habitable rooms and/or gardens of neighbouring dwellings by virtue of overlooking. Section ST5 of H10 also notes that balconies and roof gardens will normally only be acceptable where they do not directly overlook a habitable room or garden. It is also noted in the Council's SPG that balconies and roof terraces will not generally be acceptable if it would reduce neighbours privacy by overlooking windows or parts of adjoining rear gardens.\r\rPolicy 33 of the Replacement UDP both seek extensions to dwellings that will not have a detrimental impact on neighbouring properties or visual amenities, particular attention will be paid to siting, height, bulk, scale/design in relation to surrounding buildings, overlooking and loss of daylight/sunlight. \r\rDirectly to the rear of the land are garages that are associated with properties along Mount Ephraim Lane, to either side of these are the rear gardens of residential properties also facing Mount Ephraim Lane. The proposed roof terrace on the extension poses some issues with respect to the privacy/overlooking of adjoining residential allotments gardens. Roof terraces and outdoor balconies are generally discouraged due to their impact on the privacy of surrounding residents. Although the applicant has tried to address issues of overlooking to the adjacent property at No. 37 Mount Ephraim Road and to a lesser extent No's 1A and 1B Mount Ephraim Lane through the installation of sandblasted glass screens (which would obscure any opportunity for overlooking directly into these properties) views into other residential properties will still be available, materially impacting on the amenity of these properties. The application is therefore contrary to the key objectives of Policy H10 of the Adopted UDP and Policy 33 of the Replacement UDP. \r\rIt is not considered there development would result in adverse impacts by way of noise to the lower ground floor flat which is situated below the proposed roof terrace. The application has indicated that the roof is to be protected by timber decking however no noise attenuation measures appear to be included to ensure residents within the flat below are protected, it is considered this would be addressed by the relevant building controls. \r\rRecommendation\r\rRefuse planning permission.\r\r",
    "Please provide plans and elevations in context with 26 Acland Crescent, ensuring to show the positions of any windows and doors.",
    "Please provide the fee for this application of £95.\r\rYour application says you are applying for four fascia signs but the plans provided only show three. Please amend accordingly.\r\rPlease provide plans at a scale of 1:100.\r\rPlease provide details regarding the method of illumination.",
    "In deciding to grant planning permission, the Council has had regard to the relevant policies of the development plan and all other relevant material considerations. The development plan in Lambeth is the Lambeth Local Development Framework Core Strategy (adopted 19 January 2011) and the remaining saved policies in the ‘Lambeth Unitary Development Plan (UDP) 2007: Policies saved beyond 5 August 2010 and not superseded by the Core Strategy adopted in January 2011’ and the London Plan (‘consolidated with Alterations since 2004’ published in February 2008). Having weighed the merits of the proposal in the context of these issues, it is considered that planning permission should be granted subject to the conditions listed below. In reaching this decision Policies 36 (Alterations and Extensions) and 47 (Conservation Areas) were relevant.",
    "8.0\tCONCLUSION:\r\r8.1\tIt is considered that the proposal is acceptable in terms of minimising any crime or perceived crime in the locality in compliance with Policy S9 of the Core Strategy and Policy 32 of the Unitary Development Plan.\r\r8.2\tIt is considered that the proposed telephone call box is designed so as to blend into the public realm without causing any extra items of clutter and is therefore in compliance with Policies 39 and 55 of the Unitary Development Plan.\r\r8.3\tIt is considered that the proposal does not materially affect the adjacent conservation areas and improves the setting of the nearby Grade II listed building and is therefore in compliance with Policies 45 and 47 of the Unitary Development Plan.\r\r\r9.0\tRECOMMENDATION:\r\rIt is the recommendation that Prior Approval is granted as it has been assessed against Government guidance, public consultation and meets the following relevant policies of the Core Strategy and UDP (including assessment of its siting and appearance).\r\rCore Strategy\r\rPolicy S9\tQuality of the Built Environment\r\rLondon Borough of Lambeth Unitary Development Plan 2007: Policies saved beyond 5th August 2010 and not superseded by the Local Development Framework Core Strategy 2011.\r\rPolicy 32\tCommunity Safety/Designing Out Crime\rPolicy 39\tStreetscape, Landscape and Public Realm Design\rPolicy 45\tListed Buildings\rPolicy 47\tConservation Areas\rPolicy 55\tTelecommunications Development\r",
    "The proposed roof terrace and its associated safety balustrade by reason of its design and siting would be prominent addition and introduce an incongruous form of development at roof level and result in significant harm to the character of the host building and the wider terrace. The development would set a negative precedent on this section of Pulross Road which is unacceptable. The proposal would be contrary to Policy Q5 and Q11 of the Lambeth Local Plan 2015 and Building Alterations and Extensions SPD 2015.",
    "By reason of its siting, the use of the proposed roof terrace for recreational purposes would have a harmful impact on residential amenity in terms of excessive noise and disturbance to adjacent properties, in particularly the flats at nos. 26 and 28 Pulross Road. Furthermore the use of the roof terrace would have an unacceptable harmful impact on privacy as a result of overlooking from the terrace into habitable rear first floor windows at nos. 25 and 26 Pulross Road contrary to Policy Q2 of the Lambeth Local Plan 2015.",
    "Your attention is drawn to the need to comply with the requirements of the Control of Pollution Act 1974 concerning construction site noise and in this respect you are advised to contact the Council's Environmental Health Division.",
