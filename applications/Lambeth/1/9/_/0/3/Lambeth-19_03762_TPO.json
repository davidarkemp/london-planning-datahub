  "description": "TPO: 222 T4: London Plane T5: Lime Tree T6: London Plane. To the best of my knowledge these are the TPO and tree numbers for the trees I own on my land at 53E Guildersfield Road SW16 5LS. The schedule of tree preservations orders is not very detailed for my address, it just says Guildersfield Road St Andrews Church which no longer exists, this land now is housing with different house numbers. I do know that I have two London Planes and a Lime tree on my property so can only assume they are correct details above. I am asking for permission to pollard all three trees to about half height whilst still keeping them tree looking. The afore mentioned trees are far to big for there location and require extensive pruning. They are currently blocking out light to myself and neighbours and branches are starting to fall off into mine and neighbouring gardens. A number of neighbours have recently inquired whether I can do something about them for the above reasons. I do not wish to remove the trees totally but only to pollard them. I own a strip of land beside by house where the trees can safely cut with minimal risk to neighbouring property etc. I will not be replacing any of the trees as they will not be totally felled and will continue to grow. I am not sure of the year but in the past you have given me permission to carry out the above works on two of the trees due to the above reasons.",
