  "description": "Variation of Conditions 2 (approved plans) and 3 (materials) of planning permission 15/05835/FUL (Extension of St Stephen's Children's Centre and associated works to external spaces and site boundary.) Granted on: 23/12/2015.\r\rVariation sought:\rRemoval of the sedum roof and replacement with a bitumen membrane roof finish.\r\rVariation sought: \r\rCondition Number(s): 2. The development hereby permitted shall be carried out in accordance with the approved plans listed in this notice.\r\r3 The proposed materials to be used for the external surfaces of the development hereby permitted shall match those of the existing building. All new works and works of making good to the retained fabric shall be finished to match the adjacent work with regards to the methods used and to material, colour, texture and profile, unless the prior written approval of the local planning authority is obtained to any variation, or except where otherwise stated on the approved drawings.\r\rConditions(s) Removal:\r\rThe Design and Access Statement submitted as part of the Planning Application states in section 5.4 that 'A sedum green roof is proposed for the extension.'  \r\rAfter discussion with representatives from Lambeth Council and the stakeholders using and maintaining the Children's Centre it has become clear that the risk to human safety and expense involved in maintaining a sedum roof at the proposed height is difficult to justify in this case.  This is balanced against the fact that the roof is not visible from any part of the surrounding buildings or area due to its height and it being surrounded by a parapet on all sides.\rRemoval of the sedum roof and replacement with a bitumen membrane roof finish.",
