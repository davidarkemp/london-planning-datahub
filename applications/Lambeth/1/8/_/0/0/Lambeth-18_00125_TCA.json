  "description": "There are 2 large trees within the garden of 1 Stockwell Terrace. London. SW9 0QD.\r\rThe one nearest the house is over 10 metres tall, is too close to the house at less than 10 metres and is hollow at the base.\r\rThis problem has only recently been identified and I suggest that it is dangerous to the public as it is next to the A3 and also the Grade 2 listed building of Stockwell Terrace is at risk of damage should this tree break.\r\rIt therefore needs to be removed or radically reduced.",
