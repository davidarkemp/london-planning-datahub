(Recommended on the basis that the tree is excessively large for the location, very close to the properties and the garden contains too many trees).\rT4 - Sycamore - (Self-seeded). Fell to ground level and treat stump to prevent future regrowth. (Recommended on the basis that the tree is excessively large for the location, very close to the properties and the garden contains too many trees).\rT5 - Ash - Reduce crown back to previous points of reduction, leaving some furnishing growth.\rT6 - Lime - Fell to ground level and treat stump to prevent future regrowth. The tree is completely destroying the front boundary wall, which is now leaning at 30-40 degrees and is potentially dangerous. Owners of adjacent flat complain about loss of light.\rT7 - Privet Hedge - Reduce to a level height, starting at 6ft from pavement end. Cut back from pavement to boundary wall and hard cut back side over No.3.",
