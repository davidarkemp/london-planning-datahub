  "description": "Single flowering cherry tree.\rPlease note that this tree was not the variety which planning permission was given for in the original application when the houses were being built .  The approved variety I understand was a japanese type called \"shirotae\".\rI would like the option to remove or kill it.  This is because it has grown too big for its space at the front of the house.  The impact of this is:\r\r1.)  Its roots have lifted all the earth/slate chippings surrounding it and lifted the paving stones leading to the front of the house.\r2.)  It is blocking out a significal amount of light to the ground floor living room.\r3.)  There is a risk that its roots will cause the light well wall to crack.\r\rCurrent options I am considering are (i) to kill off the tree and grow a rose up and through its branches (ii) to landscape the front with shrubs and a smaller standard tree.",
