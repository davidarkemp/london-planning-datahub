  "description": "T1-London Plane\rLarge mature tree in close proximity to building and extending over footpaths and busy road.\r\rSuggested works are to thin crown by 20%, concentrating on branch ends. Lift crown to statutory height of 6m over road, ensure a balanced crown. Prune lateral spread to ensure a 4m clearance from building. Prune to provide sufficient clearance from lamppost.\r\rThe reasons for these works are to improve light to surrounding windows and properties, improve air flow through out canopy and reduce wind sail area. As well as to clear adjacent building and road.",
