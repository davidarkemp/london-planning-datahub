    "The proposed 'annexe' would, by virtue of its scale and bulk including its excessive footprint and depth and its bland and basic design including a flat roof, would appear as an insubordinate and incongruous addition to the property that would be discordant with the existing dwelling and would not appear as  ancillary to the main dwelling, would detract from the setting of the host dwelling and would constitute overdevelopment of the application site which would harm the character of the site and the wider area. The application is therefore contrary to Policy 36 of the Lambeth Unitary Development Plan (2007) and the Supplementary Planning Document for Residential Alterations and Extensions (2007).",
