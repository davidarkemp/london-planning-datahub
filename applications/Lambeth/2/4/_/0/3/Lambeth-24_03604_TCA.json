  "description": "T1 and T2 Acers:\rThe buttress roots of these trees are disrupting the artificial pitch, creating hazardous trip risks for children. Additionally, branch failures pose a safety concern. The trees have outgrown their location, and their removal is necessary to renew the play area with a safe, durable surface.\r\rT3 Poplar:\rThis tree shows significant crown dieback and a large dead section, indicating its decline. Repeated branch failures elevate the risk to children, making it unsuitable for retention in a high-use playground.\r\rT4 Oak:\rDespite its ecological value, this oak is problematic in its current location. Falling acorns create slipping hazards, and ongoing dead wooding is required to mitigate risks. Its roots are also disrupting the playground, necessitating removal to ensure a safe, low-maintenance environment.\r\rT5 Sycamore:\rGrowing out of the hedgerow, this semi-mature tree is overshadowing the hedgerow?s growth. Its removal supports long-term ecological health and avoids future conflicts.\r\rT6 Eucalyptus:\rThis young tree is unsuitable due to its rapid growth, invasive roots, and high water uptake, which are incompatible with a playground. Early removal prevents future damage and disruption.\r\rT7, T8 & T9 Ash Trees:\rThese trees create excessive shade, fallen leaves, and deadwood, resulting in maintenance issues and slippery surfaces that limit playground usability. Their removal enhances safety, improves light and air circulation, and aligns with Lambeth?s tree policy.\r\r\rAlignment with Lambeth Tree Policy and Environmental Considerations\rThe proposal aligns with Lambeth?s tree policy by addressing public safety, sustainability, and renewal.\r\rSafety and Accessibility:\rThe trees pose risks such as trip hazards, falling branches, and slippery surfaces, compromising children?s safety. Removal aligns with the policy?s safety priorities.\r\rSustainability and Long-Term Planning:\rThe trees have outgrown their locations, causing significant disruption. Their removal enabl",
