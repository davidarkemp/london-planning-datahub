Reduce the height of the main upright stem by 3m to suitable growth points. Reduce the southeast-facing stem by 2.5m to appropriate growth points to maintain a balanced, rounded form. Remove any dead branches. These tree works will decrease the tree height from 14m to 11m above ground level and reduce the crown spread from 9m to 7.5m.\rBack Garden within the Clapham Conservation Area:\rT2: Magnolia grandiflora: The current height of the tree is 9 meters, with a crown spread of 6 meters. Following the proposed tree works the height will be reduced to 6 meters while maintaining a crown spread of 6 meters.\r",
