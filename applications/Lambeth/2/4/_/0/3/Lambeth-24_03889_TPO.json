  "description": "TPO No. 38, May 6, 1975, T2 Horse Chestnut:  \rT10 (Horse Chestnut) - Pollard to 12m and repeat at 2-year intervals for a period of 10 years.  \rThe reasons for the application are (and must be verbatim) as follows:  \rThe property has been subject to a form of cracking indicative of downward movement of foundations.  \rEngineers are of the opinion that the movement of the building is consistent with that induced by tree-induced moisture abstraction of an underlying clay soil.  \rLevel monitoring has confirmed seasonal movement in the orientation of these 2 trees.  \rIt is hoped that pruning of T10 can reduce the influence and retain the tree [T14 Oak application number 25/00777/TPO and T10].  \rT14 has a Ganoderma infection.  \rNote: The lack of a full suite of site investigations is recognized. The attached approach is seeking to retain T10.",
