This language has been proposed on the other two external doors - to the storage area and blacking shed.\rThe proposed roof arrangement to the storage area and blacking shed has been amended to a dual pitch roof and kept separate from the machine room roof. This is due to differing pitch between the two roofs.\rThe number of rooflights in the machine room roof has been reduced to 2.\rTwo rooflights have been added to the storage room.\rOne rooflight had been added to the blacking shed.\rThe narrow window to the blacking shed has been removed.\rThe window to the secure storage area has been removed.\rThe GF WC arrangement has been modified to provide an additional, unisex WC.\rThe existing, non-compliant stair is proposed to be replaced with a Part M compliant stair and moved towards the centre of the building. This will allow a better use of the space in the first floor show room area.\rThe front boundary wall to Clapham Manor Street is proposed to be amended to have a low level brick wall with taller brick piers add to define a wider entrance. The existing railings will be modified and re-used and the walls / piers will have stone copings.\r",
