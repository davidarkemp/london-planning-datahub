The extended two storey closet was also altered with a door at ground level and a window above. A garage was also created within the side extension. It does not appear that these were constructed wholly in line with the approved plans, there is variation in some of the window and door elements and the lower ground floor conservatory was not constructed.\nText shown herein is from PrePlanning report provided by Lambeth: ref: 24/02245/PREAPP",
