  "description": "The tree in question is an Oak tree located in the front garden at 267 Kennington Road. It is currently the only tree present in this front garden. \r\rThe application is to fell this Oak tree. The principle reason for felling is its proximity to the building structure of 267 Kennington Road and neighbouring properties. The tree is around 5m from the property and has a huge growth potential (around 45m in height). The beautiful terraced houses on Kennington Road are rightly conserved and as this tree grows its root system could disrupt the foundations of these properties. In addition, the base of the tree already lies very close to the old coal storage areas underneath the front garden where root damage is likely to start affecting the brickwork. Furthermore, this large tree and close proximity does and will cause excessive shading to the surrounding properties.\r\rOnce felled, a new Cherry tree with a reduced growth potential will be planted in its place (height potential 4-8m). In my opinion this will provide an improved visual appearance of the conservation area and reduce the impact of structural damage within the conservation area.",
