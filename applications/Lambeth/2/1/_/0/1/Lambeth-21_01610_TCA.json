  "description": "Trees T1-T5 are conifers and have been reduced in height, as was necessary to make them safe owing to previous storm damage leaving 3 of the tops hung-up in the canopy. This was carried out as emergency works owing to the close proximity of the pavement and neighbouring property and the imminent danger of these detaching from the canopy and falling to the ground. It is now requested that trees T1 through 5 have the sides of the canopy reduced in size by 25%-30% to bring the trees back into a natural shape. \rWe also request permission to reduce the canopy of Trees T6 and T7 (Pittosporum) by up to 30% and to remove the branches that are overhanging the pavement.\"",
