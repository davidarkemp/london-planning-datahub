  "description": "Crab Apple (T1) to be felled. Halfway up the trunk is a large wound from  when  a limb was removed. On inspection it was clear the tree had not sealed it off and I  could probe into the two inch  wound straight into the heart of the tree. It's a matter of time before disease sets in and the tree will  become unstable. The family have two small children who play on the garden and they would like the tree removed before it becomes a hazard.",
