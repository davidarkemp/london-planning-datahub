    "Officer Report\r\r1. Site Description\r\r1.1\tThe site contains a two storey commercial building adjacent to train tracks on the western side of Pensbury Place. The site is located in the Vauxhall Opportunity Area and the Wandsworth Road Key Industrial and Business Area. It is located adjacent to the Wandsworth Road Conservation Area.  The surrounding area is predominantly commercial.\r\r2.\tRelevant Planning History \r\r2.1\tThe relevant planning history is listed below:\r\r16/06517/FUL - Retention of plant equipment and proposed acoustic screen associated with existing industrial premises. Granted\r\r92/01468/PLANAP - Change of use from a wholesale warehouse (personal to Kosmos Book Distributors Ltd) to light industry. (Regd. Plan Nos.29804/92/1468. Applicant's plan nos site plan unnumbered). Granted\r\r88/02129/ PLANAP - Erection of a 2 storey side extension to provide additional office/showroom space and car parking. Refused\r\r87/00733/PLANAP - Erection of a portakabin at rear of car park to provide additional office space for existing adjoining book distributors. Granted \r\r3.\tProposal \r\r3.1\tReplacement of an existing window with the Installation of a new pedestrian doorway to the front elevation of Industrial Premises.\r\r4.\tConsultations\r\r4.1\tPublic consultation was undertaken in accordance with statutory procedure and no responses were received from the neighbours consulted.\r\r4.2\tThe Council's conservation team have not objected to the proposal as the proposed works are very minor and considered unlikely to harm the character and appearance of the nearby Wandsworth Road Conservation Area. \r\r5.\tLambeth Local Plan (2015): \r\rPolicy Q2: Amenity \rPolicy Q8 Design Quality: Construction Detailing \rPolicy Q11: Building Alterations and Extensions \rPolicy Q22: Conservation Areas\rPolicy ED1: Key Industrial and Business Areas\r\rBuilding Alterations and Extensions SPD 2015\r \rDesign\r\r5.1\tLocal Plan Policy Q5 states that the local distinctiveness of Lambeth should be sustained and reinforced through new development and that proposals will be supported where it is shown that design of development is a response to positive aspects of the local context and historic character in terms of: (i) urban block and grain, patterns of space and relationship, townscape/landscape character; (ii) built form (bulk, scale, height and massing) including roofscapes.\r\r5.2\tLocal Plan Policy Q11 states that when considering proposals for the alteration or extensions of buildings the council will generally expect proposals:(i) to have a design which positively responds to the original architecture, roof form, detailing, fenestration (including design, materials and means of opening) of the host building and other locally distinct forms (such as group characteristics); such features should be respected, retained and where necessary on heritage assets authentically reproduced;\r\r5.3\tLocal Plan Policy Q22 states that development proposals affecting conservation areas will be permitted where they preserve or enhance the character and appearance of the conservation area by (i) respecting and reinforcing the established, positive characteristics of the area in terms of the building line, siting, design, height, forms, materials joinery, window detailing etc. and (ii) protecting the setting (including views in and out of the area).\r\r5.4\t The removal of the existing window on the front elevation of the building and the replacement with a door is considered to be a minor change to the building which would have no unacceptable impact on the character of the adjacent conservation area.  The Council's conservation officer has not objected to the proposal.\r\rAmenity\r\r5.5\tPolicy Q2 of the Lambeth Local Plan requires development to not have an unacceptable impact on the amenity of surrounding properties with regard to sense of enclosure and loss of sunlight, daylight, outlook and privacy.\r\r5.7\tQ2(v) requires the adverse impact of noise to be reduced to an unacceptable level through the use of attenuation, distance, screening, or internal layout. Furthermore, (vii) states that service equipment should be fully integrated into the building envelope or located in visually inconspicuous locations within effective and robust screening/enclosures, and does not cause disturbance through its operation.\r\r5.8\tGiven that neither the footprint nor the height of the building would change as a result of the proposal, it is not considered that any amenity impacts would arise in terms of sense of enclosure or loss of sunlight, daylight, outlook or privacy at the neighbouring properties.\r\r5.9         It is considered that the proposal would not have an unreasonable impact on neighbouring amenity thus complying with Policy Q2 of the Lambeth District Plan.\r\r6.\tConclusion\r\r6.1\tUpon full assessment of the submitted material supporting the application, it is considered that the objectives of relevant policies of the Council's Local Plan (2015) have been met.\r\r7.\tRecommendation\r\r7.1\tGrant Planning Permission\r",
    "The proposal would have complied with the conditions, limitations and/or restrictions applicable to development permitted by Schedule 2, Part 1, Class D of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 2015 (as amended) at the date of the application."
