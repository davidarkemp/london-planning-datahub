  "description": "Sycamore (top right corner, NE) - trim branches/pollard because of excessive shading of my garden and next door's garden as well as hanging low over the rear wall which surrounds the allotment. Ash (right side of the garden close to fence) - trim top because it has exceeded the height of the building - 3 stories - and sways in the wind. I believe that left to get much taller it can pose a hazard and at this height has low amenity value. Also x3 Ash close together in garden on left overhanging my garden - trim/pollard because of excessive shading and lack of attention meaning 3 trees are very large and close together with one growing at an unstable angle.",
