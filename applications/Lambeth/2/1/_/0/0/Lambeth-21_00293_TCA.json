  "description": "Number references relate to trees as marked on the Tree plan. All the trees specified below require work to be done in order to reduce excessive shading and allow new hedging and new shade tolerant trees to grow underneath. In addition, trees 2,3,4,5 7,8 and 9 overhang the public pavement and need to be cut back as close as possible to the fence line. The objective is to replace the existing undergrowth, which is a mess, with hedging and small trees to provide privacy to our front garden and to prevent the area being used as a rubbish tip and toilet area by the passing general public. \r1. Sycamore (Acer pseudoplatanus) TPO T37. Crown reduce by 15% back to cutting points established by works undertaken under 16/05723/TPO \r2. Holly ( Ilex aquifolium Variegata)TPO T36. Raise crown to 3 meters above ground level. Minor work on top of crown to height established by works carried out under 12/00332/TCA. Cut back overhang of pavement.  \r3. Yew (Taxus baccata)TPO T33. Raise crown to 3 meters above ground level. Reduce height of crown to level established by works carried out under 12/00332/TCA. Reduce width of tree along length of fence and on garden side to reduce overhanging and allow underplanting.  \r4. Conifer (Juniperus communis). Raise crown to 4 meters. Minor top work on crown. Remove dead branches. Reduce width by 1.5m to prevent overhanging of pavement.\r5. Conifer (Junirerus communis). Raise crown to 4 meters above pavement level. Minor top work on crown. Remove dead branches. Reduce width by 1.5m to prevent overhanging of pavement.\r6. Box tree (Buxus sempervirens). Misshapen in growth habit. Fell because of low amenity value. \r7. Holly (Ilex aquifolium). Raise crown to 3 meters above ground level. Cut back to reduce overhanging of public pavement and overhang of garden area\r8. Holly (Ilex aquifolium). Raise crown to 3 meters.. Cut back to reduce overhanging of public pavement and garden area.\r9. Bay ( Laurus nobilis). Raise crown to 3 meters above ground level.",
