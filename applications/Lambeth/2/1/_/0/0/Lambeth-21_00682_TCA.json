A report commissioned in 2015 confirmed evidence of degradation by a parasitic organism (see attachments).\rRecently sought x2 inspections from independent arboriculturists with both recommending immediate felling (see attachments).\rI was also advised that the size and nature of removing the stump will prohibit planting a tree in the same position.",
