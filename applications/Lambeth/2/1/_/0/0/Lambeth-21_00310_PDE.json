    "1.\tSITE AND SURROUNDINGS\r\t\r1.1\tThe application site comprises a two-storey mid-terraced dwellinghouse which is located on the northern side of Lillieshall Road. To the rear the property has an existing two-storey rear return, with a lean-to extension off the rear return.\r\r1.2\tThe application site contains a Grade II Listed Building and is located within the Clapham Conservation Area. The property is considered to make a positive contribution to the character and appearance of the Conservation Area.  \r\r\r2.\tPROPOSALS\r\r2.1\tThe application seeks full planning permission for the erection of a single-storey ground floor rear and side extension, demolition of existing masonry wall in rear outrigger to make a connection with new extension, the reconstruction and enlargement of outside lean-to toilet and addition to provide a connection with the new extension. The application also seek approval for the removal of a wall at first floor level to existing toilet, blocking up existing opening into bathroom and the addition of an opening and jib door to existing stud wall between the bedroom and bathroom on the first floor.\r\r2.2\tThe proposed rear and side infill extension would be to the side of the existing two-storey rear return and would be set back 0.10 metres from the end of the rear return. The extension to the side of the existing lean-to structure would terminate 0.30 metres from the end of the rear return also. Both extensions would be visually lightweight to the rear with glazing introduced across the rear and side elevations. The rear and side infill extension would be finished with a glazed roof, whilst the extension to the rear of the rear return will be finished in a shallow pitched roof set behind a parapet.\r\r2.3\tAmended plans were received during the consideration of the application which removed the previously proposed interventions at ground floor level to the front living room and at first floor level to the space above the staircase at the rear of the property. The amendments also replaced the previously proposed larger opening from the bedroom into the bathroom, to a smaller opening with a jib door which would be largely invisible when shut. The other amendments introduced a slight set back of the proposed rear and side infill extension from the end of the original rear return and increased the height of the glazing at the rear. These were all made following officer comments.\r\r\r3.\tRELEVANT PLANNING HISTORY\r\r3.1\t15/01536/LB: Erection of a single storey ground floor rear side extension, demolition of existing masonry wall in rear outrigger to make a connection with new conservatory, reconstruction and enlargement of outside lean-to toilet and addition to provide a connection with new conservatory. Removal of a wall at first floor level to existing toilet, blocking up existing opening into bathroom and the addition of an opening and jib door to existing stud wall between the bedroom and bathroom on the first floor. [Town Planning and Listed Building]. (Pending Consideration)\r\r\r4.\tCONSULTATIONS\r\r4.1\tPublic consultation was undertaken in accordance with statutory requirements and no responses were received.\r\r4.2\tThe following amenity groups/external stakeholders/internal consultees were notified of the application:\r\r\tClapham Society - No response\r\tBrixton Town Centre Manager - No response\rConservation & Design - Originally objected to the application. Had raised concerns with the proposed rear and side infill extension as originally proposed, which was to finish flush with the original rear return and would have had a large proportion of brickwork to the rear elevations. This has now been set back to give visual superiority to the original rear return and the level of glazing to the rear has been increased. Concerns were also raised with regard to the originally proposed openings at ground floor level to the front living room and at first floor level from the bedroom to the bathroom and also from the bathroom into the space currently used as storage located above the staircase. The opening at ground floor has been removed from the proposal, as has the opening from the bathroom into the space above the staircase. The opening from the bedroom into the bathroom has been reduced to a single door, which would be a jib door. When shut this door would largely be hidden into the wall. Following these amendments the Conservation and Design officer raised no objections.\r\r\r5.\tRELEVANT POLICIES AND PLANNING CONSIDERATIONS\r\r5.1\tThe proposal has been considered against national planning policy, the Development Plan and associated Supplementary Planning Documents (SPD).  The following is an assessment of compliance with the relevant Development Plan policies and SPDs.\r\rLambeth Local Development Framework (LDF) Core Strategy (2011):\rPolicy S9: Quality of the Built Environment - Complies\r\rLondon Borough of Lambeth Unitary Development Plan (UDP) (2007): Policies saved beyond 5 August 2010 and not superseded by the LDF Core Strategy January 2011:\rPolicy 36: Alterations & Extensions - Complies\rPolicy 45: Listed Buildings - Complies\rPolicy 47: Conservation Areas - Complies\r\rSupplementary Planning Document (SPD): \rResidential Extensions and Alterations - Complies\r\t\rConservation and Design\r\r5.2\tThe overarching aim of relevant planning policy is to ensure that alterations and extensions to listed buildings do not harm the special interest of the listed building.  Generally, they are expected to be subordinate to the original building. Extensions to properties must be considered to appear subordinate to the host property in order for them to be supported. Extensions in the area to the side of the rear return should be largely lightweight in appearance with a high level of glazing to the rear elevation and roof. They should also be set back slightly from the end of the rear return to give the rear return visual prominence. The same detailing should apply to extensions to the back of the rear return.\r\r5.3\tIt is noted that similar extensions exist at other properties along Lillieshall Road, most notably at the neighbouring properties at No. 12 and at No. 16. These were both approved under the current policies and guidance.\r\r5.4\tIt is considered that the extensions as proposed would appear subordinate to the host property given that these would be visually lightweight and would be set back from both the rear and side of the original rear return. As such the important architectural and historic feature at the rear of the terrace will not be unacceptably impacted on.\r\r5.5\tVarious internal works are proposed at ground and first floor level in order to provide access to the proposed extensions and at first floor level to provide access from the front bedroom into the bathroom. The proposed openings at ground floor level are considered to not unacceptably harm the special historic interest of the building. This is also the case for the proposed closure of the existing opening into the bathroom at first floor level together with the proposed new opening from the bedroom into the bathroom given that this would be finished with a jib door, which when shut will be largely hidden from view. \r\r5.6\tGiven the above the proposed development is considered to be in compliance with the relevant design policy and guidance and is considered to preserve the character and appearance of the Clapham Conservation Area. \r\rAmenity\r\r5.7\tSaved Policy 36 of the UDP seeks to ensure that development does not have an unacceptable impact upon residential amenity of neighbouring properties, particularly in terms of the receipt of sunlight and daylight, overlooking and privacy and the creation of a sense of enclosure.  \r\r5.8\tIt is noted that the proposed extensions at the application site would not be greater in depth than the adjacent extensions that exist at both of the neighbouring properties at 12 and 16 Lillieshall Road. It is therefore considered that the proposed development would not have an unacceptable impact on the surrounding properties.\r\r\r6. \tCONCLUSION\r\r6.1 \tUpon full assessment of the submitted material supporting the application, it is considered that the objectives of relevant policies of the Council's Core Strategy (2011) and Unitary Development Plan: Policies saved beyond 5 August 2010 and not superseded by the LDF Core Strategy January 2011 have been met.\r\r\r7.\tRECOMMENDATION\r\r7.1\tGrant Planning Permission.\r\r",

    "The proposal, due to the height and proximity to the boundary with 21 Harpenden Road, is likely to result in unacceptable visual intrusion and enclosure of the neighbouring rear garden. The application has not demonstrated that the proposal would retain acceptable levels of daylight and sunlight and avoid unacceptable overshadowing to the rear garden space. The proposal would fail to comply with Policy Q2 of the Local Plan (2015).",
