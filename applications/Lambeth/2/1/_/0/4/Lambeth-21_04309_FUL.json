    "The proposed development results in the loss of an existing self-contained unit. No exceptional circumstances have been demonstrated, therefore the development fails to comply with Policy H3 of the Lambeth Local Plan (2021).",
    "1.\tAPPLICATION\n1.1\tApproval of details pursuant to condition 38 (Fire Statement) of Planning Application Ref: 19/03546/FUL (Redevelopment of the site involving the erection of a 5 storey building comprising light industrial floorspace (Use Class B1(c)) on the ground floor and 17 residential units (Use Class C3) on the upper floors with provision for cycle parking, refuse and recycling storage and landscaping.) Granted on 19.07.2021.\n2.\tCONDITION \n2.1\tThe relevant condition states:\n38. No above ground development shall commence until a Fire Statement has been submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority. The Fire Statement shall be produced by a suitably competent and qualified person which shall detail the building's construction, methods, products and materials used; the means of escape for all building users including those who are disabled or require level access together with the associated management plan; access for fire service personnel and equipment; ongoing maintenance and monitoring and how provision will be made within the site to enable fire appliances to gain access to the building. The development shall thereafter be carried out in accordance with the approved details, and to the satisfaction of current Building Regulations. \nReason: In order to provide a safe and secure development (Policy D12 of the London Plan (2021)).\n2.2\tThe relevant policies to be considered for this application are those stated in the reasons for the condition as above.\n3.\tCONSULTATION\nBuilding Control\nComments Received - 11.05.2023\n\nThere is no named individual Author of the report and reference to supporting Fire Safety experience and qualifications.\n\nI concur with 5.2 in that;\no\tIt is reasonable to assume that the existing highways offers suitable access and standing point for an appliance.\no\tThat a final assembly point is not required for residential flats, but that the park space in close proximity could be used informally in the unlikely event of an all-out evacuation.\no\tAlso that the commercial tenant in due course under the RRO and HSW Act would need to have suitable fire evacuation and assembly procedures.\n\nI concur with 6.2 insomuch as\no\tThe Automatic Fire detection to the private dwelling's and common parts,  Automatic Water Fire Water Suppression system (AWFSS) to the dwellings and ancillary accommodation, and automatic smoke controls to the common parts are mandated as minimum requirements with the recognised guidance under Building Regulations.\nHowever, \no\tAutomatic Water Fire Suppression System (AWFSS),to the commercial parts designed to BS 12845 should also be provided where the accommodation is sited below sprinklered residential accommodation.  Consideration should be given to this requirement to ensure suitable space and locations to accommodate plant both systems.  Even where the final layout is not known, conservative provisions should be made to ensure that the final requirements can be met.\no\tAWFSS is a life safety system requiring secondary back-up power, and consideration should also be given to making suitable provision.\n\nIn response to 7.2 \no\tIt appears that there may be missing information in place of the message \"Error! Reference source not found.\"\no\tThe floor plan suggests an intention to provide unprotected internal hallways with overall maximum travel from any farthest point in the flat (including balconies) being no greater than 20m.  Whilst this is acceptable due to the provision of AWFSS, it is not made clear in the Fire strategy document.\no\tThe unprotected area calculations for the residential units does not cover the elevations for commercial premises at ground floor.\no\tThe report does not reference firestopping and cavity closers etc… to inhibit fire spread.\n\nI note the comments in 8.2, but have nothing to add.\n\nIn response to 9.2, I would advise that the latest ADB Vol 1 2022 amendments include;\no\tPremises Information Boxes are now required to be provided to new residential buildings over 11m\no\tWayfinding signage is also required to new residential builds over 11m\n\nIn response to 10.2\no\tFor clarity, the maximum hose reach should include the balcony, if reflecting the greatest distance within any individual flat, however the maximum length can actually be extended to 60m in this instance as the flats are protected by AWFSS, so the overall reach is more than satisfactory.\n\nOfficer Comment: The applicant's agent was contact by email and an amended Fire Statement was received on 8 June. Building Control were subsequently re-consulted on 12 June 2023. No response was received to this re-consultation, however Officers have assessed the amended Fire Statement and it was considered that the concerns set out in the Building Control Officer's comments had been addressed. The Planning Officer subsequently requested another amended Fire Statement because the statement made no reference to policy D12 A of the London Plan. The amended (final) Fire Statement was provided by email on 31 July 2023. \n\nL.F.C.D Authority\nConsulted on 27.03.2023 - No response\n\nHealth And Safety Executive Fire Risk\nNo comment. \n\n4.\tCONCLUSION\n4.1\tThe original submission did not include reference to policy D12 A of the London Plan. Following officer advice, an amended Fire Statement was provided by email on 31 July 2023. \n4.2\tPolicy D12 of the London Plan (2021) states that - \nA. In the interest of fire safety and to ensure the safety of all building users, all development proposals must achieve the highest standards of fire safety and ensure that they: \n1.\tIdentify suitably positioned unobstructed outside space: \na.\tFor fire appliances to be positioned on \nb.\tAppropriate for use as an evacuation assembly point \n\n2.\tAre designed to incorporate appropriate features which reduce the risk to life and the risk of serious injury in the event of a fire; including appropriate fire alarm systems and passive and active fire safety measures; \n\n3.\tAre constructed in an appropriate way to minimise the risk of fire spread; \n\n4.\tProvide suitable and convenient means of escape, and associated evacuation strategy for all building users; \n\n5.\tDevelop a robust strategy for evacuation which can be periodically updated and published, and which all building users can have confidence in; \n\n6.\tProvide suitable access and equipment for firefighting which is appropriate for the size and use of the development. \nB. All major development proposals should be submitted with a Fire Statement, which is an independent fire strategy, produced by a third party, suitably qualified assessor. The statement should detail how the development proposals will function in terms of: \n1.\tThe building's construction: methods, products and materials used, including manufacturers' details; \n\n2.\tThe means of escape for all buildings users: suitably designed stair cores, escape for building users who are disabled or require level access, and associated evacuation strategy approach; \n\n3.\tFeatures which reduce the risk to life: fire alarm systems, passive and active fire safety measures and associated management and maintenance plans; \n\n4.\tAccess for fire service personnel and equipment: how this will be achieved in an evacuation situation, water supplies, provision and positioning and equipment, firefighting lifts, stairs and lobbies, any fire suppression and smoke ventilation systems proposed, and the ongoing maintenance and monitoring of these; \n\n5.\tHow provision will be made within the curtilage of the site to enable fire appliances to gain access to the building; \n\n6.\tEnsuring that any potential future modifications to the building will take into account and not compromise the base build fire safety/protection measures. \n4.3\tA Fire Statement, as prepared by Delta Fire Engineering (dated 20 July 2023), has been submitted in support of the current application. The Statement clearly outlines how each section of policy D12 of the London Plan (2021) has been considered and complied with.\n4.4\tFor the purposes of Policy D12 of the London Plan (2021), the submitted Fire Statement is considered to be acceptable. As the design of the development progresses through the detailed stage, a detailed fire strategy will be produced for inclusion at the building regulations stage. \n4.5\tUpon full assessment of the submitted material supporting the application, taking into account all material considerations, it is considered the objectives of relevant policies cited in the reason for the condition have been met.\n5.\tRECOMMENDATION\n5.1\tGrant permission and discharge the condition."
