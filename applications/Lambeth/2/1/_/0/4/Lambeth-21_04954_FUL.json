Unless it complies with the standards set out in the SPG, no NRMM shall be on site, at any time, whether in use or not, without the prior written consent of the local planning authority. The developer must register all NRMM at https://nrmm.london/user-nrmm/register prior to bringing it on to site and shall keep the register up to date by listing all NRMM used during the demolition, site preparation and construction phases of the development.\r\rReason: To ensure that air quality is not adversely affected by the development (Policy SI 1 of the London Plan 2021).",
