    "The proposed dwelling mix (9 x 3-bedrom 6-person units) would fail to respond to local evidence of need, fail to deliver a range of unit types at different price points and would therefore fail to contribute towards a mixed and balanced community, contrary to Policy H10 of the London Plan (2021) and Policy H4 of the Lambeth Local Plan 2020-2035 (September 2021).",
    "The proposed residential units, as a result of their siting and design, would fail to provide acceptable standards of privacy for future occupiers and would fail to avoid unacceptable levels of overlooking and perceived overlooking, contrary to Policy Q2 of the Lambeth Local Plan 2020-2035 (September 2021).",
    "The proposed development, as a result of its access and design, would result in an unacceptable loss of privacy to habitable rooms within the property at 157 Auckland Hill, contrary to Policy Q2 of the Lambeth Local Plan 2020-2035 (September 2021).",
    "The proposed development, as a result of the removal of existing on street parking spaces, would lead to an unacceptable increase in parking stress within the vicinity of the site, contrary to Policy T1 of the Lambeth Local Plan 2020-2035 (September 2021).   In addition, the applicant has failed to demonstrate that the proposal could provide safe access to residents, visitors, emergency vehicles, refuse vehicles and other delivery vehicles. The proposed therefore fails to make adequate provision for servicing, country to Policy T7 of the LLP and would fail to be designed accordance with the Mayor's Healthy Streets Approach (which seeks to improve street safety, comfort, convenience and amenity in order to encourage more sustainable means of transport) and Vision Zero which seeks to design street systems to reduce danger, contrary to Policy T2 of the LLP.",
    "The proposed development is contrary to the development plan when looked at as a whole on account of the non-compliances with development plan policy identified in reasons 1 to 5 and there are not considered to be material considerations of sufficient weight to mean that planning permission should be granted contrary to the development plan."
