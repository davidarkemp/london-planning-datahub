  "description": "We would like to remove the lime tree due to proximity to the boundary wall, which gives us concern not only for the stability of the wall that protects our property from Slade Gardens, but also due to the difficulty (if not impossibility) of constant care to remove the new growth on the lower trunk. In addition,  the congestion above due to two other limes on either side of the side and boundary walls requires us to constantly keep the tree severely pruned. The area is already well shaded in that corner of our property and adjoining properties. We would like to replace the rear area with three apple trees to form part of an edible garden area we are creating at the rear of our garden.",
