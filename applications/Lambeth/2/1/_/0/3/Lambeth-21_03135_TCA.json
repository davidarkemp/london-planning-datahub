  "description": "We wish to fell a mature but non native Cordyline Australia tree which is in the middle of the garden and replace it with trees positioned around the border so as to provide us with privacy whilst in the garden. This is particularly relevant in relation to the border with No 21 Macaulay Road where a recent new extension with a roof terrace has led to significant overlooking of our property and the replacement trees (2 x Amelanchier Robin Hill, 1x Cornus Milky Way and 1 x Sorbus Aucutaria ) will be used with other shrubs to provide us with different heights of screening.  The new trees will also help to replace cover provided by a mature Silver Birch tree that was felled in the garden of No 21.",
