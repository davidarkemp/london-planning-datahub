  "description": "No TPO applies\r\rOne Leylandii tree as identified on the sketch. This has apparently been previously coppiced or cut back and now growing as numerous poles to a great height and density. It is unsightly and disproportionate to the garden, dominating the garden and blocking light into the garden and also into the garden of 64 such that the occupants are also keen to remove this tree. We are planning removal of this tree. \r\rThere are other large trees along the rear boundary and before considering any replacement tree we would plan to see how the light is after the felling of the Leylandii\r\rThe very overgrown bay tree at the boundary between 66 and 64 is similarly dominating and blocking light to both gardens. We propose to cut this back.",
