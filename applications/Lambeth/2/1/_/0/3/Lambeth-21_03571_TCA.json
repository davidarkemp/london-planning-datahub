  "description": "URGENT TREE REMOVAL\rYEW 2. Remove the heavily leaning yew tree marked \"Yew 2\" in the attached Plan of the back garden. This tree has moved significantly in the past 12-18 months and could fall on the tree  in front (Yew 1) which could also fall and cause damage to our property and that next door. See photo 1. We plan to plant another Yew tree or similar evergreen species in a position slightly behind where the stump will remain (see X on plan)\r\rURGENT TREE MAINTENANCE \rROBINA. Remove the low hanging branches of the Robina, the weight of which are pulling this tree down. This tree is propped but if the lower branches are not removed this could fall on the shed. (see photo 3). Reducing the weight of the lower branches should reduce the risk of this tree leaning further.\rEUCALYTPTUS. Thin the crown of the Gum Tree / Eucalyptus (see photo 3). This is maintenance which is needed now, but has also been requested by the insurance company of No. 51 Lancaster Avenue in respect of subsidence to the back of their house. The roots of this Eucalyptus have not been identified as causing a problem but reducing the tree has been recommended.",
