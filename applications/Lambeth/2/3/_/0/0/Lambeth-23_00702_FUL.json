    "All new external work and finishes and work of making good shall match the original work in respect of the materials, colour, texture, profile and finished. appearance, except where indicated otherwise on the drawings hereby approved or unless otherwise required by condition.  \n \nReason: To preserve the character and appearance of the local area. (Policies Q5, Q8 and Q11 of the Lambeth Local Plan (2021)).",
    "Prior to the occupation of the development hereby permitted, the windows at first floor flank elevations shall be fixed shut, fitted with obscure glazing film at a height of 1.7m above floor level, and shall be retained as such for the duration of the development.\n\nReason:  To protect the amenities of adjoining occupiers (policy Q2 of the London Borough of Lambeth Local Plan (2021).",
    "Prior to the use of the proposed extended floorspace, and residential unit details of waste and recycling for the development shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority. The waste and recycling shall be provided in accordance with the approved details. The waste and recycling must comply with the Lambeth's Refuse & Recycling Storage Design Guide (2013), unless it is demonstrated in the submissions that such provision is inappropriate for this specific development.\n\nReason: to encourage the sustainable management of waste and to safeguard the visual amenities of the area (Policies Q2 and Q12 of the London Borough of Lambeth Local Plan (2021)).",
    "6  Prior to the occupation of the development hereby permitted a Method of Construction Statement shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority and shall include details regarding: \na) The notification of neighbours with regard to specific works and a named contact point. b) Advance notification of road closures;\n c) Details regarding parking, deliveries, and storage. Page 2 of 6\n d) Details regarding dust mitigation. \ne) Details of measures to prevent the deposit of mud and debris on the public highway. \nf) Details of coordination with surrounding developments and their construction timelines. \ng) Details of measures to protect the street trees during the demolition and construction periods\n h) Details of delivery times, with strategies to minimise disruption to the local road network particularly during peak hours and avoid conflicts with pedestrians and traffic at the beginning and end of the school day; and\n i) Any other measures to mitigate the impact of demolition and construction upon the amenity of the area and the function and safety of the highway network.\nNo development shall commence until provision has been made to accommodate all site operatives', visitors' and construction vehicles loading, offloading, parking and turning within the site or otherwise during the construction period in accordance with the approved details. The development shall thereafter be carried out in accordance with the details and measures approved in the Method of Construction Statement. \n\nReason: Development must not commence before this condition is discharged to avoid hazard and obstruction being caused to users of the public highway and to safeguard residential amenity from the start of the construction process (Policies SI 1 of the London Plan (2021); Policy T7 of the Lambeth Local Plan 2020-2035 (Adopted September 2021)",
    "Prior to the commencement of the development hereby permitted, a Sustainability Statement including an Energy Strategy shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority.

    "If Non-Road Mobile Machinery (NRMM) of net power of 37kW and up to and including 560kW is required on site during the course of demolition, site preparation and construction phases, it must comply with the emission standards set out in chapter 7 of the GLA's supplementary planning guidance \"Control of Dust and Emissions During Construction and Demolition\" dated July 2014 (SPG), or subsequent guidance. Unless it complies with the standards set out in the SPG, no NRMM shall be on site, at any time, whether in use or not, without the prior written consent of the local planning authority. The developer must register all NRMM at https://nrmm.london/user-nrmm/register prior to bringing it on to site and shall keep the register up to date by listing all NRMM used during the demolition, site preparation and construction phases of the development. \n\nReason: To ensure that air quality is not adversely affected by the development (Policy SI1 of the London Plan 2021).",
    "Prior to the construction of the relevant part of the works, evidence should be submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority which shows that water saving measures have been considered/proposed (including wastewater heat recovery, water metering, greywater and rainwater recycling). The development shall thereafter be implemented in full in accordance with the approved details before the use hereby permitted commences. \n\n\nReason: To ensure that the development has an acceptable level of sustainability (Policy EN4 of the Lambeth Local Plan (2021), and Policy SI5 of the London Plan (2021))."
