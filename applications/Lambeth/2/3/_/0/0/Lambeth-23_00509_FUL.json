    "The proposed two-storey rear infill extension by reason of its excessive scale, massing, bulk, and materials results in an incongruous and overly dominant addition that fails to respond positively to the original architecture of the host building, dominating the rear elevation and undermining the rear return. Furthermore, the existing elevation plans have been illustrated incorrectly and officers are not able to assess whether the development includes the replacement of the front elevation windows. The proposal results in less than substantial harm to the character and appearance of the Poet's Corner Conservation Area and delivers no public benefits to outweigh the harm identified. As such, the proposal would be contrary to Policies Q2, Q5, Q8, Q11 and Q22 of the Lambeth Local Plan 2020-2035 (2021), the National Planning Policy Framework (2021) and the Building Alterations and Extensions SPD (2015)."
