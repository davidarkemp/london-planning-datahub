    "By virtue of the increase in scale and subsequent massing of built form to the side and rear of the property as a result of the proposed first-floor wrap around extension, the resultant development would appear as a discordant addition which would adversely compromise the existing relationship shared between the existing single storey side extension and the host property; and would unbalance the symmetry shared between the pair of semi-detached properties. The impact of the proposed first-floor extension on the host property would be further exacerbated by the change in roof pitch and the scale and design of the proposed windows which would fail to relate to the portrait windows which feature across the host property at upper floor level. As such, the proposed first-floor side extension would have an unacceptable impact on the character and appearance of the host property, contrary to Policy Q11 of the Lambeth Local Plan (2021) and the guidance as contained within the Council's Building alterations and extensions SPD (2015)."
