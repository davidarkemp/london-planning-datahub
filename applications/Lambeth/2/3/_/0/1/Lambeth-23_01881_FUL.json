    "By reason of the proposed development providing single-aspect accommodation, combined with the proposed openings and external amenity space being materially overlooked by windows to the southern elevation of the adjacent 5-6 storey Leno House, the proposed development would fail to provide high-quality accommodation. Furthermore, in the absence of a Noise and Odour assessment having been submitted, it has failed to be demonstrated that the proposed development would be free from undue noise and odour. As such, the proposed development would be contrary to Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021) and Policies Q2 and H5 of the Lambeth Local Plan 2020-2035 (2021).",
    "By reason of the pitched roof form design and full width scale of the proposed extension, the proposed development would appear as an incongruous rearwards enlargement to the row of terraced properties to the detriment of the character and appearance of the row of terraced properties, the contribution the existing building makes to the architectural integrity of these properties, and less than substantial harm to the significance of the Loughborough Park Conservation Area. The identified harm would not be outweighed by any public benefits of the scheme. The proposed development would, therefore, conflict with Policies Q2, Q5, Q11 and Q22 of the Lambeth Local Plan 2020-2035 (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "In the absence of a Daylight and Sunlight report having been submitted in support of the proposed development, it has failed to be demonstrated that the proposed development would have an acceptable impact on the levels of light neighbouring properties within 328 and 330 Coldharbour Lane and the proposed development receive. The proposed development would, therefore, conflict with Policy Q2 of the Lambeth Local Plan 2020-2035 (2021).",
    "By reason of inappropriate cycle storage having been provided it has, therefore, failed to be demonstrated that the proposed development would be provided with adequate accessible cycle storage which is of a design that would meet the needs of future occupiers and encourage the use of sustainable transport. The application, therefore, fails to comply with Policy T5 of the London Plan (2021) and Policies T1, T3 and Q13 of the Lambeth Local Plan 2020-2035 (2021).",
    "In the absence of a Unilateral Undertaking or a Section 106 Agreement securing appropriate mitigation by restricting future occupiers of the development from obtaining parking permits within the Controlled Parking Zone, and providing Car Club and Cycle Hire membership, the proposed development would likely exacerbate existing parking stress and congestion on the surrounding highway network. The application is, therefore, contrary to Policies T4, T5 and T6 of the London Plan (2021) and Policies T1, T3 and T6 of the Lambeth Local Plan 2020-2035 (2021)."
