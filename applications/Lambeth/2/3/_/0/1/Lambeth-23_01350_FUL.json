    "The proposed three-storey residential unit by virtue of its layout, area, excessive size and design would result in a deficiency in sunlight exposure into the primary sitting/tv living room located at the basement level for future occupiers. The sitting/tv and bedroom rooms located at basement level would have restricted outlook towards tall and narrow lightwells. The proposal would result in substandard accommodation to the detriment of future occupiers contrary to Policies H5 and Q27 of the Lambeth Local Plan 2020-2035 (2021).",
    "The proposed three-storey residential unit by virtue of its excessive scale, area, bulk and massing, materials and design would result in an overly dominant and incongruous development that fails to appear subordinate in relation with its adjoining and neighbouring properties. The use of titanium cladding on the south side elevation of the dwelling is inappropriate material that has a harmful impact on the distinctiveness of the locality. Furthermore, the elongated rooflights and roofing materials disrupt the unified character and appearance of the terrace group and would conflict will the prevailing characteristics of the locality. In addition, it has not been demonstrated that the solar panels would be appropriately screened and not readily visible from the street. The proposal would be contrary to Policy Q2, Q5, Q6, Q7, Q8, Q11 and Q14 of the Lambeth Local Plan 2020-2035 (2021).",
    "By failing to illustrate the location of the air source heat pump on the drawings, officers are not able to fully assess this aspect of the development to determine that the equipment would not cause harm to the character and appearance of the new building and terrace group. The proposal would be contrary to Policies Q2, Q5, Q8 and Q11 of the Lambeth Local Plan 2020-2035 (2021) and the Building Alterations and Extensions SPD (2015).",
    "The proposed dwelling by virtue of its excessive scale, layout, design, bulk and massing would have an adverse impact on residential amenity in terms of privacy and overlooking for the occupants at nos. 8, 7, 9, and 11 Turret Grove and no. 8 Rozel Road and would result in a sense of enclosure to the occupiers of nos. 9 and 11 Turret Grove. The proposal would be contrary to Policy Q2 of the Lambeth Local Plan 2020-2035 (2021).",
    "In the absence of a noise report it has not been demonstrated that the proposed Air Source Heat Pumps would not have adverse impact on noise from sensitive receptors located on Rozel Road and Turret Grove. The proposal would be contrary to Policy Q2 of the Lambeth Local Plan 2020-2035 (2021).",
    "In the absence of a Fire Statement, it has not been demonstrated that the layout of the development would minimise the risk of injury and fire for the future occupiers of the development. The proposal would be contrary to Policy D12 of the London Plan 2020-2035 (2021).",
    "In the absence of a Unilateral Undertaking or other legal agreement securing appropriate mitigation by restricting future occupiers of the development from restricting car parking permits and obtaining car club memberships and cycle hire memberships, the proposed development would not promote sustainable modes of travel and reduce congestion on the surrounding highway network. The application is therefore contrary to Policies D4, T3 and T7 of the Lambeth Local Plan 2020-2035 (2021) and Policy T6 of the London Plan (2021)."
