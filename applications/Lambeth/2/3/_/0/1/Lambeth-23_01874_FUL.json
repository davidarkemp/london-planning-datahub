    "The proposal would provide substandard residential accommodation which would be to the detriment of the amenities of future occupiers. This is due to, the overall size of Flats 2 and 3 failing to meet the standards in the Nationally Described Space Standards, the proposed ceiling height for Flat 3 and a lack of outdoor amenity space or additional compensatory internal living space . The application is therefore contrary to Policies H5 and Q2 of the Lambeth Local Plan (2021) and Policy D6 London Plan (2021).",
    "Flat 1 by reason of the position of the cycle storage in such close proximity of the habitable bedroom window would fail to provide an acceptable standard of accommodation for future occupiers due to the impact on privacy and noise. The application is therefore contrary to Policies H5 and Q2 of the Lambeth Local Plan (2021) and Policy D6 London Plan (2021).",
    "The proposed cycle stores are considered to be of an unpractical location, layout and design, they would not be easily accessible and would not be appropriately secure. The application is therefore contrary to Policy T5 of the London Plan (2021) and Policy Q13 of the Lambeth Local Plan (2021).",
    "The proposed rear mansard roof extension by reason of its detailed design, scale and massing would be a dominant and incongruous addition. The proposed mansard does not respond positively to the host building or terrace row and significantly harms the character and appearance of the host building and terrace row. The proposal is contrary to Policies Q2, Q5, Q8 and Q11 of the Local Plan 2021 and the Building Alterations and Extensions SPD 2015.",
    "In the absence of a completed S106 agreement securing appropriate mitigation by restricting future occupiers of the development from obtaining parking permits within the Controlled Parking Zone, providing car club membership and providing cycle hire membership, the proposed development would likely exacerbate existing parking stress and congestion on the surrounding highway network and would fail to encourage sustainable modes of transport. The proposal is therefore contrary to policies D4, T1 and T6 of the Lambeth Local Plan (2021) and Policy T6 of the London Plan (2021)."
