  "description": "T1: x1 Cherry. Suggested works - Crown Reduction, reducing the height and spread of the tree by up to 2 metres. Reason - medium tree growing on top of the retaining wall actually in number 140 but overhanging both gardens getting close to the houses and obviously with potential for a great deal more growth. \r\rSH1: Mixed shrubs and bushes. Suggested works - cut down shrubs within 3-4 metres of the retaining wall to ground level. Reason - the mixture of elder, nettles, brambles etc is overhanging and dominating the small garden under the retaining wall.",
