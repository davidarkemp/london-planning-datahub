    "By reason of the proposed openings to the south elevation at first floor level of the proposed dwelling and the proximity with neighbouring openings to the rear of 324, 326 and 328 Coldharbour Lane, the proposed openings would be susceptible to material levels of in-looking to the detriment of the amenity future occupiers of the proposed dwelling should reasonably expect to enjoy. In the absence of a Noise assessment having been submitted, it has also failed to be demonstrated that the proposed openings and the rooms they serve internally would be free from undue noise and disturbance from the adjacent existing plant. The proposed dwelling would, therefore, fail to provide high quality accommodation, contrary to Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021) and Policy H5 of the Lambeth Local Plan 2020-2035 (2021).",
    "By reason of the proposed openings to the south elevation at first floor level of the proposed dwelling and the proximity with neighbouring openings to the rear of 326 Coldharbour Lane, the proposed development would materially compromise the level of privacy occupiers of this neighbouring property currently enjoy. The proposed development would, therefore, conflict with Policy Q2 of the Lambeth Local Plan 2020-2035 (2021).",
    "In the absence of a Daylight and Sunlight Assessment having been submitted in support of the proposed development, insufficient information has been provided to demonstrate that the proposed residential unit and surrounding properties and uses would receive acceptable levels of Daylight and Sunlight. The proposed development would, therefore, be contrary to Policy Q2 of the Lambeth Local Plan 2020-2035 (2021).",
    "By reason of inappropriate cycle storage having been provided it has, therefore, failed to be demonstrated that the proposed development would be provided with adequate accessible cycle storage which is of a design that would meet the needs of future occupiers and encourage the use of sustainable transport. The application, therefore, fails to comply with Policy T5 of the London Plan (2021) and Policies T1, T3 and Q13 of the Lambeth Local Plan 2020-2035 (2021).",
    "In the absence of a Unilateral Undertaking or a Section 106 Agreement securing appropriate mitigation by restricting future occupiers of the development from obtaining parking permits within the Controlled Parking Zone, and providing Car Club and Cycle Hire membership, the proposed development would likely exacerbate existing parking stress and congestion on the surrounding highway network. The application is, therefore, contrary to Policies T4, T5 and T6 of the London Plan (2021) and Policies T1, T3 and T6 of the Lambeth Local Plan 2020-2035 (2021)."
