    "By reason of the proposed residential unit failing to meet the minimum internal floorspace and floor to ceiling height standards as described by the Nationally Described Space Standards, failing to provide dual-aspect accommodation and failing to be served by any form of external amenity space or appropriate additional internal living accommodation, the units would fail to provide high quality living accommodation. Furthermore, owing to the proposed additional unit failing to provide an internal floorspace complaint with the minimum internal space standards, the scope for internal adaptations for the ambulant disabled would be limited. As such, the proposed development would conflict with Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021) and Policies H5 and Q1 of the Lambeth Local Plan 2020-2035 (2021).",
    "In the absence of a Daylight and Sunlight Assessment having been submitted in support of the proposed development, insufficient information has been provided to demonstrate that the proposed residential unit and surrounding properties and uses would receive acceptable levels of Daylight and Sunlight. The proposed development would, therefore, be contrary to Policy Q2 of the Lambeth Local Plan 2020-2035 (2021).",
    "Insufficient information has been submitted in relation to the provision of cycle storage. It has, therefore, failed to be demonstrated that the proposed development would be provided with adequate accessible cycle storage which is of a design that would meet the needs of future occupiers and encourage the use of sustainable transport. The application, therefore, fails to comply with Policy T5 of the London Plan (2021) and Policies T1, T3 and Q13 of the Lambeth Local Plan 2020-2035 (2021).",
    "In the absence of a Fire Safety Statement, the applicant has failed to demonstrate compliance with Policy D12 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "In the absence of a Unilateral Undertaking or a Section 106 Agreement securing appropriate mitigation by restricting future occupiers of the development from obtaining parking permits within the Controlled Parking Zone, and providing Car Club and Cycle Hire membership, the proposed development would likely exacerbate existing parking stress and congestion on the surrounding highway network. The application is, therefore, contrary to Policies T4, T5 and T6 of the London Plan (2021) and Policies D4, T1, T3 and T6 of the Lambeth Local Plan 2020-2035 (2021)."
