    "The replacement of all existing timber windows and doors with timber windows and doors, by reason that the submitted drawings fail to replicate the existing windows dimensions and are unsympathetic change, would neither preserve nor enhance the character or appearance of the host building or conservation area. The proposed window detail results in a low degree of less than substantial harm with no public or heritage benefits. The proposed development would thus conflict with policy Q5, Q11 and Q22 of the Lambeth Local Plan 2020 - 2035 (2021) as well as paragraphs 200 and 202 of the National Planning Policy Framework"
