    "The proposals by reason of their unsympathetic design, proportions, scale and massing would introduce an incongruous, over-dominant an alien-built form that would fail to respect the character and appearance of the host building, the surrounding terrace and wider South Lambeth Road Conservation Area and would result in less than substantial harm which would not be off-set by any public benefit.  As such the proposals are contrary to policies Q5, Q11, Q22, Q23 and Q27 of the Lambeth Local Plan 2020-2035 (2021) and paragraph 202 of the NPPF (2023).",
    "The proposed development would have unacceptable impacts on residential amenity in terms of sunlight/daylight and sense of enclosure, especially in regards to occupiers of No 314 South Lambeth Road.  As such the proposals are contrary to the objectives of policy Q2 of the Lambeth Local Plan 2020-2035 (2021)."
