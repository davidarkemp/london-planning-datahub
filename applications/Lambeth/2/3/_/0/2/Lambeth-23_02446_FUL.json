    "The proposed Flat 3 fails to have a floor to ceiling height of 2.5m over at least 75 percent of the internal floor area. The proposed Flat 2 fails to meet the minimum internal floor space standards and in-built storage requirements as set out in the Nationally Described Space Standards resulting in substandard residential accommodation which would be to the detriment of the amenities of future occupiers. This is further exacerbated by the lack of any outdoor amenity space or additional compensatory internal living space for Flat 2. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies H5 and Q2 of the Lambeth Local Plan 2020-2035 (2021) and Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "The proposed L-shaped single storey rear extension by reason of its excessive layout, design, scale, massing and the loss of the rhythm of the 'infill' area, would result in an overly bulky and dominant addition to the host building that fails to preserve or enhance the character and appearance of the host building, wider terrace and the Ferndale Road Conservation Area. The development would result in a low degree of less than substantial harm to the character and appearance of the Ferndale Road Conservation Area and delivers no public benefits to outweigh the harm identified. The proposal would be contrary to Policies Q2, Q5, Q8, Q11 and Q22 of the Lambeth Local Plan 2020-2035 (2021), the National Planning Policy Framework (2023) and the Lambeth Design Guide SPD (2023).",
    "The proposed link dormer roof extension by reason of its excessive scale, massing and design would result in an overly dominant and an incongruous development which fails to be subordinate to the host building. The development would result in a low degree of less than substantial harm to the character and appearance of the Ferndale Road Conservation Area and delivers no public benefits to outweigh the harm identified. The proposal would be contrary to Policies Q2, Q5, Q8, Q11 and Q22 of the Lambeth Local Plan 2020-2035 (2021), the National Planning Policy Framework (2023) and the Lambeth Design Guide SPD (2023).",
    "The proposed L-shaped single storey rear extension by reason of its siting, excessive layout, scale, bulk and form would result in a sense of enclosure and loss of outlook for the occupiers of nos. 44 and 48 Ferndale Road. The proposal would be contrary to Policy Q2 of the Lambeth Local Plan 2020-2035 (2021).",
    "The location of the proposed cycle storage and refuse storage in the front garden by reasons of their layout, lack of screening and soft landscaping, would create a cluttered appearance at the front elevation of the host property and adversely harm the visual amenity of the public realm. The cycle store and refuse store as designed would fail to preserve or enhance the character and appearance of the host property and results in a low degree of less than substantial harm to the character and appearance of the Ferndale Road Conservation Area which is not outweighed by any public benefits. The proposal would be contrary to Policies Q2, Q5, Q8, Q11, Q12, Q13 and Q22 of the Lambeth Local Plan 2020-2035 (2021), the National Planning Policy Framework (2023) and the Lambeth Design Guide SPD (2023).",
    "The proposed cycle storage due to its vertical nature, fails to provide accessible cycle parking to users. In the absence of detailed plans to demonstrate that the provision of suitable, covered and secure cycle parking is able to be provided at the site, the proposal would be contrary to Policy Q13 and T3 of the Lambeth Local Plan 2020-2035 (2021) and Policy T5 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate how the proposals would achieve inclusive design (wheelchair accessibility/adaptability). The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policy Q1 of the Lambeth Local Plan (2021) and Policy D5 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "In the absence of a Unilateral Undertaking or other legal agreement securing appropriate mitigation by restricting future occupiers of the development from obtaining parking permits within the Controlled Parking Zone, providing car club membership and cycle hire scheme, the proposed development would likely exacerbate existing parking stress and congestion on the surrounding highway network. The application is therefore contrary to Policies D4, T1 and T7 of the Lambeth Local Plan 2020-2035 (2021) and Policy T6 of the London Plan (2021)."
