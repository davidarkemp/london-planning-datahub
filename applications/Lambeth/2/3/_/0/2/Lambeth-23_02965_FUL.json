    "By virtue of the increase in height of the main ridge and the failure to comply with the guidance for L-shaped dormers as contained within paragraph 4.103 of the Lambeth Design Guide Part 4 SPD (2023), the proposal would result in a dominant and discordant enlargement to the detriment of the character and appearance of the existing building and wider street scene. The proposed development is therefore considered to be in conflict with Policies Q2, Q5 and Q11 of the Lambeth Local Plan 2020-2035 (2021) and the Lambeth Design Guide SPD (2023).",
    "The proposed rear L-shaped dormer extension would result in a loss of outlook to the detriment of the occupiers of the second floor of No.159 Milkwood Road. This is considered unacceptable and as a result is contrary to Policy Q2 of the Lambeth Local Plan 2020-2035 (2021).",
    "In the absence of a daylight and sunlight assessment, insufficient information has been provided to demonstrate to the local planning authority, that the proposed L-shaped rear dormer extension would not materially compromise the levels of light received by the second floor opening to the rear of No.159 Milkwood Road to the detriment of the occupiers. As such, the proposal is in conflict with Policy Q2 of the Lambeth Local Plan 2020-2035 (2021)."
