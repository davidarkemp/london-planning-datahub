    "Due to Flats 2, 3 and 4 failing to meet the minimum internal floor space standards set out in the Nationally Described Space Standards, the proposal would provide substandard residential accommodation which would be to the detriment of the amenities of future occupiers. This is further exacerbated by the  lack of any outdoor amenity space or additional compensatory internal living space for Flats 2, 3 and 4 and the shortfall in the required external outdoor space for Flat 1. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies H5 and Q2 of the Lambeth Local Plan 2020-2035 (2021) and Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "The proposed L-shaped single storey rear extension by reason of its excessive layout, design, scale and massing would result in an overly bulky and dominant addition to the host building that fails to achieve subordination and preserve or enhance the character and appearance of the host building, wider terrace and the Minet Estate Conservation Area. The development would result in a low degree of less than substantial harm to the character and appearance of the Minet Estate Conservation Area which is not outweighed by any public benefits. . The proposal would be contrary to Policies Q2, Q5, Q8, Q11 and Q22 of the Lambeth Local Plan 2020-2035 (2021), the National Planning Policy Framework (2021) and the Lambeth Design Guide SPD (2023).",
    "The proposed roof extension over the existing two-storey addition by reason of its design, mass and scale would result in unacceptable bulk addition that appears incongruous and overwhelms rather than achieves subordination in context with the host building. The proposal would not preserve or enhance the character and appearance of the host building and instead causes a low level of less than substantial harm to the character and appearance of the Minet Estate Conservation Area which is not outweighed by any public benefits. The proposal would be contrary to Policies Q2, Q5, Q8, Q11 and Q22 of the Lambeth Local Plan 2020-2035 (2021), the National Planning Policy Framework (2021) and the Lambeth Design Guide SPD (2023).",
    "The installation of a proposed side ground floor window by reasons of its style, proportion, and dimensions would appear awkward and jar the historic fenestration arrangement facing Lilford Road. The proposal would not preserve or enhance the character and appearance of the host building and instead causes a low level of less than substantial harm to the character and appearance of the Minet Estate Conservation Area which is not outweighed by any public benefits. The proposal would be contrary to Policies Q2, Q5, Q8, Q11 and Q22 of the Lambeth Local Plan 2020-2035 (2021), the National Planning Policy Framework (2021) and the Lambeth Design Guide SPD (2023).",
    "The location of the proposed cycle and refuse storage in the front garden by reasons of its layout lack of screening and soft landscaping, would create a cluttered appearance at the front elevation of the host property and adversely harm the visual amenity of the public realm at the junction of Paulet Road and Lilford Road. The cycle and refuse store as designed would fail to preserve or enhance the character and appearance of the host property and causes a less than substantial harm to the character and appearance of the Minet Estate Conservation Area which is not outweighed by any public benefits.  The proposal would be contrary to Policies Q2, Q5, Q8, Q11, Q12, Q13 and Q22 of the Lambeth Local Plan 2020-2035 (2021), the National Planning Policy Framework (2021) and the Lambeth Design Guide SPD (2023).",
    "The proposed wrap-around extension by reason of its excessive height of 3.39m would have an adverse impact on residential amenity for the occupants of no. 3 Paulet Road in terms of daylight/sunlight, outlook and sense of enclosure which is contrary to Policy Q2 of the Lambeth Local Plan 2021.",
    "In the absence of an arboricultural report, it has not been demonstrated that the removal of valued trees would not have an adverse impact on the visual amenity of the public realm and that measures to protect retained trees adjacent and on-site during construction and that adequate replacement planting has been considered from the outset of the development. The proposal would be contrary to Policies Q2 and Q10 of the Lambeth Local Plan 2021.",
    "In the absence of detailed plans of the provision for cycle parking, particularly those located in the front garden of the site it has not been demonstrated that the total number of long and short stay cycle spaces would be conveniently located in a safe and covered store for the future occupants and visitors; and that the facilities in the front garden would be appropriately screened. The proposal would be contrary to Policy Q13 and T3 of the Lambeth Local Plan 2020-2035 (2021) and Policy T5 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "In the absence of detailed plans of the provision for separate refuse and recycling storage, it has not been demonstrated that the bins store would be constructed from robust materials, attractively designed, and avoid harm to the visual amenity of the locality. The proposal would be contrary to Policy Q12 of the Lambeth Local Plan 2020-2035 (2021), the Waste & Recycling Storage and Collection Requirements Technical Specification for Architects & Designers (2023) and the Refuse and Recycling Storage Design Guide (2022).",
    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate how the proposals would achieve inclusive design (wheelchair access/adaptability). The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policy Q1 of the Lambeth Local Plan 2020-2035 (2021) and Policy D5 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "In the absence of a Unilateral Undertaking or other legal agreement securing appropriate mitigation by restricting future occupiers of the development from obtaining parking permits within the Controlled Parking Zone, providing car club membership and cycle hire scheme, the proposed development would likely exacerbate existing parking stress and congestion on the surrounding highway network. The application is therefore contrary to Policies D4, T1 and T7 of the Lambeth Local Plan 2020-2035 (2021) and Policy T6 of the London Plan (2021)."
