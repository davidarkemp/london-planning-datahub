    "The proposed 2x 2bedroom self-contained units would fail to offer a mix of housing types that include a family-sized accommodation to meet the current and future needs of future occupants in the borough contrary to Policies H4 and H6 of the Lambeth Local Plan 2020-2035 (2021).",
    "The proposed rear garden amenity space for Flat B is unacceptable as occupiers are unable to safely access this area within the red line boundary of the application site. Furthermore, the proposed terrace for Flat B falls below the 10sq.m required for a flatted development. This is further exacerbated by the lack of additional compensatory internal living space for Flat B. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies H5, H6 and Q3 of the Lambeth Local Plan 2020-2035 (2021) and Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "In the absence of a fully compliant 'BRE' report it has not been demonstrated that Flat A would receive adequate daylight/sunlight for the future occupants, particularly to the habitable rooms at lower ground level. The proposal would be contrary to Policies Q2, H5 and H6 of the Lambeth Local Plan 2020-2035 (2021) and Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "The proposed cycle storage for Flat B due to its vertical nature, fails to provide accessible cycle parking to users. In the absence of detailed plans to demonstrate that the provision of suitable, covered and secure cycle parking is able to be provided at the site, the proposal would be contrary to Policy Q13 and T3 of the Lambeth Local Plan 2020-2035 (2021) and Policy T5 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "The proposed refuse storage within the front lightwell at lower ground level would result in obstruction of the pavement due to the outward opening gates and would fail to be easily accessible requiring users to lower/lift heavy bins 1.78m in and out of the lightwell. Furthermore, due to the location of the bins adjacent the window of the lower ground floor bedroom of Flat A, the occupiers of this unit would be subject to noise, odour and restricted outlook contrary to Policies Q2, H5, H6, T2, T7 and Q12 of the Lambeth Local Plan 2020-2035 (2021) and Policy D6 and D14 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "In the absence of a Unilateral Undertaking or other legal agreement securing appropriate mitigation by restricting future occupiers of the development from obtaining parking permits within the Controlled Parking Zone and providing car club membership and cycle hire scheme, the proposed development would likely exacerbate existing parking stress and congestion on the surrounding highway network. The application is therefore contrary to Policies D4, T1 and T7 of the Lambeth Local Plan 2020-2035 (2021) and Policy T6 of the London Plan 2021."
