Tree with longitudinal cavity running up western side of trunk from ground level up to 1.4m AGL.\r(consent had previously already been given for CR50% but this work was not implemented and this specification is for lesser works to deal with shading issues and canopy touching neighbours building)\r\rT2 & T3 Himalayan Birches - Fell to ground level, poison and remove stumps.\rTrees are young specimens, still with stakes on them, part of a garden feature no longer required the area small trees with DBH's 84mm and 92mm respectively.
