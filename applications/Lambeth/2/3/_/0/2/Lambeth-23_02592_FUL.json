The assessment of the acoustic impact and necessary mitigation shall be undertaken in accordance with BS 4142: 2014 (or subsequent superseding equivalent) and shall include suitable screening to protect both the first floor habitable rooms and the neighbouring gardens as well as and ensure suitable noise levels at the facade to the neighbouring church premises. Within 3 months of commencement of operation a post-installation noise assessment shall be carried out including suitable measurements to confirm compliance with the approved noise criteria and submitted to and approved in writing by the planning authority. The scheme shall be implemented in accordance with the approved details and attenuation measures, including suitable hours of operation and any necessary timing systems to ensure compliance with these operating hours and all measures shall be permanently retained and maintained in working order for the duration of the use and their operation.\r\rReason: To protect the amenities of adjoining occupiers and the surrounding area (policy Q2 of the London Borough of Lambeth Local Plan (2021)).\r",
