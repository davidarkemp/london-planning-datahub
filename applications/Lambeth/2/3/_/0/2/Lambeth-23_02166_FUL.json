    "The proposed roof extension by reason of its bulk, scale, and siting, would fail to respond to the character and appearance of the host property and surrounding terrace and would not constitute a subordinate addition to the host property.  As such the proposed extension is contrary to the guidance within the adopted SPD Lambeth Design Guide (Part 4) Building Alterations, Extensions and Retrofit (2023) and therefore fails to accord with the objectives of policies Q5 and Q11 of the Lambeth Local Plan (2021)."
