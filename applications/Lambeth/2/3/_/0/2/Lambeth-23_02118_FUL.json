  "decision_conditions": [
    "By reason of the proposed dwelling failing to be served by any form of external amenity space or appropriate additional internal living accommodation, failing to provide true dual-aspect accommodation free from undue levels of in-looking, and the internal living room failing to meet the BRE guidelines in terms of daylight, the proposed dwelling would fail to provide high quality living accommodation. The proposed development would, therefore, conflict with Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021) and Policies H5 and Q2 of the Lambeth Local Plan 2020 - 2035 (2021).",
    "By reason of the height, scale, massing, uncharacteristic proportions, form and detailing of the proposed dwelling, the proposed dwelling would appear as an incongruous form of development which would materially detract from the character and appearance of the area and would result in less than substantial harm to the significance of the Rush Common Brixton Hill Conservation Area. The identified harm would not be outweighed by any public benefits of the scheme and, therefore, the proposed development would conflict with Policy HC1 of the London Plan (2021), Policies Q5, Q8 and Q22 of the Lambeth Local Plan 2020 - 2035 (2021), and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "By reason of the further interruptions within the boundary along the northern side of Craster Road as a result of the proposed refuse store gates and the subsequent loss of solid brick walling which is characteristic of the immediate locality, the proposed development would adversely detract from the character and appearance of the area. The proposed development would, therefore, conflict with Policy Q2, Q5, Q15 and Q22 of the Lambeth Local Plan 2020 - 2035 (2021).",
    "By reason of the proposed rooflights to the northern and eastern pitched roof slopes and their positioning in relation to the internal finished floor level of the proposed dwelling, the proposed openings would provide opportunities to immediately overlook the rear curtilages of 92 and 94 Elm Park respectively. This relationship would be considered unneighbourly and would fail to safeguard neighbouring privacy, contrary to Policy Q2 of the Lambeth Local Plan 2020 - 2035 (2021).",
    "By reason of the submitted Daylight and Sunlight report failing to take into consideration the impact of the proposal on neighbouring windows to the front elevation of 29 Craster Road and to the rear 92 Elm Park and these neighbouring properties respective rear gardens ,and the rear garden of 94 Elm Park, insufficient information has been submitted to demonstrate that the proposed development would not materially overshadow these neighbouring properties. The proposed development would, therefore, be contrary to Policy Q2 of the Lambeth Local Plan 2020 - 2035 (2021).",
    "By reason of inappropriate cycle parking provision having been proposed, it has failed to be demonstrated that the proposed development would be provided with adequate, accessible cycle storge which would meet the needs of future occupiers and encourage the use of sustainable transport. The development, therefore, fails to comply with Policy T5 of the London Plan (2021) and Policies T1, T3 and Q13 of the Lambeth Local Plan 2020 - 2035 (2021).",
    "By reason of the proposed development failing to be served by waste and recycling storage which can be conditioned and enforceable, it has failed to be demonstrated that the proposed development would be provided with adequate waste and recycling storage, contrary to Policy Q12 of the Lambeth Local Plan 2020 - 2035 (2021).",
    "In the absence of a Fire Safety Statement, the applicant has failed to demonstrate compliance with Policy D12 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "In the absence of a Unilateral Undertaking or a Section 106 Agreement securing appropriate mitigation by restricting future occupiers of the development from obtaining parking permits within the Controlled Parking Zone, and providing Car Club and Cycle Hire membership, the proposed development would likely exacerbate existing parking stress and congestion on the surrounding highway network. The application is, therefore, contrary to Policies T4, T5 and T6 of the London Plan (2021) and Policies D4, T1, T3 and T6 of the Lambeth Local Plan 2020 - 2035 (2021)."
