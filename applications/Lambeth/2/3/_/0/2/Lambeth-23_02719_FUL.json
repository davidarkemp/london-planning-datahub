    "By reason of the increase in bulk, scale and massing at roof level to the existing building, the proposed development would appear overly dominant to the detriment of the architectural appearance and integrity of the group of terraced properties the application site forms part and would adversely challenge the subordinate relationship shared between the Kings Head Passage development and the adjacent street fronting locally listed public house King & Co. Subsequently, the proposed development would fail to preserve or enhance the significance of the locally listed building. The proposed development would, therefore, conflict with Policies Q5, Q11 and Q23 of the Lambeth Local Plan 2020 - 2035 (2021) and the NPPF (2023).",
    "In the absence of a Daylight and Sunlight report having been submitted demonstrating that the proposed development would not materially compromise the level of light neighbouring openings to the rear elevations of King & Co., 100 Clapham Park Road and residential development Mount Lodge would receive, the proposed development would conflict with Policy Q2 of the Lambeth Local Plan 2020-2035 (2021).",
    "By reason of the proximity of the proposed additional storey with the dormer windows to the rear (south-west) elevation of King & Co., 100 Clapham Park Road, the proposed development would materially compromise the outlook from these neighbouring openings to the detriment of the quality of accommodation of this neighbouring property, contrary to Policy Q2 of the Lambeth Local Plan 2020-2035 (2021)."
