    "The proposed residential conversion would unacceptably reduce the internal floorspace of the existing commercial unit from 57sq.m to 43.36sq.m and fails to improve the existing facilities due to the inability to provide sufficient space for cycle provision for staff and refuse and recycling storage. The proposal would compromise the viability and future use of the remaining commercial unit failing to support the vitality of the District Centre Primary Shopping Area of Clapham High Street which is contrary to Policy ED7 of the Lambeth Local Plan 2020-2035 (2021).",
    "The proposed residential conversion would fail to protect an existing family-sized dwelling that has an internal floorspace of 119.55sq.m, less than the required 130sq.m, to create three units contrary to Policy H6 of the Lambeth Local Plan 2020-2035 (2021).",
    "Proposed Flat 1 fails to have a floor to ceiling height with a minimum of 2.5m. Furthermore, the same unit is a single aspect which would not allow for natural cross ventilation to address London's unique heat island effect. In the absence of a fully compliant 'BRE' report it has not been demonstrated that Flat 1 would receive adequate levels of daylight and sunlight. In addition, the scheme would not provide any private outdoor amenity space for Flat 3, nor would this be provided through an uplift in internal floor area. The proposal would result in substandard quality of accommodation to the detriment of future occupiers which is contrary to Policies H5 and H6 of the Lambeth Local Plan 2020-2035 (2021) and Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "The proposed three storey rear extension by reasons of its excessive scale, mass and bulk would result in an overly dominant and incongruous addition that disrupts the uniform rear profile of the terrace row: nos. 6 to 10 The Pavement where two-storey rear returns are the norm. The development would overwhelm and fail to achieve subordination and preserve or enhance the character and appearance of the host building and the Clapham Conservation Area. The development would result in a low degree of less than substantial harm to the character and appearance of the Clapham Conservation Area which is not outweighed by any public benefits. The proposal would be contrary to Policies Q2, Q5, Q8, Q11 and Q22 of the Lambeth Local Plan 2020-2035 (2021), the National Planning Policy Framework (2023) and the Lambeth Design Guide (2023).",
    "The proposed mansard roof extension would result in the loss of a historic locally distinct hipped mansard roof that is repeated on the short terrace, further resulting in harm to the architectural integrity of the host building and the loss of a traditional roof form that responds positively to the Clapham Conservation Are The design of the proposed mansard would be an incongruous feature that unacceptably harms the uniform roofscape of the terrace and fails to appear subordinate to the host building and fails to preserve or enhance the character and appearance Clapham Conservation Area. The development would result in a low degree of less than substantial harm to the character and appearance of the Clapham Conservation Area which is not outweighed by any public benefits. The proposal would be contrary to Policies Q2, Q5, Q8, Q11 and Q22 of the Lambeth Local Plan 2020-2035 (2021), the National Planning Policy Framework (2023), and the Lambeth Design Guide (2023).",
    "Due to the location of the existing roof terraces and windows located on the side elevation of no. 5 The Pavement, occupiers of No. 5 The pavement would be able to comfortably look into the windows and amenity spaces of Flat 1 and Flat 2 of the proposal. Due to the loss of privacy and overlooking afforded to the future occupiers, the proposal would be contrary to Policies Q2, H5 and H6 of the Lambeth Local Plan 2020-2035 (2021).",
    "The proposed three storey rear extension and residential conversion by reason of its size would have an adverse impact on the living conditions of occupants at no. 5 The Pavement in terms of privacy and would have an overbearing visual impact to residents of no. 7 The Pavement; and the layout and scale of the development would potentially impact the ventilation of the commercial unit at the ground floor of no. 5 The Pavement due to the location of the extension against the ground floor windows contrary to Policy Q2 of the Lambeth Local Plan 2020-2035 (2021).",
    "In the absence of detailed plans demonstrating that each unit is able to provide safe and secure storage for two bicycles, the applicant has failed to demonstrate the total number of long and short stay cycle spaces would be conveniently located in a safe and covered store for the future occupants and visitors. The proposal would be contrary to Policy Q13 and T3 of the Lambeth Local Plan 2020-2035 (2021) and Policy T5 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "In the absence of a Unilateral Undertaking or other legal agreement securing appropriate mitigation by restricting future occupiers of the development from obtaining parking permits within the Controlled Parking Zone, providing car club membership and cycle hire scheme, the proposed development would likely exacerbate existing parking stress and congestion on the surrounding highway network. The application is therefore contrary to Policies D4, T1 and T7 of the Lambeth Local Plan 2020-2035 (2021) and Policy T6 of the London Plan (2021)."
