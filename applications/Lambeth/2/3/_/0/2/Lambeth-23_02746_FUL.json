    "The proposed second and third floor flat fails to meet the minimum expected internal floorspace for a 3 bedroom, 4 person unit as well as the minimum floor to ceiling height of 2.5m for at least 75% of the proposed dwelling. Furthermore, the proposed second and third floor unit would fail to provide the necessary level of outdoor amenity space, 10sqm, and in this instance, no exceptions can be made as there is not any additional internal floorspace that could cover this shortfall. The proposed second and third floor unit would result in the creation of substandard quality of residential accommodation to the detriment of future occupiers contrary to Policies H5 and H6 of the Lambeth Local Plan 2020-2035 (2021) and Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "The proposed second floor rear extension by reason of its excessive scale, mass and bulk would result in an incongruous and overly dominant addition that overwhelms the rear elevation of the host building by eroding the rear profile of the building particularly where the historic rear wall of the second floor remains undeveloped. Furthermore, the projecting balcony at second floor level, would further exacerbate the visual harm to the appearance of the building because the large door units are not characteristic features of the Victorian building and its group. The development would fail to appear subordinate and neither preserves or enhances the character and appearance of the host building and the wider Brixton Conservation Area. The development would result in a low degree of less than substantial harm to the character and appearance of the Brixton Conservation Area which is not outweighed by any public benefits. The proposal would be contrary to Policies Q2, Q5, Q8, Q11 and Q22 of the Lambeth Local Plan 2020-2035 (2021), the National Planning Policy Framework (2023) and the Lambeth Design Guide (2023).",
    "The proposed mansard roof extension by reasons of its design, scale, layout and mass extending over the proposed two-storey extension would result in the loss of the historic pitched roof for a highly prominent, incongruous and dominant addition that fails to appear subordinate in context with the host building and its group. Furthermore, front dormer windows and balconies are uncharacteristic features of the building which further exacerbates the visual harm to the character of the Victorian building and the terrace. The development would neither preserve or enhance the character and appearance of the host building and the wider Brixton Conservation Area and would result in a low degree of less than substantial harm to the character and appearance of the Brixton Conservation Area which is not outweighed by any public benefits. The proposal would be contrary to Policies Q2, Q5, Q8, Q11 and Q22 of the Lambeth Local Plan 2020-2035 (2021), the National Planning Policy Framework (2023) and the Lambeth Design Guide (2023).",
    "The proposed development due to the proposed rear balcony, new fenestration arrangement and residential conversion would have an adverse impact on amenity in terms of privacy and noise and disturbance for the occupants of no. 21 Connaught Mansions, no. 388 Coldharbour Lane and no. 48 Atlantic Road. Furthermore, the proposal would have an overbearing impact on the occupants of no. 48 Atlantic Road. In the absence of a fully 'BRE' compliant report it has not been demonstrated that the scheme would not result in loss of daylight/sunlight for the occupiers of no.48 Atlantic Road. The proposal would be contrary to Policy Q2 of the Lambeth Local Plan 2020-2035 (2021).",
    "In the absence of a Unilateral Undertaking or other legal agreement securing appropriate mitigation by restricting future occupiers of the development from obtaining parking permits within the Controlled Parking Zone, providing car club membership and cycle hire scheme, and Sheffield stands, the proposed development would likely exacerbate existing parking stress and congestion on the surrounding highway network. The application is therefore contrary to Policies D4, T1 and T7 of the Lambeth Local Plan 2020-2035 (2021) and Policy T6 of the London Plan (2021)."
