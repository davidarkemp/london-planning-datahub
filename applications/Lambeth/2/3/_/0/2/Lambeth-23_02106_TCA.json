  "description": "T4: x1 Norway Maple. Suggested work - fell and replace. \r\rReason - there were originally 4 trees in pits along this stretch of pavement, three of which have failed. This is primarily due to poor growing conditions with the supporting roots being forced to the surface, pushing up surrounding paving slabs and curb stones. It is proposed to remove this remaining tree and plant four replacement trees in the large green space to the rear of the blocks.",
