    "The proposed first floor side extension would result in unacceptable alteration to the roof form and unbalance the symmetrical form of the main roof. Consequently, the proposal would fail to adequately preserve or enhance the character and appearance of the host dwelling and the wider Streatham Park and Garrads Road Conservation Area. The less than substantial harm identified to the conservation area would not be outweighed by any public benefits of the scheme. The proposal therefore fails to comply with the Lambeth's Design Guide SPD (2023) and policies Q5, Q11 and Q22 of the Lambeth Local Plan 2020-2035 (2021) and paragraph 202 of the NPPF.",

The less than substantial harm identified to the conservation area would not be outweighed by any public benefits of the scheme.  The proposal therefore fails to comply with the Lambeth's Design Guide SPD (2023) and policies Q5, Q11, Q22 and Q27 of the Lambeth Local Plan 2020-2035 (2021) and paragraph 202 of the NPPF.\r\r",
