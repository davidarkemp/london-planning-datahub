Additionally the development contributes towards opportunities to engage in anti-social behaviour to the detriment of community. As such the application is contrary to Local Plan Policy ED8 (Evening economy and food and drink uses), Q2 (Amenity), Q3 (Safety, crime prevention and counter terrorism), T1 (Sustainable travel), T2 (Walking), T3 (Cycling), T6 (Parking), T7 (Servicing) of the Lambeth Local Plan 2020-2035, and Policies T2 (Healthy Streets), T4 (Assessing and mitigating transport impacts), T5 (Cycling) and T7 (Deliveries, servicing and construction) of the London Plan 2021.",
    "Insufficient on-site operational parking to appropriately service the development within a limited area and inadequate non-operational blue badge parking is provided. The proposed development also does not provide electric bike charging facilities and insufficient facilities such as showers, and changing rooms are not provided. The development is therefore unacceptable in relation to road safety and in relation to sustainable transport, health and wellbeing, contrary to Policies Q1 (Inclusive environments), T1 (Sustainable travel), T3 (Cycling), T6 (Parking) and T7 (Servicing) of Lambeth Local Plan 2020-2035 and Policies T2 (Healthy Streets), T4 (Assessing and mitigating transport impacts) and T7 (Deliveries, servicing and construction) of the London Plan 2021.",
    "The submission has failed to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority that the development would provide satisfactory provision of residual and recyclable waste storage in the interest of amenity and would harm the setting of the character and appearance of the adjoining conservation area. The submission is contrary to Policy Q12 (Refuse and recycling) and Q22 (Conservation areas) of the Lambeth Local Plan 2020-2035 and the council's Refuse and Recycling Storage Design Guide and Waste and Recycling Storage and Collection Requirements - Technical Specifications for Architects and Developers.",
    "In the absence of an Air Quality Neutral Assessment, the application has failed establish that the proposed development will be at least Air Quality Neutral, failing to accord with the requirements of Policy SI1 (Air Quality) of the London Plan 2021. \r\r"
