    "The proposal would provide substandard residential accommodation which would be to the detriment of the amenities of future occupiers. This is due to a lack of outdoor amenity space or additional compensatory internal living space for Flats 2 and 3. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies H5 and Q2 of the Lambeth Local Plan (2021).",
    "There is a lack of cycle storage provision for units 2 and 3, and the proposed cycle store for unit 1 is in an unpractical location, layout and design, which would not be easily accessible and would not be appropriately secure. The overall provision would not meet the required amount of cycle parking for the number and unit type. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy T5 of the London Plan (2021) and Policy Q13 of the Lambeth Local Plan (2021).",
    "The proposed rear mansard roof extension by reason of its detailed design (including the height of the roof extension and inclusion of a door) would not respond positively to and would harm the character and appearance of the host building and terrace row and would result in a dominant and discordant addition. The proposal is contrary to Policies Q2, Q5, Q8 and Q11 of the Local Plan 2021 and the Lambeth Design Guide SPD Part 4: Building Alterations, Extensions and Retrofit (2023).",
    "The proposed roof terrace and screening, by virtue of its size, location, design and materials, would not positively respond to and fails to respect the original architecture and built form of the host building, terrace row and the character and appearance of the locality. It creates additional visual clutter and would be a dominant addition to the host building. The proposal is therefore contrary to policies Q2, Q5, Q8 and Q11 of the Lambeth Local Plan (2021) and the Lambeth Design Guide SPD Part 4: Building Alterations, Extensions and Retrofit (2023).",
    "In the absence of a completed S106 agreement securing appropriate mitigation by restricting future occupiers of the development from obtaining parking permits within the Controlled Parking Zone, providing car club membership and providing cycle hire membership, the proposed development would likely exacerbate existing parking stress and congestion on the surrounding highway network and would fail to encourage sustainable modes of transport. The proposal is therefore contrary to policies D4, T1 and T6 of the Lambeth Local Plan (2021) and Policy T6 of the London Plan (2021)."
