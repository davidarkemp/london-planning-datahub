    "No development shall commence on site until a detailed Sustainable Drainage System (SuDS) Strategy document has been provided for approval by the Local Planning Authority. The SuDS Strategy must include a detailed design, maintenance schedule, confirmation of the management arrangement. The SuDS Strategy must also demonstrate the technical feasibility/viability of the drainage system through the use of SuDS to manage the flood risk to the site for the life time of the development. The approved scheme for the surface water drainage shall be carried out in accordance with the approved details before the development is first put in to use/occupied.  \n \nReason: To ensure the development is provided with a satisfactory means of drainage and in the interests of securing a more sustainable development and to reduce the impact of flooding both to and from the development and third parties in accordance with Policies SI12 and SI13 of the London Plan (2021) and Policy EN6 of the Lambeth Local Plan (2021).",
    "Prior to the erection of a waste storage to the front of the property (as shown on drawing no P12), details of waste and recycling storage for the development shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority.  The waste and recycling storage shall be provided in accordance with the approved details prior to the commencement of the use hereby permitted, and shall thereafter be retained solely for its designated use. \n \nReason: To ensure suitable provision for the occupiers of the development, to encourage the sustainable management of waste and to safeguard the visual amenities of the area (Policies EN7, Q2 and Q12 of the London Borough of Lambeth Local Plan (2015))."
