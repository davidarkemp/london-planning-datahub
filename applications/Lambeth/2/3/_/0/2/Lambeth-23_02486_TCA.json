Reason - poor specimen, and due to previous pruning the tree has become completely one sided. It is also growing butt up to boundary and will damage fence in due course. \r\rT2: x1 Bay Tree, loacted to the rear of the site. Suggested work - fell in sections to ground level and treat stump with eco plugs to prevent regrowth. Reason - extremely large cavity at 1m rendering tree unsafe. \r\r",
