    "The proposed second floor flat (Flat B) fails to meet the minimum in-built storage and minimum internal floor space for a 1 bedroom, 2 person unit. Furthermore, the proposed roof level unit (Flat C) fails to have a minimum floor to ceiling height of  2.5m for at least 75 per cent (37.8sq.m) of the unit to address London's unique heat island affect. Whilst the scheme would provide private outdoor amenity space for Flats B and C, the areas of 2.43sq.m and 4.15sq.m fall short of the required 10sq.m for flatted development nor would this be provided through an uplift in internal floor area. The proposal would result in substandard quality of residential accommodation to the detriment of future occupiers contrary to Policies H5 and H6 of the Lambeth Local Plan 2020-2035 (2021) and Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "The proposed two-storey rear extension at first and second floors by reasons of its excessive scale, mass and bulk would result in an incongruous and overly dominant addition that overwhelms the rear elevation of the host building by eroding the rear profile of the building particularly where the historic rear wall of the second floor remains undeveloped. Furthermore, the projecting balconies would further exacerbate the visual harm to the appearance of the building because the large door units are not characteristic features of the Victorian building and its group. The development would fail to appear subordinate and neither preserves or enhances the character and appearance of the host building and the wider Brixton Conservation Area. The development would result in a low degree of less than substantial harm to the character and appearance of the Brixton Conservation Area which is not outweighed by any public benefits. The proposal would be contrary to Policies Q2, Q5, Q8, Q11 and Q22 of the Lambeth Local Plan 2020-2035 (2021), the National Planning Policy Framework (2023) and the Lambeth Design Guide (2023).",
    "The proposed mansard roof extension by reasons of its design, scale, layout and mass extending over the proposed two-storey extension would result in the loss of the historic pitched roof for a highly prominent, incongruous and dominant addition that fails to appear subordinate in context with the host building and its group. Furthermore, front dormer windows and balconies are uncharacteristic features of the building which further exacerbates the visual harm to the character of the Victorian building and the terrace. The development would neither preserve or enhance the character and appearance of the host building and the wider Brixton Conservation Area and would result in a low degree of less than substantial harm to the character and appearance of the Brixton Conservation Area which is not outweighed by any public benefits. The proposal would be contrary to Policies Q2, Q5, Q8, Q11 and Q22 of the Lambeth Local Plan 2020-2035 (2021), the National Planning Policy Framework (2023) and the Lambeth Design Guide (2023).",
    "The development would reduce the space between no. 46 Atlantic Road and no. 21 Connaught Mansions to an approximate width of 9m and the occupants of no. 21 would be able to overlook from the side windows and the roof terrace directly, closely and comfortably through the proposed rear door units and amenity spaces of Flats A, B and C of the host building. Due to the loss of privacy and overlooking afforded to the future occupiers, the proposal would be contrary to Policies Q2, H5 and H6 of the Lambeth Local Plan 2020-2035 (2021).",
    "The proposed development due to the proposed rear balconies, new fenestration arrangement and residential conversion would have an adverse impact on amenity in terms of privacy and noise and disturbance for the occupants of no. 21 Connaught Mansions, no. 388 Coldharbour Lane and no. 48 Atlantic Road. Furthermore, the proposal would have an overbearing impact on the occupants of no. 21 Connaught Mansions and no. 48 Atlantic Road. In the absence of a fully 'BRE' compliant report it has not been demonstrated that the scheme would not result in loss of daylight/sunlight for the occupants of no. 21 Connaught Mansions and 48 Atlantic Road. The development would block outlook and light into the first-floor windows of the adjacent commercial Market Row Grade II Listed Building/44 Atlantic Road. The proposal would be contrary to Policy Q2 of the Lambeth Local Plan 2020-2035 (2021).",
    "In the absence of a Unilateral Undertaking or other legal agreement securing appropriate mitigation by restricting future occupiers of the development from obtaining parking permits within the Controlled Parking Zone, providing car club membership and cycle hire scheme, and Sheffield stands, the proposed development would likely exacerbate existing parking stress and congestion on the surrounding highway network. The application is therefore contrary to Policies D4, T1 and T7 of the Lambeth Local Plan 2020-2035 (2021) and Policy T6 of the London Plan (2021)."
