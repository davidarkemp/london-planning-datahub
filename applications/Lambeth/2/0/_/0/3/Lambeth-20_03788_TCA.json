  "description": "Rear Garden. Overhanging from the school\rT1\tCherry x 1 (Prunus spp) This is an offsite tree. Our client has historically taken the maintenance of this tree under their remit. That said we will still need to gain approval from the tree owners (Lambeth Council). Reduce height by 2.5m, to match Ivy clump on tree adjacent to the right-hand side), reduce lateral growth by approximately 1.5m laterally to shape. Remove any deadwood and clean out crown, including old pruning.\rFront traffic calming planter\rGP\tSilver Birch x 6\t(Betula pendula / alba) This is a group of off- site trees, The planting and maintenance of these trees has been undertaken by our client. They sit in a council owned bed, which was installed as part of traffic calming measures. We will need to source permissions from the local authority prior to carrying out any works to these trees. This is a group of 6 x multi-stemmed paperbark Birch trees. These trees are approx 6m tall. Crown reduce height by approximately 1.5-2m, reduce all lateral growth to re-shape and balance this equates to 75cm - 1m. All cuts will be small 2.5 cm or less and will be back to suitable growth points. Prune back overhang to curb line where the trees are getting rubbed form passing high sided vehicles.",
