    "The proposal would not provide high quality accommodation because (i) it would not provide sufficient private amenity space for flats 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 9 and no communal amenity space is provided to compensate for this; (ii) Flats 1 and 2 may have insufficient light and no sunlight and daylight assessment has been provided to demonstrate adequate internal levels of light would be achieved; (iii) Flat 1 would have poor outlook and suffer from direct overlooking from the communal areas, the living room may also suffer poor odours being located adjacent to the proposed waste storage; (iv) it has not been demonstrated that noise from the pub will be appropriately mitigated. The application is contrary to policies Q2 and H5 of the Lambeth Local Plan 2021 and D6 and D13 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "The proposed application does not make provision for appropriate and safe location for waste collection. Collection directly from Norwood Road raises concerns about highways and pedestrian safety. The proposed waste management is contrary to policy T7 of the Lambeth Local Plan 2021 and the Waste & recycling storage and collection requirements, Technical Specification for Architects & Designers (2023).",
    "In the absence of a s106 agreement to secure (i) Car permit free development; (ii) Car Club membership for a period of 3 years for the future residents; and (iii) cycle hire membership for a period of 3 years for future residents. The proposed development has the potential to unacceptably impact on on-street parking pressures and the safety of the local highway network. The proposal fails to comply with policies T3 and T6 of the Lambeth Local Plan 2021 and T5 and T6 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "Insufficient information has been provided to demonstrate high standard of sustainable design and construction online with policy EN4 of the Lambeth Local Plan 2015 and SI1, SI2 and SI3 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "In the absence of a tree survey and arboricultural impact assessment, officers are unable to assess the impact of the proposed development on the existing trees and the impact of retained trees on the proposed dwellings. The application fails to demonstrate compliance with policy Q10 of the Lambeth Local Plan 2021.",
    "The proposed development, by reason of the shared narrow access to the proposed residential flats, art studios and the rear of the restaurant/bar would result in conflict between the different users and would provide an unacceptable form of access that would also fail to help integrate the proposed scheme within the existing public realm and would create an unsafe and potentially intimidating access environments for future occupiers of the residential units. As such, the proposal would be contrary to policy Q3, Q6 and Q7 of the Lambeth Local Plan (2021)."
