  "description": "TPO No. 29, March 1975, Individual Tree: T11 Holm Oak:\rT1 (T11 Holm Oak):\rDiameter at Breast Height (DBH): 1.8m\rTotal tree height: 23m\rCrown height from ground level: between 3 to 4m\rCrown spread at each compass point (North, South, East, West): N 12m / S 11m / E 10m / W 5m\rWorks: Crown reduction by up to 3m in height and lateral spread to bring back from building, contain tree, and balance crown. Reduce crown spread to new dimensions of approximately: Height 21m, N 10m, S 9m, E 8m, W 4m.\rAdditional factors: Decay present within the main stem and primary branches; cavities within structural branches; fruiting body of Ganoderma spp. present; over-extended laterals over high-value targets (buildings, traffic, streetlight); encroachment on buildings and within failure distance of A3. Reduction aims to mitigate lever arm forces and manage risk.\rReason: Tree has significant decay and structural issues; works proposed to manage risk, reduce crown loading, and limit encroachment onto nearby structures.\r",
