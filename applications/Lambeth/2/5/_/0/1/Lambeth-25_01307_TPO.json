  "description": "TPO No. 16, December 1969, Individual Trees: T12 Tilia species.\rT1 (T12 Tilia species):\rReduce height and laterals by 2m from branch ends.\rCut back overhang from building, almost to boundary line (2m from branch ends).\rCrown lift to crown break approximately 2.5m from ground level.\rMaintain growth in center of tree to preserve green screen.\rReason: Tree previously managed as a reduction; works proposed to maintain previous management, manage growth towards neighbouring properties, and retain amenity value.\r\rT2 Laurus nobilis:\rRemove to ground level.\rNote: The Laurus nobilis is not protected by TPO No. 16 (1969) but is within the Albert Square Conservation Area. The Council does not object to these works.\rReason: Small garden, tree is vigorous and dominating the space. Inappropriate species for location.\r",
