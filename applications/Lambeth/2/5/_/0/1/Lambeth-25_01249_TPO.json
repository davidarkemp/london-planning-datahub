  "description": "TPO No. 3, May 1959, T29 Lime and T30 Lime, Front Garden\rT29: Lime North-west corner  (known as 7246):  Repollard tree to previous reduction points by approximately 3 to 4m. Rigidiporus fungi on stem (east and SE aspect around 1m). Overhangs highway with high target area. Reduce crown to previous reduction points.\rT30: Lime (known as 7245):  Repollard tree at historic points around approx. 12m. Overhangs highway. Dense sucker growth typical of species restricting detailed inspection although recently pruned.\rReason: Works required as part of cyclical highway safety management. T29 has early-stage decay confirmed by tomography and fungal fruiting bodies present; repollarding is precautionary. T30 requires standard repollarding to control regrowth and maintain clearance over the TfL Red Route.\r",
