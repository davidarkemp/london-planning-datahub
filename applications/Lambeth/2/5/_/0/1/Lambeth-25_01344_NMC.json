  "description": "Application for a non-material amendment following a grant of planning permission ref. 24/02367/FUL (Upgrade to the rooftop telecommunications, involving the removal of 9 x antennas and their replacement with 9 x Antennas and 3 x modified freestanding frames and the installation of 1x cabinet, the retention of the existing VF dish, along with associated ancillary works) granted on 15.01.2025.\r\rAmendment sought: The primary change is a reduction in the number of antennas from 9 to 6 overall (with 2 antennas per sector instead of 3 antennas per sector), and a corresponding reduction in associated steelwork. This will in turn reduce the overall bulk and visual impact of the installation, which is particularly relevant given the site's location within a designated conservation area.",
