Permission to fell the tree was given in 2017 (17/00993/TPO) on the ground that the tree was hazardous, due to extensive decay at the stem base.  However, the owner (the Lambeth & Southwark Housing Association) did not carry out the consented work within the 2 year validity of that consent.  The work needs to be carried out as the tree continues to be hazardous.\r\rBy this application renewed consent is sought to the felling of the tree, so that the work can now been carried out.\r\rA replacement tree will be planted.",
