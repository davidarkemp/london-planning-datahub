    "By virtue of the increase in bulk and massing to the side of the existing dwelling 129 Clarence Avenue, the proposed two-storey side extension would unbalance the pair of semi-detached properties thus adversely detracting from their architectural character and appearance and the contribution the pair make to the integrity of the design of the wider grouping of semi-detached properties along Clarence Avenue. As such the proposal would subsequently detract from the character and appearance of the locality, contrary to policies Q5 and Q11 of the Lambeth Local Plan (2021) and the guidance as contained within the Council's Building alterations and extensions SPD 2015.",
