The submitted document aims to resolve these design limitations with a careful consideration of building regulation compliance, maintenance limitations and construction feasibility whilst simultaneously increasing the quality of the scheme. The submitted document also puts particular focus on the maintenance aspect to ensure a longer building life-cycle.",
