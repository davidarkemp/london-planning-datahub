Thereafter, the respective Method Statements shall be implemented in strict accordance with the approved details.\n\nReason: To ensure the retention of, and avoid damage to, the retained trees on and adjacent to the site that represent an important visual amenity to the locality and wider surrounding area (Policy G7 of the London Plan (2021) and Policies Q2, Q10 and Q22 of the Lambeth Local Plan (2021)).",
