    "Your attention is drawn to the need to comply with the requirements of the Control of Pollution Act 1974 concerning construction site noise and in this respect you are advised to contact the Council's Environmental Health Division.",
    "You are advised of the necessity to consult the Council's Highways team prior to the commencement of construction on 020 7926 9000 in order to obtain necessary approvals and licences prior to undertaking any works within the Public Highway including Scaffolding, Temporary/Permanent Crossovers, Oversailing/Undersailing of the Highway, Drainage/Sewer Connections, Hoarding, Excavations (including adjacent to the highway such as basements, etc), Temporary Full/Part Road Closures, Craneage Licences etc.",
    "The proposed extension, by reason of its design, bulk and siting, would appear as an over-dominant addition to the host building, which would fail to achieve subordination and disrupt the uniformity of the terrace on which it sits. The proposal would fail to respond to the positive aspects of the original architecture of the host building or the surrounding area. The proposed development would result in less than substantial harm to the character and appearance of Vauxhall Conservation Area. This harm would not be outweighed by the public benefits which flow from the scheme. As such, the proposed development would not comply with policies Q5, Q11, Q22 of the Lambeth Local Plan 2020-2035 (2021) and Paragraph 202 of the NPPF.",
    "The proposed additional height, bulk and siting of extension work located at the 2nd, 3rd and roof levels would result in an unacceptable cumulative amenity impact to No. 41 South Lambeth Road, as a result of an unacceptable loss of outlook and increased sense of overbearing and enclosure.  In addition, the applicant has failed to demonstrate that the proposal would not result in an unacceptable loss of daylight and sunlight to neighbouring habitable rooms.  The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy Q2 of the Lambeth Local Plan 2020-2035 (2021)."
