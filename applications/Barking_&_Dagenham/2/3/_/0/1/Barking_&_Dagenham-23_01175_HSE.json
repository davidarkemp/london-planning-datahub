    "&lt;p style=&quot;&quot;&gt;The proposed development when combined would add a significant amount of massing and bulk to the existing property. The application site, as well as the surrounding buildings, are relatively modest in massing and scale and possess a coherent character and appearance with a sense of spaciousness between each of the buildings. The proposed extensions would introduce significant and incongruous architectural massing to the side and rear which is out of keeping with the surrounding buildings and would present a departure from the coherent appearance and they represent an over-development of the site. It is deemed that the extensions do not read as a subservient addition to the host property and detract away from the original design. The proposal is therefore considered to be contrary to:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Paragraphs 126, 130, and&amp;nbsp;134, 203 of the National Planning Policy Framework (July 2021);&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Policies D1,&amp;nbsp;D4, HC1&amp;nbsp;of the London Plan (March 2021);&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Policies&amp;nbsp;CP2 and CP3 of the Core Strategy DPD (July 2010);&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Policies BP2 and&amp;nbsp;BP11 of the Borough Wide Development Plan Document DPD (March 2011);&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Policies SP2,&amp;nbsp;DMD1, DMD4, and DMD6&amp;nbsp;of the London Borough of Barking and Dagenhamâ€™s Draft Local Plan 2037 (Regulation 19 Submission Version, December 2021); and&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sections 5.3 and 5.4 of The Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document (February 2012).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;"
