    "&lt;p style=&quot;&quot;&gt;The proposed development, by reason of its design such as the&amp;nbsp;roof form and fenestration detail including window design  is considered to be inconsistent and unreflective of the design and character of the main dwellinghouse and would have&amp;nbsp;harmful to the appearance of the property.&amp;nbsp; Furthermore, the scale, size and siting of the proposed development combined with the&amp;nbsp;existing side extensions, would over double the size of the front elevation of the dwelling making the property and terrace row appear lopsided and unbalanced, this would be at odds with the uniform character of the area.
