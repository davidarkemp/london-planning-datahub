    "The proposed new dwelling, by reason of scale, design and layout, would fail to meet the nationally described space standards. As such, it would fail to provide an acceptable quality of accommodation, causing harm to the living standards of future occupants. The proposal is thus considered to be at odds with the following policies which support development that provides high-quality accommodation and living conditions:&nbsp;National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) (DLUHC, 2021)Policies D4 and D6 of the London Plan (March 2021)Policies CM1 and CP3 of the LDF Core Strategy (July 2010)Policies BP8 and BP11 of the LDF Borough Wide Development Plan Document DPD (March 2011)Policies SP3, DMD1 and SP2 of the Draft Local Plan (Regulation 19 Submission Version, December 2021)Housing Design Standards London Plan Guidance (GLA, June 2023)",
    "The proposed new dwellinghouse, by reason of scale and siting, would be an undesirable addition which would close off the openness of the corner plot and result in a loss of the sense of spaciousness and green space currently afforded to the site, which forms a part of the local distinctiveness of the area. It would also result in the loss of the views down Carrow Road.&nbsp; The proposal would therefore be detrimental to the character and appearance of the surrounding area, as well as to the historic character of the Becontree Estate.
