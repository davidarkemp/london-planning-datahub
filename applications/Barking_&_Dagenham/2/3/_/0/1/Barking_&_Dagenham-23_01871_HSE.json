    "&lt;p&gt;The\r\nproposal, by reason of siting, mass, scale, bulk and design, would be an\r\nundesirable addition which would\r\nnot appear subservient to the original dwelling, would close off a characteristic gap between terraces and would present an incohesive roofscape. As such, it fails to respect or reflect the character of the original\r\ndwelling, the terrace row of which it forms a part, and the surrounding area,\r\ncausing harm to each of these as well as to the street scene along both Gerald Road and Fordyke Road.&amp;nbsp; In addition, the proposal would have an unacceptable impact on the historic character of the Becontree Estate. The proposal thus fails to accord with the\r\nfollowing policies which seek to ensure development recognises local character and promotes good design\r\nwhilst protecting and enhancing historic environments:\r\n&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Paragraph 131, 135, 195, and 209 of the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) (DLUHC, 2023)\r\n&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Policies D4 and HC1 of\r\n     the London Plan (March 2021)\r\n&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Policies\r\n     CP2 and CP3 of the&amp;nbsp;Local Development Framework (LDF) Core Strategy\r\n     (July 2010)\r\n&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Policies BP8\r\n     and BP11 of the&amp;nbsp;Local Development Framework (LDF) Borough Wide\r\n     Development Plan Document (DPD) (March 2011)\r\n&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Paragraph 5.3 and 5.4 of the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary\r\n     Planning Document (February 2012)\r\n&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Policies\r\n     SP2, DMD1, DMD4 and DMD6 of&amp;nbsp;The London Borough of Barking and Dagenham’s Draft\r\n     Local Plan: (Regulation 19 Submission Version, December 2021)\r\n&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;",
    "&lt;p&gt;The proposal, by reason of siting, scale and design,\r\nwould be an undesirable addition which would cause unacceptable loss of daylight, sunlight, outlook and privacy to neighbouring\r\ndwellings. This would result in a harmful impact to the amenity currently\r\nenjoyed by neighbouring occupiers. As such, the proposal fails to protect residential\r\namenity and constitutes un-neighbourly development. The proposal thus fails to\r\naccord with the following policies which seek to ensure that development\r\nproposals protect residential amenity:\r\n&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Paragraph 135(f) of the National Planning Policy Framework\r\n     (NPPF) (DLUHC, 2023)\r\n&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Policy D6 of the London Plan (March 2021)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Policies&amp;nbsp;BP8 and BP11 of the&amp;nbsp;Local Development\r\n     Framework (LDF) Borough Wide Development Plan Document (DPD) (March 2011)\r\n&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Paragraph 4.2, 5.3, and 5.4 of the Residential Extensions and\r\n     Alterations Supplementary Planning Document (February 2012)\r\n&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Policies DMD1 and DMD6 of&amp;nbsp;The London Borough of Barking\r\n     and Dagenham’s Draft Local Plan: (Regulation 19 Submission Version,\r\n     December 2021)\r\n&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;"
