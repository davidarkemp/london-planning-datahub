    "&lt;p&gt;The proposed development fails to provide sufficient information with respect to transport impacts and subsequent mitigation measures. In the absence of such, the proposal is likely to worsen the existing condition along Tenby Close with regards to access and egress, parking pressure and pedestrian safety. It is also likely to cause disruption to High Road and vehicular and pedestrian conflict within the site.&amp;nbsp; The proposal further fails to demonstrate safe and adequate car and cycle parking, and safe access for pedestrians and cyclists entering the site. The proposal is therefore likely to result in a detrimental impact on highway safety and the existing transport network, to the detriment of sustainable travel principles. It is therefore contrary to the following:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Chapter 9 of the National Planning Policy Framework&amp;nbsp;(NPPF) (DLUHC, December 2023)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Policies T1, T2, T3, T4, T5 and T6 of the London Plan (March 2021)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Policy CR1 of the&amp;nbsp;Local Development Framework Core Strategy (July 2010)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Policies&amp;nbsp;BR10 and BR11 of the&amp;nbsp;Local Development Framework Borough Wide Development Plan Document (March 2011)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Policies SP8, DMT1, DMT2 and DMT3 of&amp;nbsp;The London Borough of Barking and Dagenham’s Draft Local Plan: (Regulation 19 Submission Version, December 2021)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;",
