    "&lt;p style=&quot;&quot;&gt;The proposed development by reason of its siting, scale, massing, bulk, design&amp;nbsp;would introduce a discordant feature and therefore would fail to make a positive contribution to the&amp;nbsp;character and appearance of the dwellinghouse, the terrace, and wider Becontree Estate which is a non-designated heritage asset know for its homogeneous&amp;nbsp;appearance and layout.&amp;nbsp;In addition, the proposed development represents an overdevelopment of the site. The proposed extension when taken into consideration&amp;nbsp;with the existing extensions on site would be&amp;nbsp;disproportionate to the size of the curtilage of the property. This would mean that in relation to the amount of people able to potentially live in the space created, the available open space would not be sufficient.&amp;nbsp;The proposal is therefore contrary to:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Paragraphs 131, 135, 139, and 209&amp;nbsp;of the National Planning Policy Framework (December&amp;nbsp;2023)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Policies D4, D6 and HC1 of the London Plan (March 2021)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Policies CP2 and CP3 of the&amp;nbsp;Local Development Framework (LDF) Core Strategy (July 2010)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Policies BP8 and BP11 of the&amp;nbsp;Local Development Framework (LDF) Borough Wide Development Plan Document (DPD) (March 2011)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Policies SP2, DMD1, DMD4 and DMD6 of the London Borough of Barking and Dagenham’s Draft Local Plan 2037: (Regulation 19 Submission Version, December 2021)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Paragraph 5.3.3(c and d) of the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document (February 2012)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;",
