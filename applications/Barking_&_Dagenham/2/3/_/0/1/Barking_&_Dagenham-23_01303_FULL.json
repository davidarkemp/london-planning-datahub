    "The proposed cycle storage would be poorly located within the rear garden of the proposed dwelling therefore would be easily accessible from the highway, thus would essentially be unusable. This would be inadequate and is therefore considered unacceptable contrary to:Policy&nbsp;T5 and Tables 10.2 of the London Plan (March 2021)Policy BR11 of the&nbsp;Local Development Framework (LDF) Borough Wide Development Plan Document (DPD) (March 2011)Policy DMT3 of the&nbsp;&nbsp;London Borough of Barking and Dagenham’s Draft Local Plan 2037&nbsp;(Regulation 19 Submission Version, December 2021)London Cycling Design Standards (September 2016)",
    "The&nbsp;proposed development therefore fails to provide adequate off-street parking for both the existing and proposed dwellinghouse&nbsp;and has failed to demonstrate that not providing sufficient off-street parking would not result in a harmful impact and increased stress on&nbsp;parking along St Davids Road, notably due to the existing Controlled Parking Zone. As such, the car parking strategy proposed&nbsp;is deemed to be unacceptable.Policies T6 and&nbsp;T6.1 of the&nbsp;London Plan (March 2021) Policies BR9 and BR11&nbsp;of the&nbsp;Local Development Framework (LDF) Borough Wide Development Plan Document (DPD) (March 2011)Policies DMT 2 and DMT3 of&nbsp;&nbsp;the London Borough of Barking and Dagenham’s Draft Local Plan 2037&nbsp;(Regulation 19 Submission Version, December 2021)",
    "The proposed dwellinghouse, for reasons of design and siting, would result in a significant loss of privacy for neighbouring dwelling, no.47 Lynnett Road.&nbsp;Further, the proposal will double the the number of households on site,&nbsp;significantly increasing the number of occupants using the site and&nbsp;&nbsp;is therefore considered to generate more waste, light, noise, comings and goings and general disturbances than&nbsp;currently produced on site. The proposal is therefore considered to have an unacceptable impact on neighbouring amenity&nbsp;harmful to the standard of living of surrounding residents. The proposed development is considered unacceptable and contrary to:-Paragraph 130(f) of the National Planning Policy Framework (DLUHC, July 2021) Policy D6&nbsp;of the London Plan (March 2021); Policy CP3 of Local Development Framework (LDF) Core Strategy (July 2010) Policies BP8 and BP11 of the Local Development Framework (LDF) Borough Wide Development Plan Document (DPD) (March 2011) Policies SP2, DMD1 and DMD6 of the London Borough of Barking and Dagenham’s Draft Local Plan 2037&nbsp;(Regulation 19 Submission Version, December 2021)",
    "The proposed development would present a poor quality of accommodation, failing to provide an adequate Gross Internal Area for the corresponding number of users and presents a poorly ventilated dwelling which could result in overheating. The new dwelling would fail to provide an adequate external amenity space for proposed occupants and would cause a loss of the minimal existing amenity space the original dwelling has and as such would result in a harmful impact on impact on the existing dwelling and represents a low quality home. The proposal is therefore considered contrary to:-Policy D6 of the London Plan (March 2021)Policy BP5 of the&nbsp;Local Development Framework (LDF) Borough Wide Development Plan Document (DPD) (March 2011)Part 6 in Policy DMNE1 of the&nbsp;London Borough of Barking and Dagenham’s Draft Local Plan 2037&nbsp;(Regulation 19 Submission Version, December 2021)",
    "The proposed development, by reasons of design, bulk, mass, scale and siting appearing cramped and more akin to a large side extension rather than a dwellinghouse in its own right, incongruous and out of keeping with the prevailing character of the host dwelling and semi-detached pair. Further, the proposal would result in a detrimental loss of symmetry of the existing pair of dwellings and would close off the green open corner plot which would have a significantly harmful impact on the appearance and character of the streetcene. As a result, the proposed development is deemed to be unacceptable and contrary to:-&nbsp;Paragraphs 126, 130, and 134 of the National Planning Policy Framework (DLUHC, July 2021)Policies D1 and D4 of the London Plan (March 2021)Policy CP3 of the Local Development Framework (LDF) Core Strategy (July 2010)Policies BP8 and BP11 of the Local Development Framework (LDF) Borough Wide Development Plan Document (DPD) (March 2011)Policies SP2, DMD1 and DMD6 of the London Borough of Barking and Dagenham’s Draft Local Plan 2037 (Regulation 19 Submission Version, December 2021)"
