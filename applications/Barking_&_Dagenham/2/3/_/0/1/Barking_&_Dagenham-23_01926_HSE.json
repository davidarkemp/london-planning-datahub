    "The proposal, by reason of siting, mass, scale, bulk and design, would be an undesirable addition which would not appear subservient to the original dwelling, would substantially close the gap between terraces and which does not maintain the proportions of the original front elevation in its window design. As such, it fails to respect or reflect the character of the original dwelling, the terrace row of which it forms a part, and the surrounding area, causing harm to each of these as well as to the street scene along Burlington Gardens.&nbsp;The proposal thus fails to accord with the following policies which seek to ensure development proposals are well designed and respect and reflect the existing character: Paragraph 135 of the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) (DLUHC, December 2023) Policy&nbsp;D4&nbsp;of the London Plan (March 2021) Policies CP2 and CP3 of the&nbsp;Local Development Framework (LDF) Core Strategy (July 2010) Policies&nbsp;BP8 and BP11 of the&nbsp;Local Development Framework (LDF) Borough Wide Development Plan Document (DPD) (March 2011) Sections 4.1, 5.3 and 5.4 of the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document (February 2012)Policies SP2, DMD1 and DMD6 of the London Borough of Barking and Dagenhamâ€™s Draft Local Plan: (Regulation 19 Submission Version, December 2021)"
