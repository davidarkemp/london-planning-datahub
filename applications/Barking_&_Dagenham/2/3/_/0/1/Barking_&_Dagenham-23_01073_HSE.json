    "The proposal, by reason of siting, design, scale and bulk, would be an undesirable addition which would not appear subservient to the original dwelling, would introduce an incongruous&nbsp;roof form, would unbalance the symmetry across the&nbsp;terrace row and&nbsp;entrance to Amidas Gardens,&nbsp;would close off the openness of the corner plot and&nbsp;would disrupt the built form of a banjo cul-de-sac. As a result, it fails to respect or reflect the character of the original dwelling, terrace row and surrounding area, and&nbsp;fails to respect, preserve or enhance the local distinctiveness of the Becontree Estate.&nbsp;It would have a harmful impact on each of these, as well as on the street scene along Marlborough Road and Amidas Gardens.&nbsp;The proposal is thus contrary to the following policies which seek to ensure that development is of a high quality, has regard to local character and appearance and is sympathetic to the historic character:Paragraph 130 of the National Planning Policy Framework&nbsp;National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) (DLUHC, 2021)Policy D1, D4 and HC1 of the London Plan (March 2021)Policies CP2 and CP3 of the&nbsp;Local Development Framework (LDF) Core Strategy (July 2010)Policies BP2, BP8 and BP11 of the&nbsp;Local Development Framework (LDF) Borough Wide Development Plan Document (DPD) (March 2011)Sections 4.1 and 5.4 of the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document (February 2012)Policies SP2, DMD4&nbsp;and DMD6 of&nbsp;The London Borough of Barking and Dagenhamâ€™s Draft Local Plan: (Regulation 19 Submission Version, December 2021)"
