    "The development failed to demonstrate that the change of use from a family house and House in Multiple Occupation (HMO) would not unacceptably increase local parking stress. The application site is in an area with low transport accessibility and it is proposed for 12 unrelated individuals to live at this address. This could have significant impact on the local road network. In an absence of any documents showing otherwise the application is considered unacceptable and contrary to:Policy T6 of the London Plan (March 2021); andPolicy BR15 of the Borough Wide DPD (March 2011).",
    "The development fails to provide&nbsp;safe&nbsp;and secure cycle parking spaces that comply with the London Cycling Design Standards. As such, the development is contrary to:Policy T5 of the London Plan (March 2021);Policy BR9 of the Borough Wide DPD (March 2011); andPolicy DMT 3 of the Draft Local Plan 2037 Regulation 19 consultation version (December 2021).",
    "The development fails to provide the required number of waste and recycling bins, that would be positioned in a convenient and appropriate location within the site. As such, the development is contrary to:Policy BR15 of the Borough Wide DPD (March 2011); Policy DMSI 8&nbsp;of the Draft Local Plan 2037 Regulation 19 consultation version (December 2021);&nbsp;andLBBD Planning Advice Note on Waste and Recycling Provisions in New and Refurbished Residential Developments (20 May 2021).",
    "The proposed development would result in some of the proposed bedrooms being inadeqautely located in terms of access to houshould communal spaces and bathrooms. Many rooms would be poorly lit by daylight and ventiliated with a lack of built-in storage. As such the proposal is contrary to the following:&amp;nbsp;Policy D6 of the London Plan (March 2021)Part C4 of The Housing Design Standards London Planning Guidance (June 2023)",
    "The proposed HMO has the potential to increase activity level and coming and goings to and from the site leading to additional levels of noise and disturbance at the property. This is considered to have a negative impact on neighbouring amenity in this street of family housing&nbsp;and in turn the health and wellbeing of neighbouring residents. As such the proposal is contrary to the following:Policies DMD 1, SP 7 and DMSI 3 of the Draft Local Plan; andPolicies BP8 and BP11 of the&nbsp;Borough Wide DPD (March 2011).",
    "The proposed development&nbsp;results in a loss of a large&nbsp;family-sized unit which is a priority house type within the Borough.&nbsp;As such, the proposal is considered unacceptable and contrary to the following:Policy BC4 of the Borough Wide DPD (March 2011); andPolicies SP 3 and DMH 5 of the&nbsp;Draft Local Plan 2037 Regulation 19 consultation version (December 2021)."
