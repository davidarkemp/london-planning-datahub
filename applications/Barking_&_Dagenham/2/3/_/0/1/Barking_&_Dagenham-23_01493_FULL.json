    "&lt;p&gt;The proposed development fails to comply with the requirements set out in Policy DMH5 of the draft Local Plan. Therefore, officers are unable to accept the principle of the proposed change of use. The application would result in a loss of generous family-size single dwellinghouse, which is a housing type in high demand within the Borough and of which local policies seek to preserve. The internal space of the dwelling also does not comply with the minimum requirements set out in the NDSS and London Plan to support a 5-bedroom HMO. The proposal also has the potential to increase activity level and coming and goings to and from the site as a result of unrelated individuals occupying the property, leading to additional levels of noise and disturbance that would impact the neighbours&#x27; amenity. Therefore, the negatives arising from the proposal are considered to outweigh any significant benefits as such having regard to the presumption in favour of sustainable development on balance. The principle of development is considered unacceptable and the proposed development should be refused.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;"
