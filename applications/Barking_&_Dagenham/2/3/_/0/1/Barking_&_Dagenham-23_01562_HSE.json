    "The proposed development, by reason of scale, siting, design and massing, would result in an undue loss of outlook and overbearing impact to the rear gardens of neighbouring dwellings. The proposal therefore fails to adequately protect the amenity of neighbouring occupiers, causing unacceptable harm to this. As such, the proposal is found to be at odds with the following policies which seek to ensure that residential amenity is sufficiently protected:&nbsp;\r\n National Planning Policy Framework\r\n     (NPPF) (DLUHC, 2023)\r\n Policy D6 of the London Plan (March 2021)\r\n Policies&nbsp;BP8 and BP11 of the&nbsp;Local Development\r\n     Framework (LDF) Borough Wide Development Plan Document (DPD) (March 2011)\r\n Residential Extensions and\r\n     Alterations Supplementary Planning Document (February 2012)\r\n Policies DMD1 and DMD6 of&nbsp;The London Borough of Barking\r\n     and Dagenham’s Draft Local Plan: (Regulation 19 Submission Version,\r\n     December 2021)\r\n",
