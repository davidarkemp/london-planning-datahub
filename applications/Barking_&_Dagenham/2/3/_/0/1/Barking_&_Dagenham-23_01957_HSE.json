    "The proposed development, by reason of siting, scale, design and massing, would unbalance the symmetry of the semi-detached pair, would be at odds with the surrounding pattern of development, would fail to appear subservient to the original dwelling and would substantially close off the openness of the corner plot. This would have a detrimental impact on the character and appearance of the original dwelling, semi-detached pair and surrounding area, as well as the street scene along Ottawa Gardens, Wellington Drive and Rainham Road South, causing harm to each of these. The proposal therefore fails to comply with the following policies, which when taken together seek to ensure that development proposals are well designed and have sufficient regard to the character and appearance of the surrounding area:\r\n National Planning Policy Framework&nbsp;(NPPF) (DLUHC, 2023)\r\n Policy D4 of the London Plan (March 2021)\r\n Policy CP3 of\r\n     the&nbsp;Local Development Framework Core Strategy (July 2010)\r\n Policies BP8 and BP11 of the&nbsp;Local Development Framework Borough Wide\r\n     Development Plan Document (March 2011)\r\n Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning\r\n     Document (February 2012)\r\n Policies SP2, DMD1 and DMD6 of&nbsp;The London Borough of Barking and Dagenhamâ€™s Draft\r\n     Local Plan: (Regulation 19 Submission Version, December 2021)\r\n"
