    "The proposed development, by reason of scale, bulk, siting and design, would be an undesirable addition that would disrupt the uniform building line and built form of a prominent terrace row within a Neighbourhood Centre and would appear as a bulky, discordant addition which fails to appear subordinate to the original building.&nbsp;As a result, it fails to respect or reflect the character and appearance of the original building, terrace row and wider area, causing undue harm to each of these as well as to the street scene along Reede Road. The proposal thus fails to accord with the following policies which seek to ensure that development proposals are of a high quality design which pays regard to the local character:Paragraph 130 of the National Planning Policy Framework&nbsp;National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) (DLUHC, 2021)Policy D4 of the London Plan (March 2021)Policy CP3 of the&nbsp;Local Development Framework (LDF) Core Strategy (July 2010)Policies BP11 and BE2 of the&nbsp;Local Development Framework (LDF) Borough Wide Development Plan Document (DPD) (March 2011)Policies DMD1 and SP2 of&nbsp;The London Borough of Barking and Dagenham’s Draft Local Plan: (Regulation 19 Submission Version, December 2021)"
