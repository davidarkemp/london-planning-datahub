    "&lt;p style=&quot;&quot;&gt;The mass, bulk and sitting of the proposed development would result in an increased sense of overbearing and a harmful loss of outlook and daylight to neighbouring occupiers, particularly no.177 Ilchester Road. The extension&amp;nbsp;abuts the shared boundary and the sitting of the extension creates&amp;nbsp;an overbearing impact leading to overshadowing and concerns on outlook.&amp;nbsp;The depth of the extension exceeds the distance from the corner of the adjacent property and exceeds the guided 45 degree limit leading to an unacceptable loss of light to the habitable rooms at the first floor level. The addition of the extension at the first floor level generates unneighbourly harm which reduces the openess of the terrace row.&amp;nbsp;For reasons of mass, bulk and sitting, the proposal would result in the loss of daylight and sunlight presenting overbearing and unneighbourly development which is harmful to the standard of living to no.177. This proposal therefore constitutes unneighbourly development and is contrary to the following development plans:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li style=&quot;&quot;&gt;National Planning Policy Framework National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) (DLUHC, 2023)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li style=&quot;&quot;&gt;Policy D4 of the London Plan (March 2021); - Policy CP3 of Local Development Framework (LDF) Core Strategy (July 2010)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li style=&quot;&quot;&gt;Policies BP8 and BP11 of the Local Development Framework (LDF) Borough Wide Development Plan Document (DPD) (March 2011)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li style=&quot;&quot;&gt;The Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document (February 2012)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li style=&quot;&quot;&gt;Policies SP2, DMD1 and DMD6 of The London Borough of Barking and Dagenham’s Draft Local Plan: (Regulation 19 Submission Version, December 2021)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;",
    "&lt;p style=&quot;&quot;&gt;The mass, bulk and sitting&amp;nbsp;of the proposed development would unbalance the terrace row which is constructed of symmetrical, modest-sized dwellings. The introduction of a first&amp;nbsp;floor extension would disbalance and be out-keeping with the symmetrical nature of the terrace row which is considered to be harmful to the appearance of the house, built form of the terrace and character of the area, notably given the location of the application site within the Becontree Estate. The proposed extension would increase the mass and bulk at first floor levels which is considered to be unsympathetic to the symmetry of the terrace row. As such, the proposed development is contrary to:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li style=&quot;&quot;&gt;National Planning Policy Framework National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) (DLUHC, 2023)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li style=&quot;&quot;&gt;Policy D4 of the London Plan (March 2021) - Policies CP2 and CP3 of the Local Development Framework (LDF) Core Strategy (July 2010)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li style=&quot;&quot;&gt;Policies BP2, BP8 and BP11 of the Local Development Framework (LDF) Borough Wide Development Plan Document (DPD) (March 2011)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li style=&quot;&quot;&gt;The Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document (February 2012)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li style=&quot;&quot;&gt;Policies SP2, DMD1, DMD4 and DMD6 of The London Borough of Barking and Dagenham’s Draft Local Plan: (Regulation 19 Submission Version, December 2021)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;"
