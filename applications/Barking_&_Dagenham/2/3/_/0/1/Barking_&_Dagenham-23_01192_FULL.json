    "&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:11pt&quot;&gt;Prior to commencement of the development , full details of a scheme of acoustic protection of habitable rooms against noise shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority. The scheme of acoustic protection shall be sufficient to secure internal noise levels no greater than:&lt;br&gt;a) 35 dB LAeq in living rooms and bedrooms (07:00 hours to 23:00 hours) with windows closed; and&lt;br&gt;b) 30 dB LAeq in bedrooms (23:00 hours to 07:00 hours) with windows closed.&lt;br&gt;Additionally, where the internal noise levels will exceed 40 dB LAeq in living rooms and bedrooms (07:00 hours to 23:00 hours) or 35dB LAeq in bedrooms (23:00 hours to 07:00 hours) with windows open the scheme of acoustic protection shall incorporate a ventilator system which is commensurate with the Acoustic Ventilation and Overheating Residential Design Guide January 2020.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The approved scheme shall be fully implemented before the first occupation of the residential unit to which it relates and shall be maintained at all times thereafter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

The design must consider climate change pollutants and ensure there are no trade-offs between local and global pollutant emissions. Suitable ventilation systems will need to take air from a clean location or treat the air and remove pollutants, be designed to minimise energy usage, be sufficient to prevent summer overheating and have robust arrangements for maintenance.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

The scheme must ensure that the site will not qualify as contaminated land under Part 2A of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 in relation to the intended use of the land after remediation.&lt;br&gt;c. The approved remediation scheme must be carried out in accordance with its terms prior to commencement of the development, other than that required to carry out remediation, unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority. The Local Planning Authority must be given two weeks written notification of commencement of the remediation scheme works. Following completion of measures identified in the approved remediation scheme, a verification report that demonstrates the effectiveness of the remediation carried out must be produced and is subject to the approval in writing of the Local Planning Authority. The report shall include results of sampling and monitoring carried out to demonstrate that the site remediation criteria have been met.&lt;br&gt;d. In the event that contamination is found at any time when carrying out the approved development that was not previously identified it must be reported in writing immediately to the Local Planning Authority. An investigation and risk assessment must be undertaken in accordance with the requirements of (a), and where remediation is necessary a remediation scheme must be prepared in accordance with the requirements of (b), which is subject to the approval in writing of the Local Planning Authority.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Following completion of measures identified in the approved remediation scheme a verification report must be prepared, which is subject to the approval in writing of the Local Planning Authority.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",
