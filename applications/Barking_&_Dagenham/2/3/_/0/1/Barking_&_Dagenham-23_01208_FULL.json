    "The proposal fails to provide sufficient information to enable an adequate assessment of the impact to neighbouring amenity. In particular, no information has been provided on the anticipated comings and goings of staff, residents or visitors, or the specific type of accommodation proposed. As such, the proposal may prejudice third parties who may otherwise have wished to comment on the application, the proposal cannot be accurately assessed and it cannot be demonstrated that the proposal would be supported by the development plan. As such, the proposal is at odds with the following policies, which seek to ensure that development proposals protect residential amenity:\r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\nParagraph\r\n     130 of the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) (DLUHC, September 2023); Policy\r\n     D6 of the London Plan (March 2021); Policies&amp;nbsp;BP8\r\n     and BP11 of the&amp;nbsp;Local Development Framework (LDF) Borough Wide\r\n     Development Plan Document (DPD) (March 2011); Policy DMD1 of the London Borough of Barking and Dagenham’s Draft\r\n     Local Plan 2037 (Regulation 19 Submission Version, December 2021).",
    "The proposed development would fail to provide sufficient internal space to facilitate a good quality of accommodation. Specifically, one of the proposed bedrooms would be significantly undersized, detrimental to the living conditions of future occupants. The proposal is therefore at odds with the following policies which seek to ensure that developments provide high quality living space for current and future occupiers: Paragraph 130 of the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) (DLUHC, September 2023); Policies D4 and D6 of the London Plan (March 2021); Policies CM1 and CP3 of the&amp;nbsp;Local Development Framework (LDF) Core Strategy (July 2010); Policies BP8 and BP11 of the&amp;nbsp;Local Development Framework (LDF) Borough Wide Development Plan Document (DPD) (March 2011); Policies SP3, DMD1 and SP2 of&amp;nbsp;the London Borough of Barking and Dagenham’s Draft Local Plan 2037 (Regulation 19 Submission Version, December 2021).",
    "&lt;p&gt;The proposed change of use from a single dwellinghouse (C3) to a residential institution (C2) would result in the loss of a family-sized dwellinghouse. This would be detrimental to the borough&#x27;s stock of family-sized dwellinghouses, the need for which is set out in the development plan and supporting evidence. Though policies also support the provision of specialist housing, there must be an identified need, which has not been evidenced in the application. As such, the proposal would conflict with the following policies which seek to ensure that the borough&#x27;s housing supply meets the needs of its residents: Chapters 5 and 8 of the National Planning Policy Framework&amp;nbsp; (NPPF) (DLUHC, September 2023);&amp;nbsp; Policies S2, H10 and H12 of\r\n     the London Plan (March 2021);&amp;nbsp; Policy CC1 of the&amp;nbsp;Local Development Framework (LDF) Core Strategy\r\n     (July 2010);&amp;nbsp; Policy BC4 of the&amp;nbsp;Local Development Framework (LDF) Borough Wide\r\n     Development Plan Document (DPD) (March 2011);&amp;nbsp; Policy SP3 of the London Borough of Barking and Dagenham’s Draft\r\n     Local Plan 2037 (Regulation 19 Submission Version, December 2021).&lt;/p&gt;"
