    "The proposed development, by reason of siting, scale, mass and design, would be an undesirable addition which would introduce a discordant roof form, would not be well-proportioned, would not provide functional additional space to the first floor and would appear at odds with the established local character. It would therefore fail to respect or reflect the existing character and to preserve or enhance the local distinctiveness of the Becontree Estate, causing harm to each of these. The proposal therefore fails to accord with the following policies:\r\n National Planning Policy Framework&nbsp;(NPPF) (DLUHC, 2023)Policies D1, D4 and HC1 of the London Plan (March 2021)Policies CP2 and CP3 of\r\n     the&nbsp;Local Development Framework Core Strategy (July 2010)Policies BP2 and BP11 of the&nbsp;Local Development Framework Borough Wide\r\n     Development Plan Document (March 2011)Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning\r\n     Document (February 2012)Policies SP2, DMD1, DMD4 and DMD6 of&nbsp;The London Borough of Barking and Dagenhamâ€™s Draft\r\n     Local Plan: (Regulation 19 Submission Version, December 2021)\r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n"
