    "<p>The proposal, especially the proposed side extension, by reason of bulk, scale and siting, would be an undesirable addition, which would disrupt the symmetry of the semi-detached unit. It also would close off the openness of the corner plot. As a result, it fails to respect or reflect the character of the original dwelling, semi-detached unit and surrounding area, and fails to respect, preserve or enhance the local distinctiveness of the Becontree Estate. The proposal is thus contrary to the following policies which seek to ensure that development is of a high quality, respectful to local character and appearance, and sympathetic to the historic character: </p><p>- National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) (DLUHC, 2023); </p><p>- Policies D1/8 &amp; HC1 of the London Plan (March 2021); </p><p>- Policies CP2/3 &amp; CR2 of the Local Development Framework (LDF) Core Strategy (July 2010); </p><p>- Policies BP2/11 of the Local Development Framework (LDF) Borough Wide Development Plan Document (DPD) (March 2011); </p><p>- Policies SPP6 &amp; DMD1/4/6 of the London Borough of Barking and Dagenham’s Draft Local Plan: (Regulation 19 Submission Version, December 2021); and </p><p>- The London Borough of Barking and Dagenham’s Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document (February 2012)<br></p>"
