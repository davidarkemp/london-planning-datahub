    "The proposed development, by reason of design, fails to demonstrate clear, separate and functional access to each dwelling.&nbsp;This would result in harm&nbsp;to the quality of accommodation provided for future occupants and to the street scene. As such, the proposal fails to comply with the following policies which seek to ensure that design is of a high quality and that new developments have appropriate access arrangements:Paragraphs 110, 112 and 130 of the&nbsp;National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) (DLUHC, 2021)Policy D5 of the London Plan (March 2021)Policy CP3 of the&nbsp;Local Development Framework (LDF) Core Strategy (July 2010)Policies BP8 , BP11 and&nbsp;BR11 of the&nbsp;Local Development Framework (LDF) Borough Wide Development Plan Document (DPD) (March 2011)Policies SP2 and SP8 of&nbsp;The London Borough of Barking and Dagenham’s Draft Local Plan: (Regulation 19 Submission Version, December 2021)Housing Supplementary Planning Guidance (Mayor of London, 2016)",
    "&lt;p&gt;The proposed one-bedroom dwelling, by reason of scale and design, would fail to meet the nationally described space standards, would be too narrow to provide functional habitable space and would have poor levels of daylight and sunlight. As such, it would fail to provide an acceptable quality of accommodation, causing harm to the living standards of future occupants. The proposal is thus considered to be at odds with the following policies which support development that provides high-quality accommodation and living conditions:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;National\r\nPlanning Policy Framework (NPPF)\r\n(DLUHC, 2021)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Policies D4 and D6 of the London Plan (March 2021)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Policies CM1 and CP3 of the LDF Core Strategy (July 2010)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Policies BP8 and BP11 of the LDF Borough Wide Development Plan Document DPD (March 2011)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Policies SP3, DMD1 and SP2 of the Draft Local Plan (Regulation 19 Submission Version, December 2021)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:11pt&quot;&gt;Housing Design Standards London Plan Guidance (GLA, June 2023)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",
    "&lt;p&gt;The proposed development, by reason of siting, scale and design, would fail to appear as two separate dwellinghouses with equal presence within the street scene. This would result in an unbalancing of the uniformity of the street and would be detrimental to the character and appearance of the street scene, host dwelling, terrace row and wider Becontree Estate. The proposal therefore constitutes uncharacteristic and unsympathetic development, contrary to the following policies which seek to ensure that development proposals are well designed and pay regard to local character:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;National Planning Policy Framework (MHCLG, July 2021)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Policies D4 and HC1 of the London Plan (March 2021)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Policies CP2 and CP3 of the Core Strategy DPD (July 2010)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Policies BP2, BP8 and BP11 of the Borough Wide DPD (March 2011)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Policies SP2, DMD1 and DMD4 of the Draft Local Plan Regulation 19 consultation version (Regulation 19 Submission Version, December 2021)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Extensions and Alterations (February 2012)&lt;/p&gt;"
