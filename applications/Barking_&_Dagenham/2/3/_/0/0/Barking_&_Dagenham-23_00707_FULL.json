    "&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:11pt&quot;&gt;The proposal failed to provide a transport statement, therefore an accurate assessment of the proposed development on&amp;nbsp;neighbouring properties, parking and highways was not completed due to the lack of information. Despite this,&amp;nbsp;the proposed building would present implementing an industrial storage unit, only accessible from a single-track, narrow road inadequate for large vehicles and no turning points. &lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;As such, the proposed development is considered unacceptable, contrary to: -&amp;nbsp;The National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) (2021)Policies T3 and T5 of the London Plan (March 2021)Polices BR10 and BR11 of the Borough Wide DPD (2011)Policy CM1 of the Core Strategy DPD (July 2010)Policy DMT1 of the Draft Local Plan Regulation 19 consultation version (2021)",
    "The size and scale of the building, with a depth of over 17 metres abutting the North site boundary, would result in a &#39;penned-in&#39; and overbearing impact on no.4 Lancaster Avenue. Whilst it is acknowledged a lack of detail was submitted indicating the details of the business therefore a thorough assessment of the impacts of noise, waste and general disturbances was not able to be carried out, new non-residential self-contained unit into a primarily residential area, to the rear of dwellinghouses would be detrimental to the amenity of surrounding neighbouring dwellings. As such, this is deemed as unacceptable and contrary to:-&nbsp;The National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) (2021)Policies GG1, GG3, D14 of the London Plan (March 2021)Policies BP8 of the Borough Wide DPD (2011)Policies DMD1 and Policy DMSI3 of the Draft Local Plan Regulation 19 consultation version (2021)",
    "The proposal seeks permission for the construction of a building for use in Class B8 on a residential plot. For reasons of scale, size and design, the storage unit would be disproportionally large compared to ancillary outbuildings along the rest of Lancaster Road, closing off the openness to the rear and is considered to overdevelop the plot, detrimental to the character of the area. As such, the proposed development is unacceptable, contrary to:-The National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) (2021)Policies D1, D4 AND D8 os the London Plan (March 2021)Policy CP3 of the Core Strategy DPD (July 2010)Policy BP11 of the Borough Wide DPD (2011)Policies SP2, SP7, DMD1, DMSI1 and DMSI2 of the Draft Local Plan Regulation 19 consultation version (2021)",
    "The proposal seeks permission for the construction of a new B8 use building on land to the rear of 2 Lancaster Avenue which is not located within an industrially safeguarded site but within a residential setting. On this basis the principle of development is deemed as unacceptable contrary to:-Chapter 4 of the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) (2021)Policies GG5, E4 and E7 of the London Plan (March 2021)Policy CE3 and Paragraph 3.4 of the Core Strategy DPD (July 2010)Paragraphs 3.8 and 3.9 of the Draft Local Plan Regulation 19 consultation version (2021)"
