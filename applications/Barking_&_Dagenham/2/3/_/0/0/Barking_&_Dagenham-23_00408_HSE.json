    "&lt;p&gt;The proposed hip to gable roof extension by reason if its excessive size, scale, cumulative bulk and design\r\nwould result in the loss of distinctive hipped roof profile, resulting in overly dominant roof form that would unbalance the existing building and a group of terrace houses it forms a part of.&amp;nbsp; The addition of rear dormer would further exacerbate the impact of the hip to gable roof extension. The proposal as such would detract from, and thus fail to preserve, the\r\ncharacter and appearance of the Becontree Estate which is a non-designated heritage asset.&amp;nbsp;As such, the proposal fails to accord with the following policies:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Paragraphs 126, 130 and 134 of the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) (DLUHC, 2021);&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Policies D4 and HC1 of the&amp;nbsp;London Plan (March 2021);&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Policies CP2 and CP3 of the Local Development Framework (LDF) Core Strategy (July 2010);&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Policies BP2 and BP11 of the Local Development Framework (LDF) Borough Wide Development Plan Document (DPD) (March 2011);&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Policies SP2, DMD1, DMD4 and DMD6 of the London Borough of Barking and Dagenhamâ€™s Draft Local Plan 2037 (Regulation 19 Submission Version, December 2021);&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Section 5.6.3 of the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document (February 2012).&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;"
