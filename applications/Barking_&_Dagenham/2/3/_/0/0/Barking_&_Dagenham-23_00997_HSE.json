    "\r\n The proposal, by reason of siting and scale, would be an\r\n     undesirable addition which would cause unacceptable overshadowing, loss of\r\n     daylight and outlook and an overbearing impact to neighbouring dwellings.\r\n     This would result in a harmful impact to the amenity currently enjoyed by\r\n     neighbouring occupiers and as such constitutes un-neighbourly development. The proposal thus fails to\r\n     accord with the following policies which seek to ensure that development\r\n     proposals protect residential amenity:\r\n The National Planning Policy\r\n     Framework&nbsp;National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) (DLUHC, 2021)\r\n Policy D6 of the London Plan (March 2021)\r\n Policies&nbsp;BP8 and BP11 of the&nbsp;Local Development\r\n     Framework (LDF) Borough Wide Development Plan Document (DPD) (March 2011)\r\n The Residential Extensions and\r\n     Alterations Supplementary Planning Document (February 2012)\r\n Policies DMD1 and DMD6 of&nbsp;The London Borough of Barking\r\n     and Dagenham’s Draft Local Plan: (Regulation 19 Submission Version,\r\n     December 2021)\r\n",
    "The proposal, by reason of bulk, scale, design and siting,&nbsp; would disrupt the built form, symmetry and rhythm of the terrace row, materially alter the character of the roofscape, fail to reflect the appearance of the existing front elevation, appear excessively bulky to the rear, fail to appear subordinate to the original dwelling and would have an overly complex composite roofscape. As such, it would fail to respect or reflect the character and appearance of the original dwelling, terrace row and wider area, causing harm to each of these. Additional weight is given to this harm given the siting within and impact to the Becontree Estate, a non-designated heritage asset. The proposal would thus fail to accord with the following policies which seek to ensure that development proposals are of a high quality design, accord with local character and appearance and protect or enhance the local distinctiveness of heritage assets:\r\n The National Planning Policy Framework&nbsp;National Planning\r\n     Policy Framework (NPPF) (DLUHC, 2021)\r\n Policies D4 and HC1 of\r\n     the London Plan (March 2021)\r\n Policies\r\n     CP2 and CP3 of the&nbsp;Local Development Framework (LDF) Core Strategy\r\n     (July 2010)\r\n Policies&nbsp;BP8\r\n     and BP11 of the&nbsp;Local Development Framework (LDF) Borough Wide\r\n     Development Plan Document (DPD) (March 2011)\r\n The Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary\r\n     Planning Document (February 2012)\r\n Policies\r\n     SP2, DMD4 and DMD6 of&nbsp;The London Borough of Barking and Dagenham’s Draft\r\n     Local Plan: (Regulation 19 Submission Version, December 2021)\r\n"
