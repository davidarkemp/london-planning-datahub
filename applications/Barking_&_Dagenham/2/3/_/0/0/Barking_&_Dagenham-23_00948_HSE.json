    "&lt;p&gt;The development exacerbates the shortfall of car\r\nparking, as it does not provide adequate parking for the number of residents\r\nthe property would support. This is contrary to Policy BR9 ‘Parking’ of the\r\nBorough Wide Policies Development Plan Document (Adopted March 2011).&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",
    "&lt;p&gt;The principle of introducing a self-contained outbuilding of&amp;nbsp;primary residential use within the garden setting of no.4 is not supported. The proposal therefore represents an&amp;nbsp;inappropriate and uncharacteristic residential form in a rear garden setting&amp;nbsp;which results in harm to the occupiers of the main dwelling at no.4. As such, the proposal is contrary to:&amp;nbsp; -National Planning Policy Framework (&lt;span class=&quot;scayt-misspell-word&quot; data-scayt-word=&quot;MHCLG&quot; data-wsc-lang=&quot;en_US&quot; data-wsc-id=&quot;lhz0kdr4bpyd8g0s5&quot; style=&quot;&quot;&gt;MHCLG&lt;/span&gt;, February 2019); -Policies D1, D4 and D6 of the London Plan (March 2021);&amp;nbsp;Policy CP3 of the&amp;nbsp;Local Development Framework Core Strategy (July 2010);&amp;nbsp;- Policies BP8 and BP11 of the LDF Borough Wide Development Plan Policies DPD (March 2011);- Policies SP2,&amp;nbsp; SP4, DMD1 and DMD6 of the Draft Local Plan (Regulation 19 Consultation Version, October 2020); - The Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document (February 2012)&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",
    "&lt;p&gt;On account of its scale and siting&amp;nbsp;within a rear garden setting, the proposed development is at odds with the surrounding pattern of development and results in harm to neighbouring occupiers through the&amp;nbsp;additional generation of noise, waste, smoke, fumes and comings and goings.&amp;nbsp;The development would therefore constitute&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class=&quot;scayt-misspell-word&quot; data-scayt-word=&quot;unneighbourly&quot; data-wsc-lang=&quot;en_US&quot; data-wsc-id=&quot;lhz0ke344usir6h42&quot;&gt;unneighbourly&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;development and is contrary to: -National Planning Policy Framework National Planning Policy Framework (&lt;span class=&quot;scayt-misspell-word&quot; data-scayt-word=&quot;NPPF&quot; data-wsc-lang=&quot;en_US&quot; data-wsc-id=&quot;lhz0ke33x8grdt8d5&quot;&gt;NPPF&lt;/span&gt;) (&lt;span class=&quot;scayt-misspell-word&quot; data-scayt-word=&quot;DLUHC&quot; data-wsc-lang=&quot;en_US&quot; data-wsc-id=&quot;lhz0ke32ja7dozdb0&quot;&gt;DLUHC&lt;/span&gt;, 2021); - Policies D1 and D4 of the London Plan (March 2021);&amp;nbsp; - Policy CP3 of Local Development Framework (LDF) Core Strategy (July 2010);&amp;nbsp; - Policies BP8 and BP11 of the Local Development Framework (LDF) Borough Wide Development Plan Document (DPD) (March 2011);&amp;nbsp; - Policies SP2, DMD1 and DMD6 of The London Borough of Barking and Dagenham’s Draft Local Plan: (Regulation 19 Submission Version, December 2021); - The Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document (February 2012)&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br style=&quot;background-color: rgb(229, 229, 229);&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;"
