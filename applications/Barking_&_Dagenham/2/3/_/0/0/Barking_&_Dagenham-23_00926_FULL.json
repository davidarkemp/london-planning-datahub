    "&lt;p&gt;The proposal is for the construction of a rear access staircase to the first floor accommodation, removing the internal staircase.&amp;nbsp;This will&amp;nbsp;promote&amp;nbsp;an unsafe entrance to the existing flat, which is not accessible from the street but an unlit, service road.&amp;nbsp;As such, this will constitute inappropriate and poorly designed development which is detrimental to the safety and standard of accommodation for residents and the amenity of neighbouring properties.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The proposal is therefore contrary to:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Paragraph 130 of the National Planning Policy Framework (DLUHC, July&amp;nbsp;2021)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Policies D4, D6, and D11 of the London Plan (March 2021)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Policy CP3 of the&amp;nbsp;Local Development Framework (LDF) Core Strategy (July 2010)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Policies BC7, BP8, and BP11 of the&amp;nbsp;Local Development Framework (LDF) Borough Wide Development Plan Document (DPD) (March 2011)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Policies DMD1 and DMD6 of the&amp;nbsp;the London Borough of Barking and Dagenham’s Draft Local Plan 2037&amp;nbsp;(Regulation 19 Submission Version, December 2021)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Section 3 - Part B of the Housing Design London Plan Guidance (June 2023)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;",
    "&lt;p&gt;The design and layout of the proposed flat would introduce a narrow kitchen, with no windows, therefore would receive&amp;nbsp;near to no natural daylight and would be unable to ventilate cooking odours efficiently or prevent overheating. As such, this represents poor quality design, unacceptable for the proposed use, contrary to:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Policy D6 of the London Plan (March 2021)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Part C2.5 of the&amp;nbsp;The Housing Design Standards London Planning Guidance (June 2023)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;",
    "&lt;p&gt;The design and siting of the proposed first storey rear extension and proposed staircase would result the construction of a platform structure which is out if character and at odds with the appearance of the area. It would also result in a detrimental loss of privacy and overlooking into habitable rooms of&amp;nbsp;neighbouring dwellings, especially causing harm for the accommodation above no.347&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11pt;&quot;&gt;Ripple Road&lt;/span&gt;.&amp;nbsp; The proposal is therefore contrary to:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Paragraph 130 of the National Planning Policy Framework (DLUHC, July&amp;nbsp;2021)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Policies D4 and D6 of the London Plan (March 2021)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Policy CP3 of the&amp;nbsp;Local Development Framework (LDF) Core Strategy (July 2010)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Policies BP8 and BP11 of the Local Development Framework (LDF) Borough Wide Development Plan Document (DPD) (March 2011)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Policies DMD1 and DMD6 of the London Borough of Barking and Dagenham’s Draft Local Plan 2037&amp;nbsp;(Regulation 19 Submission Version, December 2021)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Section 3 - Part B of the Housing Design London Plan Guidance (June 2023)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;"
