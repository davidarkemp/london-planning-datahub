    "The\r\nproposed extension, by reason of siting and design, would be an\r\nundesirable addition which would remove a distinctive feature from the front elevation, which currently contributes positively to the character of the Becontree Estate and to the rhythm and symmetry of the terrace row. As such, it would fail to respect or reflect the character and appearance of the original dwelling, terrace row, street scene along Valence Wood Road and wider Becontree Estate, causing harm to each of these as well as to the local distinctiveness and historic character of the Becontree Estate. The proposal is thus contrary to\r\nthe following policies which seek to ensure that developments are sympathetic to\r\nlocal character and history:\r\n\r\n\r\n Paragraph\r\n     130&nbsp;of the National Planning Policy Framework&nbsp;National Planning\r\n     Policy Framework (NPPF) (DLUHC, 2021)\r\n Policies\r\n     D4 and HC1 of the London Plan (March 2021)\r\n Policies\r\n     CP2 and CP3 of the&nbsp;Local Development Framework (LDF) Core Strategy\r\n     (July 2010)\r\n Policies\r\n     BP2, BP8 and BP11 of the&nbsp;Local Development Framework (LDF) Borough\r\n     Wide Development Plan Document (DPD) (March 2011)\r\n The Residential Extensions and Alterations\r\n     Supplementary Planning Document (February 2012)\r\n Policies\r\n     SP2, DMD4 and DMD6 of&nbsp;The London Borough of Barking and Dagenhamâ€™s\r\n     Draft Local Plan: (Regulation 19 Submission Version, December 2021)\r\n"
