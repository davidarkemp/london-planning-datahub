    "The\r\nproposal, by reason of siting, scale, bulk and design, would be an\r\nundesirable addition which would disrupt the well-preserved roof form of the dwelling, terrace row and wider estate and would appear unduly dominant when compared with the original dwelling. As such, it fails to respect or reflect the character of the original\r\ndwelling, the terrace row of which it forms a part, and the surrounding area,\r\ncausing harm to each of these as well as to the street scene along Blessing Way.&nbsp;The proposal thus fails to accord with the\r\nfollowing policies which seek to ensure development proposals are well\r\ndesigned and respect and reflect the existing character:\r\n\r\n\r\n Paragraph\r\n     130 of the National Planning Policy Framework&nbsp;National Planning\r\n     Policy Framework (NPPF) (DLUHC, 2021)\r\n Policy&nbsp;D4&nbsp;of\r\n     the London Plan (March 2021)\r\n Policies\r\n     CP2 and CP3 of the&nbsp;Local Development Framework (LDF) Core Strategy\r\n     (July 2010)\r\n Policies&nbsp;BP8\r\n     and BP11 of the&nbsp;Local Development Framework (LDF) Borough Wide\r\n     Development Plan Document (DPD) (March 2011)\r\n The Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary\r\n     Planning Document (February 2012)\r\n Policies\r\n     SP2 and DMD6 of&nbsp;The London Borough of Barking and Dagenhamâ€™s Draft\r\n     Local Plan: (Regulation 19 Submission Version, December 2021)\r\n"
