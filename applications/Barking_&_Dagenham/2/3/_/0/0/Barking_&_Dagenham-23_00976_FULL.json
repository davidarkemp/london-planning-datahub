    "&lt;p&gt;The proposed development would prejudice the strategic planned comprehensive redevelopment at the application site and the wider area which falls within the River Road Employment Area and its surrounding sites. As such, the proposed development will impinge the Council&#x27;s ability to meet its local industrial and housing need for the period of the draft Local Plan 2037 (Regulation 19 submission version, December 2021), contrary to draft policies SPDG1 and SPP2, and contrary to London Plan policies E5 and E7. The proposed development therefore would prevent sustainable and strategically planned development from coming forward, contrary to the NPPF.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",
