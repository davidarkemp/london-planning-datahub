    "\r\n The proposal, by reason of siting and scale, would be an\r\n     undesirable addition which would cause unacceptable overshadowing, loss of\r\n     daylight and outlook and an overbearing impact to neighbouring dwellings.\r\n     This would result in a harmful impact to the amenity currently enjoyed by\r\n     neighbouring occupiers. As such, it fails to protect residential amenity\r\n     and constitutes un-neighbourly development.
