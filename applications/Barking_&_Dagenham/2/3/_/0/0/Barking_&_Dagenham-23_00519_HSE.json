    "&lt;p&gt;The proposed development, by reason of its width, scale, massing, and positioning right up to the boundary with the neighbouring property would close the characteristic gap between the&amp;nbsp;properties at first floor level which currently distinguishes between the two semi-detached pairs.&amp;nbsp;The proposal is therefore considered to fail to respect the character and appearance of the surrounding area as this is a characteristic feature within the Becontree Estate non-designated heritage asset that creates softness against the built form. As such, the proposed development is contrary to:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Paragraphs 130 and 134 of the National Planning Policy Framework National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) (DLUHC, July 2021);&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Policies D4&amp;nbsp;and HC1 of the London Plan (March 2021);&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Policies CP2 and CP3 of the Local Development Framework (LDF) Core Strategy (July 2010); &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Policies BP2 and BP11 of the Local Development Framework (LDF) Borough Wide Development Plan Document (DPD) (March 2011);&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Policies SP2, DMD1, DMD4 and DMD6 of The London Borough of Barking and Dagenhamâ€™s Draft Local Plan 2037 (Regulation 19 Submission Version, December 2021); and&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Paragraphs 5.4.2 and 5.4.3 of The Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document (February 2012).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;"
