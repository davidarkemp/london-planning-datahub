    "&lt;p&gt;The proposal, by reason of&amp;nbsp;siting and scale, would be an undesirable addition which would cause unacceptable overshadowing, loss of privacy&amp;nbsp;and an overbearing impact to neighbouring dwellings. This would result in a harmful impact to the amenity currently enjoyed by neighbouring occupiers. As such, it fails to protect residential amenity and constitutes un-neighbourly development. The proposal thus fails to accord with the following policies which seek to ensure that development proposals protect residential amenity:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;Paragraph 130 of the National Planning Policy Framework&amp;nbsp;National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) (DLUHC, 2021)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Policy D6 of the London Plan (March 2021)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Policies&amp;nbsp;BP8 and BP11 of the&amp;nbsp;Local Development Framework (LDF) Borough Wide Development Plan Document (DPD) (March 2011)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sections 4.2&amp;nbsp;and 5.3 of the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document (February 2012)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Policies DMD1 and DMD6 of&amp;nbsp;The London Borough of Barking and Dagenham’s Draft Local Plan: (Regulation 19 Submission Version, December 2021)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;",
    "&lt;p&gt;The proposal, by reason of siting, design, scale and bulk, would be an undesirable addition which would not appear subservient to the original dwelling, would unbalance the symmetry across the&amp;nbsp;terrace row and&amp;nbsp;entrance to Amidas Gardens,&amp;nbsp;would close off the openness of the corner plot and&amp;nbsp;would disrupt the built form of a banjo cul-de-sac. As a result, it fails to respect or reflect the character of the original dwelling, terrace row and surrounding area, and&amp;nbsp;fails to respect, preserve or enhance the local distinctiveness of the Becontree Estate.&amp;nbsp;It would have a harmful impact on each of these, as well as on the street scene along Marlborough Road and Amidas Gardens.&amp;nbsp;The proposal is thus contrary to the following policies which seek to ensure that development is of a high quality, has regard to local character and appearance and is sympathetic to the historic character:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;Paragraph 130 of the National Planning Policy Framework&amp;nbsp;National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) (DLUHC, 2021)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Policy D1, D4 and HC1 of the London Plan (March 2021)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Policies CP2 and CP3 of the&amp;nbsp;Local Development Framework (LDF) Core Strategy (July 2010)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Policies BP2, BP8 and BP11 of the&amp;nbsp;Local Development Framework (LDF) Borough Wide Development Plan Document (DPD) (March 2011)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sections 4.1 and 5.4 of the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document (February 2012)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Policies SP2, DMD4&amp;nbsp;and DMD6 of&amp;nbsp;The London Borough of Barking and Dagenham’s Draft Local Plan: (Regulation 19 Submission Version, December 2021)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;"
