    "\r\n The proposal, by reason of siting and scale, would be an\r\n     undesirable addition which would cause unacceptable overshadowing, loss of\r\n     daylight and outlook and an overbearing impact to neighbouring dwellings.\r\n     This would result in a harmful impact to the amenity currently enjoyed by\r\n     neighbouring occupiers. As such, it fails to protect residential amenity\r\n     and constitutes un-neighbourly development. The proposal thus fails to\r\n     accord with the following policies which seek to ensure that development\r\n     proposals protect residential amenity:Paragraph 130 of the National Planning Policy\r\n     Framework&nbsp;National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) (DLUHC, 2021)Policy D6 of the London Plan (March 2021)Policies&nbsp;BP8 and BP11 of the&nbsp;Local Development\r\n     Framework (LDF) Borough Wide Development Plan Document (DPD) (March 2011)Sections 4.2&nbsp;and 5.3 of the Residential Extensions and\r\n     Alterations Supplementary Planning Document (February 2012)Policies DMD1 and DMD6 of&nbsp;The London Borough of Barking\r\n     and Dagenham’s Draft Local Plan: (Regulation 19 Submission Version,\r\n     December 2021)\r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n",
    "The\r\nproposal, by reason of siting, scale, bulk and design, would be an\r\nundesirable addition which would fail to appear subservient to the original dwelling, would sit uncomfortably alongside the original extension and would feature an unsympathetic roof form. As such, it fails to respect or reflect the character of the original\r\ndwelling, the terrace row of which it forms a part, and the surrounding area,\r\ncausing harm to each of these. The proposal thus fails to accord with the\r\nfollowing policies which seek to ensure development proposals are well\r\ndesigned and accord with the local character:\r\n\r\n\r\n Paragraph\r\n     130 of the National Planning Policy Framework&nbsp;National Planning\r\n     Policy Framework (NPPF) (DLUHC, 2021)\r\n Policy&nbsp;D4&nbsp;of\r\n     the London Plan (March 2021)\r\n Policies\r\n     CP2 and CP3 of the&nbsp;Local Development Framework (LDF) Core Strategy\r\n     (July 2010)\r\n Policies&nbsp;BP8\r\n     and BP11 of the&nbsp;Local Development Framework (LDF) Borough Wide\r\n     Development Plan Document (DPD) (March 2011)\r\n Sections\r\n     4.1 and 5.3 of the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary\r\n     Planning Document (February 2012)\r\n Policies\r\n     SP2 and DMD6 of&nbsp;The London Borough of Barking and Dagenham’s Draft\r\n     Local Plan: (Regulation 19 Submission Version, December 2021)\r\n"
