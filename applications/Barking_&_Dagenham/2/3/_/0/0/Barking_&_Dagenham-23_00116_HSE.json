    "&lt;p&gt;The proposal, by reason of siting, scale, bulk and design, would be an undesirable addition which would form an overdevelopment of the site, result in a loss of symmetry across the semi detached pair,&amp;nbsp;would not appear subservient to the original dwelling and would be at odds with the design and built form of Lindsey Road. It also fails to respect, preserve or enhance the local distinctiveness of the Becontree Estate.&amp;nbsp;As such, the proposal fails to respect or reflect the character of the host dwelling, semi detached pair&amp;nbsp;and surrounding area, resulting in a harmful impact to each of these,&amp;nbsp;as well as to&amp;nbsp;the street scene along Lindsey Road.&amp;nbsp;Further, it would have a detrimental impact on the character of the Becontree Estate. The proposed extension thus fails to accord with the following policies which seek to ensure good design which respects and reflects the character of the local area and is sympathetic to local character and history:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paragraph 130 of the National Planning Policy Framework&amp;nbsp;National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) (DLUHC, 2021)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Policies D4 and HC1 of the London Plan (March 2021)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Policies CP2 and CP3 of the&amp;nbsp;Local Development Framework (LDF) Core Strategy (July 2010)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Policies BP2, BP8 and BP11 of the&amp;nbsp;Local Development Framework (LDF) Borough Wide Development Plan Document (DPD) (March 2011)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sections 4.1 and 5.4&amp;nbsp;of the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document (February 2012)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Policies SP2, DMD4 and DMD6 of&amp;nbsp;The London Borough of Barking and Dagenhamâ€™s Draft Local Plan: (Regulation 19 Submission Version, December 2021)&lt;/p&gt;"
