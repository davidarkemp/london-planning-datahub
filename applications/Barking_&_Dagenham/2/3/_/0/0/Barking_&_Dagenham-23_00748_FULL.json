    "In the absence of a noise impact assessment, it cannot be established that the proposed educational use would achieve suitable environment for the intended use. The proposal would therefore be contrary to:Policies D13 (Agent of Change) and D14 (Noise) of the London Plan (March 2021),Policy BR13 (Noise mitigation) of the Borough Wide Development Plan Document (March 2011), andPolicy DMSI 3 (Nuisance) of the LBBD Draft Local Plan 2037, Reg 19 (Autumn 2021).",
    "The proposed change of use from ancillary offices serving a warehouse building to education in a designated Locally Significant Industrial Sites (LSIS) cannot be supported because the applicant failed to demonstrate that the proposed co-location would not compromise the wider LSIS in terms of its continued efficient function, access, service arrangements and days/hours of operation. It also was not demonstrated that the loss of the ancillary office space would not have a negative impact on the viability of the existing warehouse building. The proposed development is therefore contrary to:Policies E6 (Locally Significant Industrial Sites) and E7 (Industrial Intensification, co- Location, and substitution) of the London Plan (March 2021),Policy CE3 (Safeguarding and release of employment land) of the Core Strategy (July 2010),Strategic Policy SP5 (Promoting inclusive economic growth) and Policy DME 1 (Utilising the borough’s employment land more efficiently) of the LBBD Draft Local Plan 2037, Reg 19 (Autumn 2021)."
