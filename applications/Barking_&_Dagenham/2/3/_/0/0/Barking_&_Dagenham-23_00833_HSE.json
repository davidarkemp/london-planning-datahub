    "&lt;p style=&quot;&quot;&gt;The proposed development&amp;nbsp;would introduce significant architectural bulk and massing at roof level&amp;nbsp;which would result in a development that materially harms the architectural integrity, unity, and established roofscapes of the dwellinghouses along Hunters Square where the roofscapes are unified and distinctive in form.&amp;nbsp;The proposal as such would detract from, and thus fail to preserve, the character and appearance of the&amp;nbsp;Becontree Estate which is a non-designated heritage asset.&amp;nbsp;The proposed development is contrary to:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Paragraphs 130, 134, and 203 of the National Planning Policy Framework (MHCLG, July 2021);&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Policies D4 and&amp;nbsp;HC1 of The London Plan (March 2021);&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Policy CP2 and CP3 of the LDF Core Strategy (July 2010);&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Policy BP2 and BP11 of the LDF Borough Wide Development Plan Policies DPD (March 2011);&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Policies SP2, DMD4, DMD1 and DMD6 of the Draft Local Plan (Regulation 19 Consultation version, October 2020); and&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Paragraph 5.6.3 of the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document (February 2012).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;"
