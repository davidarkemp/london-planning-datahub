    "&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:11pt&quot;&gt;The applicant has failed to submit archaeological information, investigation or studies with this proposal which is sited&amp;nbsp;within an&amp;nbsp;Archaeological Priority Area. As such, the proposal is contrary to: - National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) (DLUHC, 2021); - Policy HC1 of the London Plan (March 2021); - Policy CP2 of the&amp;nbsp;Local Development Framework Core Strategy (July 2010); - Policy&amp;nbsp;BP2 of the Borough Wide DPD (March 2011); - Policy DMD4 of the Draft Local Plan&amp;nbsp;(Regulation 19 Submission Version, December 2021).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",
    "&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The applicant has failed to present plans which accurately depict the site and proposed development.&amp;nbsp;Specifically,&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;inaccurate details&amp;nbsp;to the roof and internal layout have been identified, and the submitted Daylight and Sunlight Assessment is insufficiently detailed.&lt;span style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;No existing floorplans, elevations or sections have been submitted.&amp;nbsp;The proposal could prejudice third parties who may otherwise have wished to comment on the application; the proposed development cannot be accurately assessed and it cannot be demonstrated that it would be supported by the Development Plan. As such, the proposed development is contrary to:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;- National Planning Policy Framework&amp;nbsp;National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) (DLUHC, 2021);&amp;nbsp;- Policy D4 of the London Plan (March 2021); - Policy CP3 of the&amp;nbsp;Local Development Framework (LDF) Core Strategy (July 2010);&amp;nbsp;- Policies BP8 and BP11 of the&amp;nbsp;Local Development Framework (LDF) Borough Wide Development Plan Document (DPD) (March 2011); - Policies SP2 and DMD1 of&amp;nbsp;The London Borough of Barking and Dagenhamâ€™s Draft Local Plan: (Regulation 19 Submission Version, December 2021).&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",
    "&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:11pt&quot;&gt;The applicant has failed to provide sufficient information to demonstrate that the proposal would not result in undue harm to neighbouring amenities in terms of daylight/sunlight, outlook and&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:11pt&quot;&gt;privacy to neighbouring properties. The proposal&amp;nbsp;would constitute an unneighbourly form of development, contrary to&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:11pt&quot;&gt;: - National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) (DLUHC, 2021); - Policy D4 of the London Plan (March 2021); - Policy CP3 of the&amp;nbsp;Local Development Framework Core Strategy (July 2010); - Policies&amp;nbsp;BP8 and BP11 of the Borough Wide DPD (March 2011);&amp;nbsp;- Policies SP2 and DMD1&amp;nbsp;of the Draft Local Plan&amp;nbsp;(Regulation 19 Submission Version, December 2021).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",
    "&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:11pt&quot;&gt;The proposed development, by reason of its bulk, height, massing, design and materiality, fails to respond to the constraints of the application site and character/appearance of the surrounding area. The north-facing fenestration also finishes on the boundary with the neighbouring site which is inappropriate and inhibits the future development of that site.&amp;nbsp;Insufficient justification has been provided for the proposed design, which is considered to be of poor quality and&amp;nbsp;to detract from the historic setting.&lt;span style=&quot;text-align:justify&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;This impact is particularly&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-align:justify&quot;&gt;notable given the site is within the &lt;/span&gt;Abbey and Barking Town Centre Conservation Area, within the&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style=&quot;text-align:justify&quot;&gt;setting of a locally listed building and a Grade II listed building, within the setting of a scheduled ancient monument and&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-align:justify&quot;&gt;within the area of protected local views&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-align:justify&quot;&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;The development is considered to constitute less than substantial harm to the heritage assets, which is&amp;nbsp;not outweighed by the public benefits derived from the scheme.&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style=&quot;text-align:justify&quot;&gt;The proposal is unacceptable and contrary to:&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;- National Planning Policy Framework (&lt;span style=&quot;text-align:justify&quot;&gt;DLUHC&lt;/span&gt;, 2021); - Policies&amp;nbsp;D1, D4, D8 and HC1 of the&amp;nbsp;London Plan (March 2021); - Policies CP2 and&amp;nbsp;CP3&amp;nbsp;of the Core Strategy DPD (July 2010); -&amp;nbsp;Policies BP2 and&amp;nbsp;BP11 of the Borough Wide DPD (March 2011); - Policies&amp;nbsp;SP2, DMD5, DMD1 and DMD4 of the Draft Local Plan (Regulation 19 Submission Version, December 2021); -Policy BTC16 and BTC19 of the Barking Town Centre Area Action Plan (February 2011).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",
    "&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:11pt&quot;&gt;The proposed development would provide poor outlook, a poor access arrangement, and poor&amp;nbsp;quality external amenity space for future occupiers (particularly&amp;nbsp;noting the lack of&amp;nbsp;privacy to the ground floor garden). No information has been submitted to demonstrate daylight/sunlight levels for future occupiers, which is of concern given the site constraints.&amp;nbsp;As such, the proposed development introduces sub-standard accommodation that would&amp;nbsp;not facilitate an acceptable living standard for future occupiers.&amp;nbsp;The proposed development is therefore contrary to: - National Planning Policy Framework (DLUHC, 2021); - Policies D4 and D6 of the London Plan (March 2021); - Policies CP3 and CC1 of the LDF Core Strategy (July 2010); - Policies BP5, BP8 and BP11 of the LDF Borough Wide Development Plan Policies DPD (March 2011); - Policies SP2, SP3 and DMD1 of the Draft Local Plan (Regulation 19 Submission version, December 2021).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",
    "&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:11pt&quot;&gt;The applicant&amp;nbsp;has failed to adequately justify the reduction in public house floorspace at the site or provide any details of the operational arrangements of the future use in the absence of this service yard area. As such, it has not been demonstrated that the loss of&amp;nbsp;floorspace&amp;nbsp;would not&amp;nbsp;compromise the operation or viability of the existing public house use, noting the loss of a large area of the pub&#x27;s back-of-house area.&amp;nbsp;In the absence of such information, the proposed development is considered to result in the loss of a community asset which&amp;nbsp;forms&amp;nbsp;part of&amp;nbsp;the area&#x27;s&amp;nbsp;social infrastructure.&amp;nbsp;As such, the proposed development is contrary to:&amp;nbsp;National Planning Policy Framework (MHCLG, July 2021);&amp;nbsp;Policy HC7, SD6, S1, GG1 of the London Plan (July 2021); Policies CM1, CC2, CM5, CP2 of the LDF Core Strategy (July 2010); Policies BC6, BP1, BE4, BE2 of the LDF Borough Wide Development Plan Policies DPD (March 2011); Policies DMS3, SP4, DME3 of the Draft Local Plan&amp;nbsp;(Regulation 19 Submission Version, December 2021); and&amp;nbsp;Supplementary Planning Document (SPD) Last Orders?
