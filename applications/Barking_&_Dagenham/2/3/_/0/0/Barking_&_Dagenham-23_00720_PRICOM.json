    "The proposed monopole and cabinets by reason of its visual prominence, height, appearance and siting would result in dominant addition to the streetscene, would fail to respond to positive aspects of the surrounding area and the setting of nearby designated heritage asset. Consequently, the proposed development would cause less than substantial harm to the significance of the designated heritage asset. As such the proposal would result in unacceptable visual clutter. The proposed development would, therefore, conflict with policies:Policies D4, SI6, and HC1 of the London Plan (March 2021); Policy CP3 of the Core Strategy (July 2010);Policies BC12, BP3, BP8,&nbsp; BP11 of the Borough Wide Development Policies DPD (March 2011); andPolicies SP 2 DMD 1, DMD 4, and Policy DMSI 9 of the LBBD draft Local Plan 2037 (Autumn 2021).",
