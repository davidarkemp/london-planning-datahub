    "&lt;p&gt;The proposal, by reason of mass, bulk, scale and siting, would be an undesirable addition which would have an unacceptable overbearing impact on and cause material overshadowing to 391&amp;nbsp;Ivyhouse Road. This would result in a harmful impact to the amenity enjoyed by the occupants of 391 Ivyhouse Road. As such, the proposal constitutes unneighbourly development and is thus contrary to the following policies which seek to ensure that developments do not materially harm the amenity of neighbouring residents:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Paragraph 130&amp;nbsp;of the National Planning Policy Framework&amp;nbsp;National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) (DLUHC, 2021)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Policy D6&amp;nbsp;of the London Plan (March 2021)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Policies&amp;nbsp;BP8 and BP11 of the&amp;nbsp;Local Development Framework (LDF) Borough Wide Development Plan Document (DPD) (March 2011)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Section&amp;nbsp;4.1 of the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document (February 2012)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Policies DMD1&amp;nbsp;and DMD6 of&amp;nbsp;The London Borough of Barking and Dagenham’s Draft Local Plan: (Regulation 19 Submission Version, December 2021)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;",
    "The proposed extension, by reason of mass, bulk, scale and siting, would be an undesirable addition which&amp;nbsp;would: appear overly dominant when combined with the existing extensions;&amp;nbsp;fail&amp;nbsp;to appear subservient to the original dwelling due to its excessive depth; and fail&amp;nbsp;to respect, preserve or enhance the local distinctiveness of the Becontree Estate. As such, the proposal fails to respect and reflect the character of&amp;nbsp;the original dwelling, terrace row, banjo cul de sac and wider local area (Becontree Estate), resulting&amp;nbsp;in a harmful impact on the character of each of these. The proposal thus fails to accord with the following policies which seek to ensure&amp;nbsp;good design which respects and reflects the character of the local area and is sympathetic to local character and history:&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Paragraph 130 of the National Planning Policy Framework&amp;nbsp;National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) (DLUHC, 2021)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Policies D4 and HC1 of the London Plan (March 2021)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Policies CP2 and CP3 of the&amp;nbsp;Local Development Framework (LDF) Core Strategy (July 2010)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Policies BP2, BP8 and BP11 of the&amp;nbsp;Local Development Framework (LDF) Borough Wide Development Plan Document (DPD) (March 2011)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sections 4.1 and 5.6&amp;nbsp;of the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document (February 2012)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Policies SP2, DMD4 and DMD6 of&amp;nbsp;The London Borough of Barking and Dagenham’s Draft Local Plan: (Regulation 19 Submission Version, December 2021)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;"
