    "&lt;p&gt;The proposed extension, by reason of scale, bulk, siting and design, would be an undesirable addition that would result in a loss of symmetry across the entrance to the banjo and across the terrace row, a significant addition of bulk that would not appear subordinate to the original dwelling and a material change to the characteristic roofscape. It also fails to respect, preserve or enhance the local distinctiveness of the Becontree Estate, particularly given its impact on a characteristic banjo cul-de-sac. As such, the proposal fails to respect or reflect the character of the host dwelling, terrace row and surrounding area, resulting in a harmful impact to each of these,&amp;nbsp;as well as to&amp;nbsp;the street scene along Marlborough Road and Dorothy Garden and the&amp;nbsp;character and appearance of the banjo cul-de-sac.&amp;nbsp; Further, it would have a detrimental impact on the character of the Becontree Estate. The proposed extension thus fails to accord with the following policies which seek to ensure good design which respects and reflects the character of the local area and is sympathetic to local character and history:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Paragraph 130 of the National Planning Policy Framework&amp;nbsp;National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) (DLUHC, 2021)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Policies D4 and HC1 of the London Plan (March 2021)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Policies CP2 and CP3 of the&amp;nbsp;Local Development Framework (LDF) Core Strategy (July 2010)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Policies BP2, BP8 and BP11 of the&amp;nbsp;Local Development Framework (LDF) Borough Wide Development Plan Document (DPD) (March 2011)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sections 4.1 and 5.6&amp;nbsp;of the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document (February 2012)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Policies SP2, DMD4 and DMD6 of&amp;nbsp;The London Borough of Barking and Dagenhamâ€™s Draft Local Plan: (Regulation 19 Submission Version, December 2021)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;"
