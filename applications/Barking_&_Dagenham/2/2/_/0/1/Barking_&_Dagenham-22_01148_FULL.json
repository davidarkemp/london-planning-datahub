    "&lt;p&gt;The proposal has provided limited details as to how residents will be taken to and from the site and the total number of people including visitors that will be present at any given time. As these users will rely on on-street parking due to the lack of information a full assessment cannot be carried out as to what impact the proposal will have on the highway or local parking amenity. Consequently, this matter is considered unacceptable and contrary to:-&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",
    "&lt;p&gt;The change of use from a dwelling to care home is considered to result in the generation of more waste, noise, coming and goings and general disturbances than a single dwellinghouse. Considering the lack of information provided with the application regarding parking, shift patterns etc, officers are not satisfied that the proposal would have a negligible impact upon neighbouring amenity. The proposal is therefore considered unacceptable and contrary to:-&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",
    "&lt;p&gt;The proposed change of use from a single dwellinghouse (C3) to a children care home (C2) would represent the loss of a family sized dwellinghouse within the Borough. Whilst policies also seek to ensure the provision of specialist housing the applicant has failed to provide substantial evidence which suggests there is an identified need in the Borough and at this location. Therefore, on balance officers consider the loss of a family sized dwelling which is the type of housing this Borough seeks to preserve to outweigh the need for more specialist housing. The proposal is therefore contrary to:-&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;"
