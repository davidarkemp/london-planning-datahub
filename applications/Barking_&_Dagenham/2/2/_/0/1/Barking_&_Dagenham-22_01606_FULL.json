The proposed development, by reason of the change of use to a HMO, would result in the loss of a family sized dwelling which is a priority house type within the Borough.&amp;nbsp;Therefore the negatives arising from the provision of a house of multiple occupancy are considered to outweigh any significant benefits, having regard to the presumption in favour of sustainable development.

This is considered to have a negative impact on neighbouring amenity and in turn the health and wellbeing of neighbouring residents. As such the proposal is contrary to the Policies DMD 1, SP 7 and DMSI 3 of the Draft Local Plan, and Policies BP8 and BP11 of the Local Development Framework Borough Wide Development Plan.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;"
