    "&lt;p&gt;The proposed extension, by reason of scale, bulk, siting and design, would be an undesirable addition which would unbalance the symmetry of the terrace row and surrounding dwellings, reduce the openness of the corner plot and fail to appear subservient to the original dwelling. In addition, the design of the proposed roofscape is incongruent with the roofscape of the terrace of which it forms a part and with the surrounding area.&amp;nbsp; As such, the proposal fails to respect or reflect the character of the host dwelling, terrace row and surrounding area, resulting in a harmful impact to each of these, as well as having a detrimental impact on the street scene. The proposed extension thus fails to accord with the following policies which seek to ensure good design which respects and reflects the character of the local area:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paragraph 130 of the National Planning Policy Framework&amp;nbsp;National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) (DLUHC, 2021)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Policy D4 of the London Plan (March 2021)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Policies CP2 and CP3 of the&amp;nbsp;Local Development Framework (LDF) Core Strategy (July 2010)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Policies&amp;nbsp;BP8 and BP11 of the&amp;nbsp;Local Development Framework (LDF) Borough Wide Development Plan Document (DPD) (March 2011)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sections 4.1 and 5.4 of the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document (February 2012)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Policies SP2 and DMD6 of&amp;nbsp;The London Borough of Barking and Dagenham’s Draft Local Plan: (Regulation 19 Submission Version, December 2021)&lt;/p&gt;",
    "&lt;p&gt;The proposal, by reason of siting, scale and design, would result in an unacceptable overbearing impact on and loss of privacy to 146 Dagenham Avenue. As such, it would have a harmful impact on the amenity currently enjoyed by the occupants of 146 Dagenham Avenue, and constitutes unneighbourly development. This is contrary to the following policies which seek to ensure that developments do not materially harm the amenity of neighbouring residents:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paragraph 130&amp;nbsp;of the National Planning Policy Framework&amp;nbsp;National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) (DLUHC, 2021)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Policy D6&amp;nbsp;of the London Plan (March 2021)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Policies&amp;nbsp;BP8 and BP11 of the&amp;nbsp;Local Development Framework (LDF) Borough Wide Development Plan Document (DPD) (March 2011)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Section&amp;nbsp;4.1 of the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document (February 2012)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Policies DMD1&amp;nbsp;and DMD6 of&amp;nbsp;The London Borough of Barking and Dagenham’s Draft Local Plan: (Regulation 19 Submission Version, December 2021)&lt;/p&gt;",
