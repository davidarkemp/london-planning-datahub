  "description": "I would like to build a conservatory from the back of the house into the garden. I would like to make it at at the width of the house and to come out by 6 meters. We really need this space as our kitchen is extremely small and the dining table is crammed in the living room where my husband sleeps as he is disabled so he struggles using the stairs and needs quick access to the toilet which is downstairs as he canât control his bowels.",
