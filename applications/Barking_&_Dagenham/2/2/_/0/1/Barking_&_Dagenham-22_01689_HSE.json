    "&lt;div&gt;The proposed development, by reason of siting and design, would be an undesirable addition which would materially alter the roofscape and result in a loss of symmetry with number 1a, a disruption of the rhythm of the street and a loss of uniformity in the built form of the terrace row. This would have a harmful impact on the original dwelling, the symmetrical pair, the terrace row and the wider area. As such, the proposal fails to respect and reflect the character of the area, and thus fails to accord with the following policies which seek to ensure that proposals are well designed and respect and reflect the character of the area:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paragraph 130 of the National Planning Policy Framework&amp;nbsp;National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) (DLUHC, 2021)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Policy D4 of the London Plan (March 2021)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Policies CP2 and CP3 of the&amp;nbsp;Local Development Framework (LDF) Core Strategy (July 2010)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Policies&amp;nbsp;BP8 and BP11 of the&amp;nbsp;Local Development Framework (LDF) Borough Wide Development Plan Document (DPD) (March 2011)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Section 4.1 of the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document (February 2012)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Policies SP2 and DMD6 of&amp;nbsp;The London Borough of Barking and Dagenhamâ€™s Draft Local Plan: (Regulation 19 Submission Version, December 2021)&lt;/p&gt;"
