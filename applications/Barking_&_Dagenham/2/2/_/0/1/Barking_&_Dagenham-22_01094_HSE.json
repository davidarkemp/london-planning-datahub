    "&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;The proposed introduction of an outbuilding with a basement in the rear garden of the site would represent a discordant and\r\nincongruous feature which is out of character with the properties along the street scene. The proposed extent of development is considered to lead itself to forming a part of the primary accommodation onsite, rather than merely incidental use to the dwelling. For the reasons above, officers consider the proposed outbuilding and basement to be inappropriate in design and scale, and thus the proposal would not be ancillary to the use of the main dwellinghouse. As such the proposal is contrary to the following:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-&amp;nbsp;National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) (DLUHC, 2021);&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Policies D1 and D4 of the London Plan (March 2021);&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;- Policy CP3 of the&amp;nbsp;Local Development Framework (LDF) Core Strategy (July 2010);&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Policy BP11 of the&amp;nbsp;Local Development Framework (LDF) Borough Wide Development Plan Document (DPD) (March 2011);&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Policies SP2, DMD1 and DMD6 of The London Borough of Barking and Dagenhamâ€™s Draft Local Plan: (Regulation 19 Submission Version, December 2021);&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-&amp;nbsp;Residential Extensions and Alterations (SPD) (February 2012)&lt;/p&gt;"
