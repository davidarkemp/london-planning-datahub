    "&lt;p&gt;The&amp;nbsp;proposed extension, by reason of&amp;nbsp;siting and design, would be an undesirable addition which fails to respect, preserve or enhance the local distinctiveness of the Becontree Estate. This would have a detrimental&amp;nbsp;impact on the character of the Becontree Estate, contrary to the following policies which aim to ensure developments are sympathetic to local character and history:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paragraph 130&amp;nbsp;of the National Planning Policy Framework&amp;nbsp;National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) (DLUHC, 2021)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Policies D4 and HC1 of the London Plan (March 2021)Policies CP2 and CP3 of the&amp;nbsp;Local Development Framework (LDF) Core Strategy (July 2010)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Policies BP2, BP8 and BP11 of the&amp;nbsp;Local Development Framework (LDF) Borough Wide Development Plan Document (DPD) (March 2011)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sections 4.1 and 5.6.3&amp;nbsp;of the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document (February 2012)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Policies SP2, DMD4 and DMD6 of&amp;nbsp;The London Borough of Barking and Dagenham’s Draft Local Plan: (Regulation 19 Submission Version, December 2021)&lt;/p&gt;",
    "&lt;p&gt;The proposal, by reason of siting and design, would be an undesirable addition which would unbalance the symmetry of the terrace row, detract from the characteristic roofscape of the dwelling, terrace and street, partially close off a positive gap between dwellings&amp;nbsp;and presents a discordant feature which appears at odds with the character of the dwelling, terrace row and&amp;nbsp;area. As such, the proposal fails to respect or reflect the character of the host dwelling, terrace row and surrounding area, resulting in a harmful impact on each of these and a detrimental impact on the street scene along Crossway.&amp;nbsp;The proposed extension thus fails to accord with the following policies which seek to ensure good design which respects and reflects the character of the local area:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paragraph 130 of the National Planning Policy Framework&amp;nbsp;National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) (DLUHC, 2021)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Policy D4 of the London Plan (March 2021)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Policies CP2 and CP3 of the&amp;nbsp;Local Development Framework (LDF) Core Strategy (July 2010)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Policies&amp;nbsp;BP8 and BP11 of the&amp;nbsp;Local Development Framework (LDF) Borough Wide Development Plan Document (DPD) (March 2011)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sections 4.1 and 5.4 of the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document (February 2012)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Policies SP2 and DMD6 of&amp;nbsp;The London Borough of Barking and Dagenham’s Draft Local Plan: (Regulation 19 Submission Version, December 2021)&lt;/p&gt;"
