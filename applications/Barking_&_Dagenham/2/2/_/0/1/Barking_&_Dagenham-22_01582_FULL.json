    "\r\n Construction Method\r\n     Statement/Management Plan\r\n&nbsp;Prior to commencement of development a\r\nConstruction Method Statement (CMS) shall be submitted to and approved in\r\nwriting by the Local Planning Authority. The CMS shall include details of: &nbsp;a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe\r\nlocation of identification markers to the National Grid pipelines for the\r\nextent of the proximity zones and set up crossing points where necessary. Any\r\nworks carried out within the proximity zones will be in line with national grid\r\nguidance SSW22 and under National Grid supervision.b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nA\r\nformalised process for design and construction methodology agreed in conjunction\r\nwith the National Grid and HSE. c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nSite\r\nrisk assessments to include details of the gas services and signage to be\r\nprovided at key locations. d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nDetails\r\nof ground vibration monitoring where the peak particle velocity is predicted to\r\nexceed 50 mm/sec.&nbsp;The development shall be carried out in\r\naccordance with the relevant approved CMS which shall be retained for the\r\nduration of the construction process.&nbsp;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReason: To ensure that the construction does not\r\nimpact underground infrastructure.

    "\r\n Unidentified Contamination\r\n&nbsp;In the event that contamination is found at any\r\ntime when carrying out the approved development that was not previously\r\nidentified it must be reported in writing immediately to the Local Planning\r\nAuthority. An investigation and risk assessment must be undertaken in\r\naccordance with the following requirements: &nbsp;a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nan\r\ninvestigation and risk assessment, in addition to any assessment provided with\r\nthe planning application, shall be completed in accordance with a scheme to\r\nassess the nature and extent of any contamination on the site, whether or not\r\nit originates on the site. The contents of the scheme are subject to the\r\napproval in writing of the Local Planning Authority. The investigation and risk\r\nassessment must be undertaken by competent persons and a written report of the\r\nfindings must be produced. The written report is subject to the approval in\r\nwriting of the Local Planning Authority. The report of the findings must\r\ninclude:(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\na\r\nsurvey of the extent, scale and nature of contamination; (ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nan\r\nassessment of the potential risks to human health; property (existing or\r\nproposed) including buildings, crops, livestock, pets, woodland and service\r\nlines and pipes; adjoining land; groundwaters and surface waters; ecological\r\nsystems; archaeological sites and ancient monuments; and (iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nan\r\nappraisal of remedial options, and proposal of the preferred option(s). This\r\nmust be conducted in accordance with DEFRA and the Environment Agency’s ‘Model\r\nProcedures for the Management of Land Contamination, CLR 11. Where remediation\r\nis necessary the following will be required: b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\na\r\ndetailed remediation scheme, to bring the site to a condition suitable for the\r\nintended use by removing unacceptable risks to human health, buildings and\r\nother property and the natural and historical environment, shall be prepared\r\nand submitted to the Local Planning Authority for approval in writing. The\r\nscheme must include all works to be undertaken, proposed remediation objectives\r\nand remediation criteria, timetable of works and site management procedures.\r\nThe scheme must ensure that the site will not qualify as contaminated land\r\nunder Part 2A of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 in relation to the\r\nintended use of the land after remediation.c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nFollowing\r\ncompletion of the measures identified in the approved remediation scheme a\r\nverification report must be prepared, which is subject to the approval in\r\nwriting of the Local Planning Authority. &nbsp;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReason: Contamination must be identified prior\r\nto commencement of development to ensure that risks from land contamination to\r\nthe future users of the land and neighbouring land are minimised, together with\r\nthose to controlled waters, property and ecological systems, and to ensure that\r\nthe development can be carried out safely without unacceptable risks to\r\nworkers, neighbours and other off-site receptors in accordance with policy BR5\r\nof the Borough Wide Development Policies",
    "\r\n Construction Logistics Plan\r\n&nbsp;Prior to commencement of development a\r\nConstruction Logistics Plan (CLP) shall be submitted to and approved in writing\r\nby the Local Planning Authority.

Subsequently these approved parking areas shall be\r\nmarked out and visible for use. The approved construction staff travel plan\r\nmeasures shall be put in place prior to commencement of the Plot, retained and\r\ncontinually monitored for the duration of these works; (j)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nany other matters relevant to this particular Plot\r\nincluding liaising with developers and construction teams of neighbouring\r\nsites, in order to identify and address potential cumulative highway effects\r\nduring the demolition and construction phase. &nbsp;The development shall be carried out in\r\naccordance with the relevant approved CLP. The CLP shall periodically be\r\nreviewed following audits of its implementation. Results of these audits will\r\nbe made available to the Council upon request. The CLP shall be retained for\r\nthe duration of the construction process.&nbsp;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReason: To ensure that the construction does\r\nnot prejudice the ability of neighbouring occupier’s reasonable enjoyment of\r\ntheir properties. It is necessary for this condition to prevent the\r\ncommencement of development until the requirements of the condition have been\r\nmet because the timing of compliance is fundamental to the decision to grant\r\nplanning permission.",
