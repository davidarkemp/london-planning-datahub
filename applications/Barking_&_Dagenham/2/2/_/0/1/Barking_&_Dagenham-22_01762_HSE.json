    "&lt;div&gt;The bulk, mass, size, siting and design of the proposed rear extension would result in an overbearing, harmful impact on neighbouring dwellings nos.95b and 97 Stanley Avenue due to the excessive depth of the proposal, creating a sense of enclosure. This would likely result in no.95b to experience an increased loss of daylight and overshadowing especially within the garden. This proposal therefore constitutes an unneighbourly development and contrary to: The National Planning Policy Framework (DLUHC, 2021), Policy D4 of the London Plan (2021), policies CP2 and CP3 of the Local LDF Core Strategy (2010), policies BP2, BP8 and BP11 of the LDF Borough Wide DPD (2011), The Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD (2012), and policies SP2, DMD1, DMD4 and DMD6 of The LBBD Draft Local Plan (2021).&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;",
    "&lt;div&gt;The bulk, mass, size, siting and design of the proposed rear extension would be disproportionately large compared to the original modest-sized, detached dwelling and is considered harmful to the character and appearance of the property as it would almost double in square footage.&amp;nbsp; As such, the proposed development is contrary to:&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11pt;&quot;&gt;The National Planning Policy Framework (DLUHC, 2021), Policy D4 of the London Plan (2021), policies CP2 and CP3 of the Local LDF Core Strategy (2010), policies BP2, BP8 and BP11 of the LDF Borough Wide DPD (2011), The Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD (2012), and policies SP2, DMD1, DMD4 and DMD6 of The LBBD Draft Local Plan (2021).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;"
