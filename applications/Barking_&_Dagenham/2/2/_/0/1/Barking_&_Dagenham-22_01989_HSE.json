    "&lt;p&gt;The proposal, by reason of scale, siting and design, would be an undesirable addition which would close the gap between the terraces to a significant extent, would increase the sense of enclosure for users of the alleyway and would disguise the bay window on the front elevation. As such, the proposal fails to respect or reflect the character of the original house, the terrace row of which it forms a part and the wider local area, causing harm to each of these as well as the street scene along Rose Glen. Further, the proposal fails to protect and causes harm to the amenity of users of the alleyway. The proposed extension thus fails to accord with the following policies which seek to ensure good design which respects and reflects the character of the local area and protects amenity:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paragraph 130 of the National Planning Policy Framework&amp;nbsp;National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) (DLUHC, 2021)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Policy D4 of the London Plan (March 2021)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Policies CP2 and CP3 of the&amp;nbsp;Local Development Framework (LDF) Core Strategy (July 2010)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Policies&amp;nbsp;BP8 and BP11 of the&amp;nbsp;Local Development Framework (LDF) Borough Wide Development Plan Document (DPD) (March 2011)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sections 4.1, 4.2, 5.2&amp;nbsp;and 5.4 of the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document (February 2012)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Policies SP2, DMD1 and DMD6 of&amp;nbsp;The London Borough of Barking and Dagenhamâ€™s Draft Local Plan: (Regulation 19 Submission Version, December 2021)&lt;/p&gt;"
