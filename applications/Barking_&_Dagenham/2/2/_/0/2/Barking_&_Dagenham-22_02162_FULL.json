    "The proposed dwellinghouse, for reasons of design and siting, would result in the loss of two off-street parking spaces, which due to the low PTAL of the site and the CPZ would result in a significant pressure on on-street parking and would be inpracticle for furture residents. As such the proposal is considered unacceptable and contrary to:-National Planning Policy Framework (MHCLG, February 2019)Policies T.61 and T5 of the London Plan (2021)Policies BR9, BR10 and BR11 of the Borough Wide DPD (March 2011)Policies DMT 2 and DMT3 of the Draft Local Plan Regulation 19 consultation version (2021)",
    "The proposed dwellinghouse for reasons of design, size and siting, would result in a significant loss of daylight, outlook, privacy, whilst also resulting in unacceptable levels of overshadowing and would be very overbearing for neighbouring dwellings espcially number 24 Marsh Green Road. Further, the proposal will double the the number of households on site, significantly increasing the number of occupants using the site. As such, given the sites location sandwiched between existing dwellings, the proposal is considered to generate more waste, light, noise, comings and goings and general disturbances than currently produced on site. The proposal is therefore considered to have an unacceptable impact on neighbouring amenity harmful to the standard of living of surrounding residents. The proposal is considered unacceptable and contrary to:-National Planning Policy Framework (MHCLG, February 2019)Policies GG1, GG3 and D14 of the&nbsp; London Plan (March 2021)Policy BP8 of the Borough Wide DPD (March 2011)Policies DMD1 and DMSI3 of the Draft Local Plan Regulation 19 consultation version (2021)",
    "The proposed dwellinghouse for reasoning of bulk, mass, size, scale and design would constitute an unfavourable addition to the existing dwellinghouse, appearing cramped and subservient akin to a side extension rather than its own individual dwellinghouse. To further this, the design of the gabled roof would fail to reflect that of the existing dwelling or reflect the singular roofcape of the terrace row, thus appearing discordant and out of place, whilst the flat roof of the double storey rear and the massing of the three storey appearance of the rear elevation illutsrate poor design uncharacteristic of the existing property. Further, for reasons of siting and size, the proposal would result in a significant loss of the openness of the plot, creating a harsh built form and increased sense of enclosure. The proposal is therefore considered an uncharacteristic and unsympathetic addition to the dwelling detrimental to the property, terrace row and the surrounding local area. The proposal is considered unacceptable and contrary to:-National Planning Policy Framework (MHCLG, February 2019)Policies D1, D4 and&nbsp; D8 of the London Plan (March 2021)Policy CP2 of the Core Strategy DPD (July 2010)Policy&nbsp; BP11 of the Borough Wide DPD (March 2011)Policies SP2, SP4 and DMD1 of the Draft Local Plan Regulation 19 consultation version (2021)"
