    "&lt;p&gt;3. Notwithstanding reason for refusal 1, the proposed development, by reason of the inappropriate access arrangement, fails to present a safe or appropriate access route for future occupants. The arrangement would require future residential occupiers to access their property via a commercial service yard which is unlit and does not provide meaningful separation from the proposed residential units, which is deemed inappropriate and unsafe. The proposed development is therefore contrary to:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;National Planning Policy Framework National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(DLUHC, 2021); - Policies D4, D6, D11 and D6 of the London Plan (March 2021)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Policy CP3 of the LDF Core Strategy (July2010)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Policies BP8 and BP11 of the Local Development Framework (LDF) Borough Wide Development Plan Document (DPD)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(March 2011)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Policy DMD1, SP2 and SP3 of The London Borough of Barking and Dagenham’s Draft Local Plan (Regulation 19&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Submission Version, December 2021)&lt;/p&gt;",
    "&lt;p&gt;1. The applicant has failed to present plans which accurately depict the development on site. Specifically, the position of the proposed staircase in relation to the existing existing ground floor development is not consistent between the proposed plans and elevations submitted. In addition, it is not evident how the existing flat provides habitable accommodation with no independent kitchen, and access to a kitchen only being via the staff room at ground floor level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The proposal could prejudice third parties who may otherwise have wished to comment on the application; the proposed development cannot be accurately assessed, and it cannot be demonstrated that it would be supported by the Development Plan.
