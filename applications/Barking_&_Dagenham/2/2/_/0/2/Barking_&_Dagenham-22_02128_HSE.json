    "<div>By reason of design, the proposed front, infill extension would be an undesirable addition to the dwellinghouse removing a key characteristic, the shared, arched recessed porch. This is considered harmful to the appearance and character of the house, the symmetry of the terrace row and the regularity of the repetitive streetscene, notably given the location of the application site within the Becontree Estate. As such, the proposed development is contrary to:&nbsp;The National Planning Policy Framework (DLUHC, 2021), Policy D4 of the London Plan (2021), policies CP2 and CP3 of the Local LDF Core Strategy (2010), policies BP2, BP8 and BP11 of the LDF Borough Wide DPD (2011), The Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD (2012), Housing Design Quality and Standards SPG (2020) and policies SP2, DMD1, DMD4 and DMD6 of&nbsp; The LBBD Draft Local Plan (Regulation 19 Submission Version, 2021).</div><div><br></div>"
