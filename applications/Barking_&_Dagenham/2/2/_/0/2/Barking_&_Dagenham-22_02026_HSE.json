    "&lt;p&gt;The proposal, by reason of siting, scale, mass, bulk and design, would be an undesirable addition which would unbalance the symmetry of the terrace row, would not appear subservient to the original dwelling, would present a significant addition of mass in combination with the existing extensions, would reduce the openness of the entry to the park and would introduce a new incongruent feature to the front elevation. As such, it fails to respect and reflect the character of the original dwelling, terrace row and wider area, causing harm to each of these. It also fails to preserve or enhance the local distinctiveness of the Becontree Estate, causing harm to the historic character of this area. The proposal thus fails to accord with the following policies which seek to ensure that development proposals are well designed and are sympathetic to local character and history:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paragraph 130 of the National Planning Policy Framework National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) (DLUHC, 2021)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Policies D4 and HC1 of the London Plan (March 2021)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Policies CP2 and CP3 of the Local Development Framework (LDF) Core Strategy (July 2010)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Policies BP2, BP8 and BP11 of the Local Development Framework (LDF) Borough Wide Development Plan Document (DPD) (March 2011)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sections 4.1, 5.3 and 5.4&amp;nbsp;of the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document (February 2012)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Policies SP2, DMD4 and DMD6 of The London Borough of Barking and Dagenhamâ€™s Draft Local Plan: (Regulation 19 Submission Version, December 2021)&lt;/p&gt;"
