    "&lt;div&gt;The bulk, mass, size, siting and design of the proposed development would result in an increased sense of enclosure causing a harmful loss of outlook and daylight to neighbouring occupiers especially no.142 Arden Crescent, therefore constituting an overbearing and unneighbourly development and contrary to:&amp;nbsp;National Planning Policy Framework National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) (DLUHC, 2021), Policy D4 of the London Plan (March 2021), Policy CP3 of Local Development Framework (LDF) Core Strategy (July 2010), Policies BP8 and BP11 of the Local Development Framework (LDF) Borough Wide Development Plan Document (DPD) (March 2011), The Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document (February 2012), Policies SP2, DMD1 and DMD6 of The London Borough of Barking and Dagenhamâ€™s Draft Local Plan: (Regulation 19 Submission Version, December 2021).&lt;/div&gt;",
    "&lt;div&gt;The bulk, mass,&amp;nbsp; size, siting and design of the proposed development would appear disproportionately large compared to the original modest-sized dwellinghouse, harmful to the appearance of the house, built form of the symmetrical terrace row and character of the area, notably given the location of the application site within the Becontree Estate, whilst removing almost all private amenity space on the site.
