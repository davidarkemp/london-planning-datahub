    "&lt;p&gt;The proposal, by reason of siting, design, scale, mass and bulk, would be an undesirable addition which disrupts the rhythm of the terrace row, removes a key characteristic feature from&amp;nbsp;the front elevation and wider Becontree Estate,&amp;nbsp;does not appear subservient to the original dwelling and is discordant&amp;nbsp;with the dwelling and terrace row. As such, it fails to respect or reflect the character of the original dwelling, terrace row of which it forms a part, and wider Becontree Estate, causing harm to the character of each of these. It further fails to preserve or enhance the local distinctiveness of the Becontree Estate, causing harm to the historic character of this area. As such, the proposal fails to comply with the following policies which seeks to ensure that development proposals are well designed, respect and reflect the existing character and are sympathetic to local character and history:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paragraph 130 of the National Planning Policy Framework National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) (DLUHC, 2021)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Policies&amp;nbsp;D4 and HC1 of the London Plan (March 2021)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Policies CP2 and CP3 of the Local Development Framework (LDF) Core Strategy (July 2010)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Policies BP2, BP8 and BP11 of the Local Development Framework (LDF) Borough Wide Development Plan Document (DPD) (March 2011)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sections 4.1, 5.1 and 5.2&amp;nbsp;of the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document (February 2012)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Policies SP2, DMD4 and DMD6 of The London Borough of Barking and Dagenhamâ€™s Draft Local Plan: (Regulation 19 Submission Version, December 2021)&lt;/p&gt;"
