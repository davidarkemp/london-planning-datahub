    "&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:11pt&quot;&gt;The outbuilding, by reason of siting, scale, mass and design, is an undesirable addition which is overly dominant in the rear garden setting, constitutes overdevelopment of the plot in combination with existing extensions and fails to appear subservient to the original dwelling.
