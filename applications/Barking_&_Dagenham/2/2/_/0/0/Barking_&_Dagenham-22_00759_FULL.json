    "&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;The proposed change of use to Airbnb has potential to increase activity levels and coming and goings to and from the site leading to additional levels of noise and disturbance at the property. This is considered to have a negative impact on neighbouring amenity and in turn the health and wellbeing of neighbouring residents. As such the proposal is contrary to:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) (DLUHC, 2021);&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Policies BP8 and BP11 of the Borough Wide DPD (March 2011);&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Policies DMD 1, SP 7 and DMSI 3 of The London Borough of Barking and Dagenham’s Draft Local Plan: (Regulation 19 Submission Version, December 2021)&lt;/p&gt;",
    "&lt;p&gt;The proposed development, by reason of its location does not sit within a focused town centres or identified centres, which is close to transport hubs and other facilities. Therefore the proposed development is considered a non conforming use within this location which is contrary to the following policies:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Policy E10 of the&amp;nbsp;London Plan (March 2021);&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Policy CP1 of the&amp;nbsp;Local Development Framework (LDF) Core Strategy (July 2010);&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Policy BP1 of the&amp;nbsp;Local Development Framework (LDF) Borough Wide Development Plan Document (DPD) (March 2011);&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Policy DME 4 of The London Borough of Barking and Dagenham’s Draft Local Plan: (Regulation 19 Submission Version, December 2021)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",
    "&lt;p&gt;The proposal will result in the loss of a 4+ bedroom family sized dwelling, a type of housing in extremely high demand within the Borough. Therefore the negatives arising from the proposal are considered to outweigh any significant benefits as such having regard to the presumption in favour of sustainable development on balance the principle of development is considered unacceptable and contrary to:-&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) (DLUHC, 2021);&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Policy H10 of the London Plan (March 2021);&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Policies CM1, and CC1 of the Core Strategy DPD (July 2010);&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Policy BC4 of the Borough Wide DPD (March 2011);&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Policies SPDG1, SP3 of The London Borough of Barking and Dagenham’s Draft Local Plan: (Regulation 19 Submission Version, December 2021);&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Housing Supplementary Planning Guidance (GLA, March 2016, Updated August 2017);&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- London Borough of Barking and Dagenham Housing Delivery Test Action Plan 2020&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;"
