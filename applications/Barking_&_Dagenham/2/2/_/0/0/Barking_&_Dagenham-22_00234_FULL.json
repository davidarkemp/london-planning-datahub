Furthermore, e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:11pt&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;line-height:115%&quot;&gt;mergency vehicle access will also be restricted through the current shared access.

    "&lt;p&gt;The proposed development for reasons of design, size, and sitting would result in unacceptable levels of overshadowing and material loss of outlook . The proposal therefore constitutes overbearing and unneighbourly development detrimental to the standard of living of residents of nos 79 and 81 Surrey Road. Further, the proposal will result in the number of households onsite by 2 and the number of residents by 8.&amp;nbsp; As such, given the sites location within the rear garden the proposal is considered to generate more waste, light, noise, comings and goings and general disturbances than currently produced on site. The proposal is therefore considered to have an unacceptable impact on neighbouring amenity harmful to the standard of living of surrounding residents. The proposal is considered unacceptable and contrary to the development policies.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;",
    "&lt;p&gt;The proposed development for reasons of sitting would constitute backland development as it would sit to the rear of the properties along Surrey Road and fails to have a presence from the street scene.&amp;nbsp; The proposal therefore appears out of place at this location, which is detrimental to the balance and uniformity of the street scene.&amp;nbsp; The proposal is therefore considered an uncharacteristic and unsympathetic addition to the street scene and surrounding local area. The proposal is considered unacceptable and contrary to the following development polices:&lt;/p&gt;"
