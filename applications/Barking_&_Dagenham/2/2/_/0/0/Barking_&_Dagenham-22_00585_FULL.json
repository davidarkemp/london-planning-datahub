    "&lt;p&gt;The retrospective development fails to provide sufficient internal and external amenity space and CEL area&#x27;s for a three bedroom, one-storey dwelling in Flat 2 and Flat 1 fails to provide at least one double bedroom in a two bedroom dwelling. The proposal would therefore provide a substandard quality of accommodation detrimental to the standard of living of future residents. Therefore, the proposal fails to comply with:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- National Planning Policy Framework (MHCLG, February 2019);&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Policy D6 of the London Plan (March 2021)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Policies BP5 and BP6 of the LDF Borough Wide Development Plan Policies DPD (March 2011) Technical Housing Standards&lt;/p&gt;",
    "&lt;p&gt;The retrospective HMO has potential to increase activity level and coming and goings to and from the site leading to additional levels of noise and disturbance at the property. This is considered to have a negative impact on neighbouring amenity and in turn the health and wellbeing of neighbouring residents. As such the proposal is contrary to:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- National Planning Policy Framework (MHCLG, February 2019)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Policies BP8 and BP11 of the Borough Wide DPD (March 2011)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Policies DMD 1, SP 7 and DMSI 3 of the Draft Local Plan Regulation 19 consultation version (October 2020)&lt;/p&gt;",
    "&lt;p&gt;The proposal results in the loss of a 3+ bedroom family sized dwelling which is the type of housing in high demand within the Borough. Therefore the negatives arising from the proposal are considered to outweigh any significant benefits as such having regard to the presumption in favour of sustainable development on balance the principle of development is considered unacceptable and contrary to:-&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- National Planning Policy Framework (MHCLG, February 2019)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Policies GG4, H1, H2 and H9 of the London Plan (March 2021)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Policies CM1, CM2 and CC1 of the Core Strategy DPD (July 2010)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Policy BC4 of the Borough Wide DPD (March 2011)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Policies SPDG1, SP3 and DMH4&amp;nbsp; of the Draft Local Plan Regulation 19 consultation version (October 2020)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Housing Supplementary Planning Guidance (GLA, March 2016, Updated August 2017)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- London Borough of Barking and Dagenham Housing Delivery Test Action Plan 2020&lt;/p&gt;"
