    "&lt;p&gt;The scale, siting and design of the double storey side extension would lead to the closure of a significant gap between the application site and neighbouring property No.4 Alibon Road which is characteristic of the properties located on corner plots at cross junctions within the area. The proposal would also harm the&amp;nbsp; distinctive Becontree Estate. As such, the proposed development is contrary to:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- National Planning Policy Framework (MHCLG, February 2019);&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Policies 7.1, 7.4 and 7.6 of The London Plan (March 2016);&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Policy D4 and D8 of the Draft London Plan Intended to Publish (December 2019);&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Policies CP2 and CP3 of the LDF Core Strategy (July 2010);&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Policies BP2, and BP11 of the LDF Borough Wide Development Plan Policies DPD (March 2011);&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- The Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document (February 2012);&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Policies SP2, DMD1, DMD4 and SPP6 of the Draft Local Plan (Regulation 19 Consultation version, October 2020&lt;/p&gt;",
    "&lt;p&gt;Officers consider the proposed first floor rear and the double storey side extension to represent unsympathetic and uncharacteristic additions to the dwellinghouse detrimental to the character and appearance of the street scene, dwellinghouse, wider terrace and the distinctive Becontree Estate. The scale and massing of the proposed extensions are not subservient or proportionate in their design when viewed against the scale and context of the existing dwelling.&amp;nbsp; The proposed development is therefore contrary to:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- National Planning Policy Framework (MHCLG, February 2019);&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Policies 7.1, 7.4 and 7.6 of The London Plan (March 2016);&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Policy D4 and D8 of the Draft London Plan Intended to Publish (December 2019);&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Policies CP2 and CP3 of the LDF Core Strategy (July 2010);&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Policies BP2, and BP11 of the LDF Borough Wide Development Plan Policies DPD (March 2011);&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- The Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document (February 2012);&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Policies SP2, DMD1, DMD4 and SPP6 of the Draft Local Plan (Regulation 19 Consultation version, October 2020&lt;/p&gt;"
