    "&lt;p&gt;The proposed part two-storey part single-storey side extension, by reason of its unsympathetic design and sitting and uneven frontage and roof lines would generate harm upon the character and appearance of the existing dwelling and would detriment the uniformity of the host terrace and the street scene on Mayfield Road and harm the pleasing architectural design of the Becontree Estate. The proposed single storey rear extension contributes towards the cumulative harm to the character of the existing dwellinghouse generated by the proposal.&amp;nbsp; The proposed development is therefore contrary to:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- National Planning Policy Framework (MHCLG, February 2019);&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Policies 7.1, 7.4, 7.6 and 7.8 of The London Plan (March 2016);&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Policies D4, D8 and HC1 of the Draft London Plan Intended to Publish (December 2019);&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Policies SP2, SP4, DMD1,&amp;nbsp; DMD4 DMNE3&amp;nbsp;and DMD6 of the Draft Local Plan (Regulation 19)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Policies CR2, CP2 and CP3 of the LDF Core Strategy (July 2010);&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Policies BP2, BP8 and BP11 of the LDF Borough Wide Development Plan Policies DPD (March 2011);&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- The Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document (February 2012)&lt;/p&gt;",
    "&lt;p&gt;The mass, design and sitting of the proposed side part two-storey part single-storey side extension represents poor quality development which would result in an increased sense of overbearingness, overshadowing and a loss of outlook and privacy for neighbours at adjacent property no.2 Mayfield Road.
