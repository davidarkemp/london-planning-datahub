    "&lt;p&gt;The proposed development will abut the boundary with No. 41 Saint Awdry&#x27;s Road, extending 8.575 metres beyond the neighbouring rear window. This results in an unacceptable impacts on the living conditions of this neighbour in relation to the sense of overbearing and enclosure, overshadowing and the loss of daylight and outlook as a consequence.

    "&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;&quot;&gt;The\r\nproposed development, by reason of failing to respect the character and appearance of the host dwelling and local area, is unacceptable. The introduction of a sloped roof, extending beyond the existing\r\noutrigger combining with a flat roof results in a range of roof types and an overall significant discordant addition to the host dwelling. The development will result in the further overdevelopment of the plot, creating undersized area of external amenity space, detrimental to the current and future residents.&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;As such, the development is contrary to:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- National Planning Policy Framework (MHCLG, February 2019)&lt;br&gt;- Policies 7.1, 7.4 and 7.6 of The London Plan (March 2016)&lt;br&gt;- Policies D1 and D4 of the Draft London Plan (December 2019)&lt;br&gt;- Policy CP3 of the Core Strategy DPD (July 2010)&lt;br&gt;- Policies BP11 of the Borough Wide DPD (March 2011)&lt;br&gt;- Policies SP2, DMD1, DMNE3 and DMD6 of the Draft Local Plan (Regulation 19 Consultation version, October 2020).&lt;br&gt;- Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD (February 2012)&lt;/p&gt;"
