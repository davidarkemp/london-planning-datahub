    "&lt;p&gt;Officers would consider the mass, bulk and sitting of the proposed double storey side extension and part first-floor rear extension to appear incongruous, generating harm upon the character of the dwelling and surrounding environment. The proposed development, especially when combined with the approved rear dormer would lead to an over-development of the site. The varying roof types and heights would convey even more of an unsymmetrical and divided external appearance from the front and side elevations. The proposed development is therefore contrary to:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- National Planning Policy Framework (MHCLG, February 2019);&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Policies 7.1, 7.4 and 7.6 of The London Plan (March 2016);&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Policy D4 of the Draft London Plan Intended to Publish (December 2019);&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Policies SP 2, DMD 1 and DMD 6 of the Draft Local Plan (Regulation 19)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Policy CP3 of the LDF Core Strategy (July 2010);&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Policies BP8 and BP11 of the LDF Borough Wide Development Plan Policies DPD (March 2011);&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- The Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document (February 2012)&lt;/p&gt;",
    "&lt;p&gt;The proposed development represents poor quality design which would result in an increased sense of overbearingness, overshadowing and a loss of outlook to neighbouring properties. Therefore constituting an unneighbourly development and contrary to:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- National Planning Policy Framework (MHCLG, February 2019);&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Policies 7.1, 7.4 and 7.6 of The London Plan (March 2016);&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Policy D4 of the Draft London Plan Intended to Publish (December 2019);&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Policy DMD 1 and DMD 6 of the Draft Local Plan (Regulation 19)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Policy CP3 of the LDF Core Strategy (July 2010);&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Policies BP8 and BP11 of the LDF Borough Wide Development Plan Policies DPD (March 2011);&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- The Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document (February 2012);&lt;/p&gt;",
    "&lt;p&gt;As a result of the positioning of the proposed side extension and the proximity to the boundary, the ground floor rooms would not receive adequate natural light and would therefore generate negative implications to current and future living conditions. The proposed development would therefore be contrary to:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- National Planning Policy Framework (MHCLG, February 2019);&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Policies 7.1, 7.4 and 7.6 of The London Plan (March 2016);&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Policy D4 of the Draft London Plan Intended to Publish (December 2019);&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Policies SP 2, DMD 1 and DMD 6 of the Draft Local Plan (Regulation 19)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Policy CP3 of the LDF Core Strategy (July 2010);&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Policies BP8 and BP11 of the LDF Borough Wide Development Plan Policies DPD (March 2011);&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- The Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document (February 2012)&lt;/p&gt;"
