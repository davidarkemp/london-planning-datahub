    "&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:11pt&quot;&gt;The proposed dwelling fails to provide the minimum required gross internal floor area and storage space for a property of its size. As such, officers consider the proposal to provide a substandard quality of accommodation detrimental to the standard of living of future residents. The proposal is therefore considered unacceptable and contrary to:-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",
    "&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:11pt&quot;&gt;The proposed dwellinghouse for reasons of design&amp;nbsp;the proposal fails to respect and reflect the built form of the host dwelling as it introduces a new design which fails to respect the existing&amp;nbsp;single building frontage and roof scape. Consequently, the new dwellinghouse appears as a subordinate extension to the existing dwelling rather than a dwellinghouse in its own right. Further, for reasons of sitting the proposal will close off the gap between the architectural built form of Nesham Road and the boundary line with Davington Road, hence, resulting in the loss of openness which will be harmful to the uniformity of the junction and the character of the street scene. Likewise, due to the proposals sitting it will be visible from the public realm, therefore, by virtue of size, scale, mass and bulk the proposal will appear disproportionately&amp;nbsp;large in comparison to the host dwelling and therefore out of place and out of character at this location. Overall, the proposal is considered an uncharacteristic and unsympathetic addition to the dwellinghouse detrimental to the character and appearance of the street scene, dwelling, terrace row and surrounding local area. The impact on the character and appearance is notable given the sites location within the Becontree Estate. The proposal is therefore considered unacceptable and contrary to:-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",
    "&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:11pt&quot;&gt;The proposed dwelling fails to provide any cycle storage provision. In addition, the proposed off-street car parking would result in the loss of an on-street parking space which would result in greater congestion due to the loss of parking amenity. This is notable given the sites low PTAL. Likewise, the proposed car parking space for the new dwellinghouse is considered to be an unsatisfactory and potentially unsafe parking arrangement which would increase vehicle movements over the pavement and conflict or prejudice the pedestrian environment. The proposed cycle and parking arrangements are therefore considered to be unacceptable and contrary to:-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;"
