Noting this road is narrow and currently heavily used by vehicles accessing the rear service yards of the commercial properties along Becontree Avenue and the industrial workshops on Motts Lane. It is considered the intensified use will be detrimental to highway and pedestrian safety. The proposal is considered unacceptable and contrary to:-&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;",
