    "&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:11pt&quot;&gt;The proposed development for reasons of size, scale, mass, bulk and sitting would constitute an overbearing and unneighbourly development which would result in the material loss of outlook to no.51 and 57 and unacceptable levels of overshadowing thus resulting in the material loss of daylight and sunlight to the habitable rooms of no.51. The proposal is therefore considered to have a harmful impact on the standard of living of neighbouring residents. Further, the proposal seeks to provide accommodation for up to 10 residents, however, with the addition of staff it is likely there may be more than 10 people, hence, the proposal is considered to result in the creation of more noise, waste, comings and going and general disturbances than currently exists on site.&amp;nbsp; The proposal is therefore&amp;nbsp;considered unacceptable and contrary to:-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",
    "&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:11pt&quot;&gt;The proposed change of use from a single dwellinghouse (C3) to a children care home (C2) would represent the loss of a family sized dwellinghouse within the Borough. Whilst policies also seek to ensure the provision of specialist housing the applicant has failed to provide substantial evidence which suggests there is an identified need in the Borough and at this location. Therefore, on balance officers consider the loss of a family sized dwelling which is the type of housing this Borough seeks to preserve to outweigh the need for more specialist housing. The proposal is therefore contrary to:-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",
    "&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:11pt&quot;&gt;The proposed internal layout of the proposal will result in first floor bedrooms being accessed only by a small staircase. Due to the nature of the scheme being an elderly care home it is likely residents will have limited mobility, hence, officers do not consider the accessibility and quality of accommodation to meet the needs of its future users. The proposal is therefore considered unacceptable and contrary to:-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",
    "&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:11pt&quot;&gt;The proposed development seeks to remove the existing front door on no.53 and replace it with a window as such unbalancing the uniformity and symmetry of the two properties. Consequently, the application site will look disproportionately large in comparison to the adjacent properties detrimental to the character and appearance of the street scene. The proposal is therefore considered unacceptable and contrary to:-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",
    "&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:11pt&quot;&gt;The proposal has provided limited details as to how residents will be taken to and from the site and how many staff and visitors will be present at any given time. As these users will rely on on-street parking due to the lack of information a full assessment cannot be carried out as to what impact the proposal will have on the highway or local parking amenity. Consequently, this matter is considered unacceptable and contrary to:-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:11pt&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;"
