    "&lt;p&gt;The mass and bulk of the proposed annexe represents poor quality development and will sit at an elevated level in a prominent position within the rear garden, therefore resulting in an increased sense of overbearingness, overshadowing and a loss of outlook and privacy for neighbouring properties. Therefore constituting an unneighbourly development and contrary to:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- National Planning Policy Framework (MHCLG, February 2019);&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Policies 7.1, 7.4 and 7.6 of The London Plan (March 2016);&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Policy D4 of the Draft London Plan Intended to Publish (December 2019);&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Policy DMD 1 and DMD 6 of the Draft Local Plan (Regulation 19)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Policy CP3 of the LDF Core Strategy (July 2010);&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Policies BP8 and BP11 of the LDF Borough Wide Development Plan Policies DPD (March 2011);&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- The Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document (February 2012);&lt;/p&gt;",
    "&lt;p&gt;The significant size of the proposed annexe is not considered conducive or indeed ancillary to what would ordinarily and reasonably be expected for this setting, rather it would be substantially excessive in size and thus leading itself to forming a part of the primary accommodation onsite, rather than merely ancillary use to the dwelling. Officers therefore do not consider this proposed development would reasonably constitute a building incidental to the enjoyment of the dwellinghouse and would harm the character and appearance of the existing property. The proposed development is therefore contrary to:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;National Planning Policy Framework (MHCLG, February 2019);&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Policies 7.1, 7.4 and 7.6 of The London Plan (March 2016);&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Policy D4 of the Draft London Plan Intended to Publish (December 2019);&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Policies SP 2, DMD 1 and DMD 6 of the Draft Local Plan (Regulation 19)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Policy CP3 of the LDF Core Strategy (July 2010);&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Policies BP8 and BP11 of the LDF Borough Wide Development Plan Policies DPD (March 2011);&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- The Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document (February 2012)&lt;/p&gt;"
