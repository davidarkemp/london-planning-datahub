    "The development permitted shall be begun before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.\r\rReason:\rTo comply with Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended by S.51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act  2004)",
    "The development hereby permitted shall be carried out in accordance with the following approved plans: ^IN;\r\rReason: For the avoidance of doubt and in the interests of proper planning.",
    "All new external works shall utilise materials to match exactly in colour, size, shape, texture, positioning and arrangement of the adjacent building.  All brickwork, face-bond, pointing and painting shall match exactly those of the adjacent building in accordance with Policy DE32 of the Unitary Development Plan.\r\rReason:\rTo preserve the character of the building and locality.",
    "The proposed development shall achieve a Certificate of Compliance in respect of the Secured by Design scheme, or alternatively achieve security standards (based on Secured by Design principles) to the satisfaction of the Metropolitan Police, details of whic shall be provided to the Local Planning Authority for its written approval prior to the first occupation of the approved development. All security measures applied to the approved development shall be permanently retained thereafter. \r\rReason: To ensure safe and secure development and reduce crime.",
    "Prior to occupation of any non-residential unit hereby permitted with a commercial kitchen, details of any ventilation system for the removal and treatment of cooking odours from any commercial catering, including its apperance and measures to mitigate system noise, are to be sumbitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority. The measures shall have regard to and be commensurate with guidance and recommendations in:\r\r- The current edition of publication \"Specification for Kitchen Ventilation Systems\", DW/172, Heating and Ventilating Contractors Association, or other relevant and authoritative guidance; and \r-Publication, \"Control of Odour and Noise from Commercial Kitchen Exhaust Systems- Update to the 2004 report prepared by NETCEN for the Department for Envrionment, Food and Rural Affairs\", Ricardo.com, 2018.\r\rThe approved details shall be fully implemented before the first use of the relevant non-residential unit and shall thereafter be permanently retained in an efficent manner.\r\rReason: To safeguard the apperance of the premises and minimise the impact of cooking smells, odours and noise in accordance with policies BR13, BP8 and BP11 of the Borough Wide Development Policies Development Plan Document.",
    "No development shall commence until:\r\r(a) an investigation and risk assesement, in addition to any assessement provided with the planning application, has been completed in accordance with a scheme to assess the nature and extent of any contaimination on the site, whether or not it originated on the site. The contents of the scheme are subject to the approval in writing of the Local Planning Authority. The investigation and risk assesement must be undertaken by competent persons and a written report of the findings must be produced. The written report is subject to the approval in writing of the Local Planning Authority. The report of the findings must include:\r\r(i) a survey of the extent, scale and nature of contamination;\r(ii) an assesement of the potential risks to human health; property (existing or proposed) including buildings, crops, livestock, pets, woodland and services lines and pipes; adjoining land; groundwaters and surface waters; ecological systems; archaeological sites and ancient monuments; and \r(iii) an appraisal of remedial options, and proposal of the preferred option(s).\r\rThis must be conducted in accordance with DEFRA and the Envrionement Agency's Model Procedures for the Management of Land Contamination, CLR 11'; and \r\r(b) a detailed remediation scheme, to bring the site to a condition suitable for the intended use by removing unacceptable risks to human health, buildings and othe rproperty and the natural and historic envrionment, has been prepared and submitted to the Local Planning Authority for approval in writing. The scheme must include all works to be undertaken, proposed remediation objecitves and remediation criteria, timetable of works and site managment procedures. The scheme must ensure that the site will not qualify as contaminated land under Part 2A of the Envrionmental Protection Act 1990 in relation to the intended use of the land after remediation.\r\r(c) The approved remediation scheme must be carried out in accordance with its terms prior to commencement of the development, other than that required to carry out remediation, unless otherwise agreed by the Local Planning Authority. The Local Planning Authority must be given two weeks written notification of commencement of the remediation scheme works.\r\rFollowing completion of measures identified in the appove remediation scheme, a verification report that demonstrates the effectiveness of the remediation carried out must be produced and is subject to the approval in writing of the Local Planning Authority. The report shall include results of sampling and monitoring carried out to demonstrate that the site remediation criteria have been met. \r\r(d) In the events that contaminated is found at any time when carrying out the approved development that was not previosuly identified it must be reported in writing immediately to the Local Planning Authority. An investigation and risk assessment must be undertaken in accordance with the requirements of (a), and where remediation is necessary a remediation scheme must be preopared in accordance with the requirements of (b), which is subject to the approval in writing of the Local Planning Authority. Following completion of measures identified in the approved remediation scheme a verification report must be prepared, which is subject to the approval of the Local Planning Authority.\r\rReason: Contamination must be identified prior to commencement of development to ensure that risks from land contamination to the future users of the land and neighbouring land are minimised, together with those to controlled waters, property and ecological systems, and to ensure that the development can be carried out safely without acceptable risks to workers, neighbours and other off-site receptors in accordance with policy BR5 of the Borough Wide Development Policies Development Plan Document and policy 5.21 of London Plan.",
    "Noise from the non-residential uses hereby permitted, including, but not limited to, live and amplified music shall be controlled so as to be inaudible inside adjoining and other noise-sensitive premises in the vicinity of those uses. The initial test for compliance with the 'inaudibility' criterion will be that noise should be no more than barely audible outside those noise-sensitive premises. In the event there is disagreement as to whether such noise is or is not audible the following numerical limits shall be used to determine compliance with this condition:\r- the LAeq (CUAN) shall not exceed LA90 (WCUAN); and \r- the L10 (CUAN) shall not exceed L90 (WCUAN) in any 1/3 octave band between 40Hz and 160Hz.\r\rCUAN= Commercial/Community Use Activity Noise Level, WCUAN = representative background noise level without commercial/community use activity noise, both measured 1 metre from the facade of the noise-sensitive premises. \r\rThe combined rating level of the noise from any plant installed pursuant to this permission (other than plant which is only to be operated in emergency circumstances) shall not exceed the exisiting background noise level outside the window to any noise-sensitive room. Any assesment of compliance in this regard shall be made according to the methodology and procedures presented in BS4142:2014.\r\rAny machinery and equipment installed pursuant to this permission shall be designed and installed to ensure that structure borne (re-radiated) noise emissions shall not exceed 35 LAeq dB (5 min) when measured in any habitable room adjoining residential premises. \r\rReason: To ensure that the proposed and surrounding residential properties and other noise-sensitive premises in the vicinity of site are adequately protected from noise and in accordance with policy BR13 of the Borough Wide Development Policies Development Plan Document and policy 7.15 of the London Plan.",
    "No demolition or development shall take place until a Desk Based Assesment has been submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority.  For land that is included within the Assesment, no demolition or development shall take place other than in accordance with the agreed assesment, which shall include the statement of significance and research objectives, and\r\rA.  The programme and methodology of site investigation and recording and the nomination of a competent person(s) or organisation to undertake the agreed works; and\r\rB.  The programme for post-investigation assessment and subsequent analysis, publication and dissemination and deposition of resulting material.  This part of the condition shall not be discharged until these elements have been fulfilled in accordance with the programme set out in the assesment.\r\rReason:  Heritage assets of archaeological interest may survive on the site.  The Local Planning Authority wishes to secure appropriate archaeological investigation prior to development, followed by the publication of results, in accordance with policies BP2 and BP3 of the Borough Wide Development Policies Development Plan Document."
