Any trees or plants which within a period of 5 years from the completion of the development die, are removed or become seriously damaged or diseased, shall be replaced in the next planting season with others of similar size and species unless the Local Planning Authority gives written consent to any variation.\r\rReason:  To secure the provision and retention of the landscaping in the interests of the visual amenity of the area and in accordance with policy BP11 of the Borough Wide Development Policies Development Plan Document and Section 197 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990.",

    "Noise from Non-Residential Uses and Plant and Structure Borne Noise Emissions\r\rNoise from the non-residential uses hereby permitted, including, but not limited to, live and amplified music shall be controlled so as to be inaudible inside adjoining and other noise-sensitive premises in the vicinity of those uses.  The initial test for compliance with the 'inaudibility' criterion will be that noise should be no more than barely audible outside those noise-sensitive premises.  In the event there is disagreement as to whether such noise is or is not audible the following numerical limits shall be used to determine compliance with this condition:\r\ro\tthe LAeq (CUAN) shall not exceed LA90 (WCUAN); and\ro\tthe L10 (CUAN) shall not exceed L90 (WCUAN) in any 1/3 octave band between 40Hz and 160Hz.\r\rCUAN = Commercial/Community Use Activity Noise Level, WCUAN = representative background noise level without commercial/community use activity noise, both measured 1 metre from the façade of the noise-sensitive premises.\r\rThe combined rating level of the noise from any plant installed pursuant to this permission (other than plant which is only to be operated in emergency circumstances) shall not exceed the existing background noise level outside the window to any noise-sensitive room.  Any assessment of compliance in this regard shall be made according to the methodology and procedures presented in BS4142:2014.\r\rAny machinery and equipment installed pursuant to this permission shall be designed and installed to ensure that structure borne (re-radiated) noise emissions shall not exceed 35 LAeq dB (5 min) when measured in any habitable room in adjoining residential premises.\r\rReason:  To ensure that the proposed and surrounding residential properties and other noise-sensitive premises in the vicinity of site are adequately protected from noise and in accordance with policy BR13 of the Borough Wide Development Policies Development Plan Document and policy 7.15 of the London Plan."
