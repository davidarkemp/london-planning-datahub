    "&lt;p&gt;The proposed development, by reason of the unacceptable scale and massing of the side and rear extension, combined with the proposed conversion of the roof forming a gable end is unacceptable. The introduction of an uncharacteristic gable end roof will appear discordant within the street scene and within the Becontree Estate. The proposed roof on the first floor rear extension is unsympathetic due to the angle of development along the site boundary which is unacceptable. The overall development results in the overdevelopment of the plot with an unacceptable size of rear garden remaining for a proposed larger family home with a significant loss of grassed area. As such the development is contrary to:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- National Planning Policy Framework (MHCLG, February 2019)&lt;br&gt;- Policies 7.1, 7.4, 7.6 and 7.8 of The London Plan (March 2016)&lt;br&gt;- Policies HC1, D1 and D4 of the Draft London Plan (December 2019)&lt;br&gt;- Policies CP2 and CP3 of the Core Strategy DPD (July 2010)&lt;br&gt;- Policies BP2, BP5 and BP11 of the Borough Wide DPD (March 2011)&lt;br&gt;- Policies SPP6, SP2, DMD1, DMNE3, DMD6 and DMD4 of the Draft Local Plan (Regulation 19 Consultation version, June 2020).&lt;br&gt;- Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD (February 2012)&lt;/p&gt;",
