    "&lt;p&gt;The application proposes development beyond the red line boundary of the site which is considered unacceptable and as such, is to be constructed on council owned land. Further, the existing plans are incorrect showing doors indicated in places where they are not located. The principle of development, in creating a residential dwelling in a residential area is supported.&lt;/p&gt;",
    "&lt;p&gt;Officers have had regard to the proposal and have considered it against the development plan and have had regard to material planning considerations and on balance find that the design, massing, the introduction of new doors, the infilling of the important architectural gap today, for the purpose of providing a new dwelling in this space is not supported. The proposed dwellinghouse for reasons of design and siting as outlined above, fails to respect and reflect the built form of the existing dwellinghouse and detract from the balance and uniformity of the semi-detached pair this property is a part of. The proposal would therefore represent and uncharacteristic and unsympathetic addition to the dwellinghouse harmful to the character and appearance of the street scene, dwelling, wider terrace and the surrounding local area. The impact the proposal has on the character and identity of the Becontree Estate adds greater weight to the harm caused by the proposal. Therefore, the proposal is contrary to:-&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- National Planning Policy Framework (MHCLG, February 2019)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Policies 7.1, 7.4 and 7.6 of The London Plan (March 2016)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Policy D4 of the Draft London Plan Intended to Publish (December 2019)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Policies CP2, CM1 and CP3 of the LDF Core Strategy (July 2010)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Policies BP2 and BP11 of the LDF Borough Wide Development Plan Policies DPD (March 2011)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Policies SP4, DM11, DM14 and DM16 of the Draft Local Plan (Regulation 18 Consultation version, November 2019).&lt;/p&gt;",
    "&lt;p&gt;Officers consider that the addition of a new dwelling and an increase in the size of the existing units to create three larger&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;units from the existing two smaller units, will have an unacceptable impact on neighbouring amenity of the neighbouring residents and those living within the banjo-double banjo cul-de-sac with issues including a significant uplift in trips and comings and goings from the property which will occur if the existing one bedroom flats are enlarged and a new dwelling is created and in regards to general activity and waste. Officers consider this to be worsened by the location of the property at the end of a pedestrianised double banjo cul-de-sac and that there is nowhere for additional car parking stress, or off-site car parking to be provided. The area of car parking proposed is via a pedestrian path which is considered unacceptable along with inadequate cycle parking provisions and overall access requirements. As such the proposal s considered contrary to:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- National Planning Policy Framework (MHCLG, February 2019)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Policies 3.5, 6.2, 6.3, 6.9, 6.13, 7.1, 7.4, 7.6, 7.15 and Table 6.2 of The London Plan (March 2016)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Policy GG1, GG3, D14, D3, T3, T5, T6, T6.1, Table 10.2 and Table 10.3 of the Draft London Plan Intended to Publish&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(December 2019)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Policies BP8, BR3 and BR9 of the LDF Borough Wide Development Plan Policies DPD (March 2011)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Policies SP4, DM11, DM16, DM25 and DM32 of the Draft Local Plan (Regulation 18 Consultation version, November 2019).&lt;/p&gt;",
    "&lt;p&gt;Officers consider the proposed development to provide inadequate space for future residents with failings in relation to the lack of a double bedroom within the ground floor flat, undersized internal storage areas and a below standard gross internal floor area within the two bedroom house. As such, the proposal is considered contrary to:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;National Planning Policy Framework (MHCLG, February 2019)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Policies 3.5 and 7.6 of The London Plan&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Policy D6 of the Draft London Plan&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Draft Policy DM3 of the Draft Local Plan&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Policy BP5 and BP 6 of the Borough Wide DPD&lt;/p&gt;"
