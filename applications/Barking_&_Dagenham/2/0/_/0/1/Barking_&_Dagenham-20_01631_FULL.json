    "&lt;p&gt;The proposed new 1-bedroom flat fails to meet the minimum internal space standards as set out in the nationally described space standards with regards to the internal gross floor area and storage provisions. Further the proposed 3-bedroom flat fails to provide at least one double bedroom with the proposed double bedroom falling below the minimum standards for this type of room and provides inadequate storage provisions.&amp;nbsp;This will result in unacceptable living conditions detrimental to the living standards of future residents of this property, contrary to:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• National Planning Policy Framework (MHCLG, February 2019)&lt;br&gt;• Policies 3.5 and 7.6 of The London Plan (March 2016)&lt;br&gt;• Policies D6 of the Draft London Plan Intended to Publish (December 2019)&lt;br&gt;• Policies BP6 of the Borough Wide Development Plan Document (March 2011)&lt;br&gt;• Policies DM2 and DM3 of the Draft Local Plan Regulation 18 consultation version (November 2019)&lt;br&gt;• Technical housing Standards- Nationally Described Space Standards (March 2015)&lt;/p&gt;",
    "&lt;p&gt;The conversion of the top floor of the existing dwelling house into a flat would&amp;nbsp;result in the loss of neighbouring amenity at 106 Cornworthy Road, as residents of this new flat will rely on the amenity of No. 106 for its outlook to the rear, impacting privacy, detrimental to the living conditions of present and future residents. Therefore, the proposal is contrary to:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• National Planning Policy Framework (MHCLG, February 2019)&lt;br&gt;• Policies 3.5, 7.1, 7.4, 7.6 and 7.15 of The London Plan (March 2016)&lt;br&gt;• Policies GG1, GG3 and D14 of the Draft London Plan Intended to Publish (December 2019)&lt;br&gt;• Policy BP8 of the Borough Wide DPD (March 2011)&lt;br&gt;• Policies SP4, DM11, DM16, DM25 of the Draft Local Plan Regulation 18 consultation version (November 2019)&lt;/p&gt;",
    "&lt;p&gt;The proposed conversion of an existing 3-bedroom dwelling into two flats, one 3-bedroom and one 1-bedroom represents the loss of a family dwelling house within the borough; a a form of housing the Council is seeking to protect from conversion. Therefore, this application fails to be acceptable when regarding the principle of development, contrary to:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• National Planning Policy Framework (MHCLG, February 2019)&lt;br&gt;• Policies 3.3, 3.5 and 3.8 of The London Plan (March 2016)&lt;br&gt;• Policies GG4, H8, H9 and H10 of the Draft London Plan Intended to Publish (December 2019)&lt;br&gt;• Policies CM1 and CM2 of the Core Strategy DPD (July 2010)&lt;br&gt;• Policy BC4 of the Borough Wide DPD (March 2011)&lt;br&gt;• Policies DM2 and DM3 of the Draft Local Plan Regulation 18 consultation version (November 2019)&lt;/p&gt;",
    "&lt;p&gt;The proposed side extension by reason of its mass, bulk and sitting would look detached and disproportionate in relation to the existing property as such it would result in an unsympathetic, unbalancing and uncharacteristic addition which would result in the harmful erosion of the character and appearance of the host property, the terrace and of the openness of the entrance to the bajo cul-de-sac. The additional front door between the ground floor window and the porch will further impact the balanced nature of the dwelling within the street scene. The proposed bin store and cycle storage will be constructed up to the site boundary making the development appear overly intrusive within the street scene. As such, the proposed development is contrary to;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• National Planning Policy Framework (MHCLG, February 2019)&lt;br&gt;• Policies 7.1, 7.4 and 7.6 of The London Plan (March 2016)&lt;br&gt;• Policies D4 of the Draft London Plan Intended to Publish (December 2019)&lt;br&gt;• Policy CP2, CP3 and CM1 of the Core Strategy DPD (July 2010)&lt;br&gt;• Policy BP8 and BP11 of the Borough Wide DPD (March 2011)&lt;br&gt;• Policies SP4, DM11, DM14 and DM16 of the Draft Local Plan Regulation 18 consultation version (November 2019)&lt;br&gt;• The Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD (February 2012)&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;"
