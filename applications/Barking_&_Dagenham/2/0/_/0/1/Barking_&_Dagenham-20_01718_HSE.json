    "&lt;p&gt;The proposed second front porch and entrance, by reason of its design and sitting&amp;nbsp;fails to respect the character and appearance of the area and would convey a divided appearance to the dwelling. Furthermore,&amp;nbsp; previous planning history also reveals that the premises has an extensive history of unauthorised HMO use, and as such, Officers would argue that the development could promote this. It is noted that the Council has specific policies against the loss of family dwellings within the borough.&amp;nbsp; Therefore, it is for these reasons that the proposed development is contrary to the following policies:-&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- National Planning Policy Framework (MHCLG, February 2019);&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Policies 7.1, 7.4, 7.5 and 7.6 of The London Plan (March 2016);&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Policy D1, D4 and D8 of the Draft London Plan Intended to Publish (December 2019);&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Policy CP3 of the LDF Core Strategy (July 2010);&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Policy BP11 of the LDF Borough Wide Development Plan Policies DPD (March 2011);&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- The Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document (February 2012);&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Policies SP2, SP4 DMD1, DMD6 of the Draft Local Plan (Regulation 19 Consultation version, October 2020)&lt;/p&gt;"
