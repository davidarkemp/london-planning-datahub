    "&lt;p&gt;The proposed development will result in an unacceptable impact on the living conditions of the neighbouring property No. 312 Hedgemans Road with regard to an unacceptable sense of overbearing and enclosure within the rear garden. Therefore the development is contrary to:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Policies BP8 and BP11 of the Local Development Framework Borough Wide Development Plan (March 2011)&lt;br&gt;- Policies DMD1 and DMD6 of the Draft Local Plan (Regulation 19 Consultation version, June 2020)&lt;br&gt;- The Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD (February 2012).&lt;/p&gt;",
    "&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;line-height: 107%;&quot;&gt;The proposed development fails to respect the character and appearance of the area, w&lt;/span&gt;ith the proposed additions being unsympathetic and&amp;nbsp;uncharacteristic of the original dwelling house, the terrace and the wider &lt;span class=&quot;scayt-misspell-word&quot; data-scayt-word=&quot;Becontree&quot; data-wsc-lang=&quot;en_GB&quot; data-wsc-id=&quot;kgi71y4pxzh0tk0gb&quot; style=&quot;&quot;&gt;Becontree&lt;/span&gt; Estate, significantly&amp;nbsp;altering the symmetry, balance and built form of the&amp;nbsp;original dwelling and terrace within the street scene. The development will significantly reduce the gap between the host property and the neighbouring dwelling, No.312 &lt;span class=&quot;scayt-misspell-word&quot; data-scayt-word=&quot;Hedgemans&quot; data-wsc-lang=&quot;en_GB&quot; data-wsc-id=&quot;kgi71y8dm05u0d0ix&quot; style=&quot;&quot;&gt;Hedgemans&lt;/span&gt; Road, reducing an important architectural break, prominent when viewed from &lt;span class=&quot;scayt-misspell-word&quot; data-scayt-word=&quot;Lullington&quot; data-wsc-lang=&quot;en_GB&quot; data-wsc-id=&quot;kgi72s4oyxxb8vzsj&quot; style=&quot;&quot;&gt;Lullington&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;Road. The development&amp;nbsp;is worsened by the introduction of a gable end roof form, harmful to the &lt;span class=&quot;scayt-misspell-word&quot; data-scayt-word=&quot;Becontree&quot; data-wsc-lang=&quot;en_GB&quot; data-wsc-id=&quot;kgi71y8ctjmucl56w&quot; style=&quot;&quot;&gt;Becontree&lt;/span&gt; Estate. The proposed ground floor bedroom does not meet the needs of the homeowners and relies on two small obscure glazed windows for daylight which is insufficient.
