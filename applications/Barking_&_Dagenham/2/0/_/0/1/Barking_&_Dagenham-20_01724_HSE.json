    "&lt;p&gt;The proposed first-floor infill rear extension, by reason of its sitting would exceed the 45 degree angle from adjacent neighbouring property No. 106 Lyndhurst Gardens to the south, which would generate harmful material impacts to residents at this premises. The proposed first-floor rear extension is not considered to provide any meaningful amenity space and would generate unacceptable impacts to neighbouring amenity. The proposal is therefore contrary to the following policies:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- National Planning Policy Framework (MHCLG, February 2019);&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Policies 7.1, 7.4 and 7.6 of The London Plan (March 2016);&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Policy D4 of the Draft London Plan Intended to Publish (December 2019);&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Policy CP3 of the LDF Core Strategy (July 2010);&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Policies BP8 and BP11 of the LDF Borough Wide Development Plan Policies DPD (March 2011);&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- The Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document (February 2012);&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Policies SP2, SP4 DMD1, DMD4 and DMD6 of the Draft Local Plan (Regulation 19 Consultation version, October 2020)&lt;/p&gt;",
    "&lt;p&gt;The proposed outbuilding, by reason of its mass and bulk would be considered excessive for its proposed use, hence Officers are not satisfied that the outbuilding would be incidental to the use of the original dwellinghouse. Furthermore, the development would contribute towards a quantum of existing and proposed development to this property, causing the premises to appear over-developed and incongruous in relation to the surrounding built environment. The proposed veranda would further exacerbate this harm to the appearance of the dwelling and harm to amenity. As such,&amp;nbsp; the development is contrary to:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- National Planning Policy Framework (MHCLG, February 2019);&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Policies 7.1, 7.4 and 7.6 of The London Plan (March 2016);&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Policy D1, D4 and D8 of the Draft London Plan Intended to Publish (December 2019);&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Policy CP3 of the LDF Core Strategy (July 2010);&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Policies BP8 and BP11 of the LDF Borough Wide Development Plan Policies DPD (March 2011);&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- The Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document (February 2012);&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Policies SP2, SP4 DMD1, of the Draft Local Plan (Regulation 19 Consultation version, October 2020)&lt;/p&gt;"
