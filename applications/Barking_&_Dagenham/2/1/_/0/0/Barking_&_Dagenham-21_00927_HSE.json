    "&lt;p&gt;1. The proposed hip to gable loft conversion including a rear dormer window for reasons of design fails to respect and reflect\nthe built form of the host dwelling as it introduces a new gabled roof design at this location detrimental to the symmetry of the\nterrace row. Likewise, the proposal seeks to increase the height of the properties ridge unbalancing the uniformity of the roof\nscape harmful to the visual apperance of the street scene. The proposal therefore constitutes an uncharacteristic and\nunsympathetic addition to the dwellinghouse detrimental to the character and appearance of the street scene, property, terrace\nrow and the surrounding local area. The impact on the character and appearance of the area is notable given the sites location\nwithin the Becontree Estate. The proposal is therefore considered contrary to:-\nNational Planning Policy Framework (MHCLG, February 2019)\nPolicies D1, D4, D8 and HC1 of the London Plan (March 2021)\nPolicies CP3 and CP2 of the Core Strategy DPD (July 2010)\nPolicies BP11 and BP2 of the Borough Wide DPD (March 2011)\nPolicies SP2, SP4, DMD1, DMD4 and DMD6 of the Draft Local Plan Regulation 19 consultation version (October 2020)\nThe above policies can be viewed on the Council&#x27;s website: www.lbbd.gov.uk/planning.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;"
