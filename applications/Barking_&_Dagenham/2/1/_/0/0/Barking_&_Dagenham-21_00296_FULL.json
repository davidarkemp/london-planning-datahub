    "&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:11pt&quot;&gt;The proposed 2 x 3 bedroom, 5 person, 3 storey dwelling fails to provide the minimum required gross internal area, bedroom widths and built in storage. As such, the proposal is considered to provide a substandard quality of accommodation detrimental to the standard of living of future residents of the property. The proposal is therefore considered unacceptable and contrary to:-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",
    "&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:11pt&quot;&gt;The proposed 2 x 3 bedroom dwellings and 1 x 1 bedroom dwelling for reasons of design, size and sitting&amp;nbsp;fails to respect and reflect the built form, character, materials and roof design&amp;nbsp;of the host dwellinghouse as it seeks to introduces new roof design, new materials and seeks to construct&amp;nbsp;3 properties on a plot which originally had 1. As such the proposal will appear cramped within its plot&amp;nbsp;detrimental to the character and appearance of the street scene as it will break up the rhythm and flow of the northern side of the street. In addition, for reasons of design the relationship between the three properties appears more akin to a dwellinghouse and side extension than 3 dwellinghouses in their own right. As such from the street scene the proposal will appear as a single dwellinghouse with three front doors harmful to the character and appearance of the street scene. The proposal is therefore considered unacceptable and contrary to:-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",
    "&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:11pt&quot;&gt;The proposed development would increase the number of households on site to 3 and the number of residents to 12. As such, the proposal is considered to result in the generation of more noise, waste, light, comings and goings and general disturbances than currently produced on site. In addition, the proposed dwellings will extend beyond the rear elevation of 972 Rainham Road South by 4.1 metres. Therefore, for reasons of size, scale and sitting the proposal is considered to result in unacceptable loss of neighbouring amenity detrimental to the standard of living of current and future residents of this property. The proposal is considered to constitute overbearing and unneighbourly development contrary to:-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",
    "&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:11pt&quot;&gt;The proposed development exceeds the maximum permitted parking provision set out in the London Plan for dwellings of this size. IN addition, the proposal will result in the loss of two on-street parking spaces. The proposal is therefore considered to have an unacceptable impact on local parking amenity and result in greater levels of congestion detrimental to the character and appearance of the area. The proposal is considered unacceptable and contrary to:-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;"
