The details shall include the numbers, size and routes of construction vehicles, provisions within/around the site to ensure that all vehicles associated with the construction works are properly managed to prevent any unwanted disruption to other highway users, and other matters relating to traffic management to be agreed with the licencing officers of the council. Approved details shall be implemented throughout the project period and any changes to the document must be reported back to the council’s planning and highways department.&lt;/p&gt;",

The written report is subject to the approval in writing of the Local&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Planning Authority. The report of the findings must include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(i) a survey of the extent, scale and nature of contamination;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(ii) an assessment of the potential risks to human health; property (existing or proposed) including buildings,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;crops, livestock, pets, woodland and service lines and pipes; adjoining land; groundwaters and surface&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;waters; ecological systems; archaeological sites and ancient monuments; and&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(iii) an appraisal of remedial options, and proposal of the preferred option(s).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This must be conducted in accordance with DEFRA and the Environment Agency’s ‘Land Contamination Risk&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Management (LCRM)’; and&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(b) a detailed remediation scheme, to bring the site to a condition suitable for the intended use by removing&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;unacceptable risks to human health, buildings and other property and the natural and historical environment, has&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;been prepared and submitted to the Local Planning Authority for approval in writing.

The Local Planning Authority must be given two weeks written notification of commencement&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;of the remediation scheme works.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following completion of measures identified in the approved remediation scheme, a verification report that&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;demonstrates the effectiveness of the remediation carried out must be produced and is subject to the approval in&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;writing of the Local Planning Authority. The report shall include results of sampling and monitoring carried out to&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;demonstrate that the site remediation criteria have been met.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(d) In the event that contamination is found at any time when carrying out the approved development that&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;was not previously identified it must be reported in writing immediately to the Local Planning Authority. An&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;investigation and risk assessment must be undertaken in accordance with the requirements of (a), and where&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;remediation is necessary a remediation scheme must be prepared in accordance with the requirements of (b),&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;which is subject to the approval in writing of the Local Planning Authority.
