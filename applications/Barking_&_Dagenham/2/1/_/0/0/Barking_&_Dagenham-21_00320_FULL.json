The contents of the scheme are subject to the approval in writing of the Local Planning Authority. The investigation and risk assessment must be undertaken by competent persons and a written report of the findings must be produced. The written report is subject to the approval in writing of the Local Planning Authority. The report of the findings must include:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol style=&quot;list-style-type:lower-roman&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:11pt&quot;&gt;a survey of the extent, scale and nature of contamination;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:11pt&quot;&gt;an assessment of the potential risks to human health; property (existing or proposed) including buildings, crops, livestock, pets, woodland and service lines and pipes; adjoining land; groundwaters and surface waters; ecological systems; archaeological sites and ancient monuments; and&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:11pt&quot;&gt;an appraisal of remedial options, and proposal of the preferred option(s). &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:11pt&quot;&gt;This must be conducted in accordance with DEFRA and the Environment Agency’s ‘Model Procedures for the Management of Land Contamination, CLR 11’; and&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol start=&quot;2&quot; style=&quot;list-style-type:lower-alpha&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:11pt&quot;&gt;a detailed&amp;nbsp;remediation scheme, to bring the site to a condition suitable for the intended use by removing unacceptable risks to human health, buildings and other property and the natural and historical environment, has been prepared and submitted to the Local Planning Authority for approval in writing. The scheme must include all works to be undertaken, proposed remediation objectives and remediation criteria, timetable of works and site management procedures. The scheme must ensure that the site will not qualify as contaminated land under Part 2A of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 in relation to the intended use of the land after remediation. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:11pt&quot;&gt;(c) The approved remediation scheme must be carried out in accordance with its terms prior to commencement of the development, other than that required to carry out remediation, unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority. The Local Planning Authority must be given two weeks written notification of commencement of the remediation scheme works.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:11pt&quot;&gt;Following completion of measures identified in the approved remediation scheme, a verification report that demonstrates the effectiveness of the remediation carried out must be produced and is subject to the approval in writing of the Local Planning Authority.
