    "&lt;p&gt;The proposed front extension and front porch, by reason of their design and massing would appear unduly prominent in relation to the existing dwellinghouse and would alter the established building line and balanced frontage of the semi-detached pair and row.&amp;nbsp; As such, the proposed development is considered to disrupt the uniformity of the existing dwellinghouse and the semi-detached pair,&amp;nbsp; and would harm the unique architectural make-up of the Becontree Estate. The proposal is therefore contrary to the following development plan policies:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- National Planning Policy Framework (MHCLG, February 2019);&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Policies D1, D4, D8, HC1 of The London Plan (March 2021);&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Policies CP2 and CP3 of the LDF Core Strategy (July 2010);&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Policies BP2, and BP11 of the LDF Borough Wide Development Plan Policies DPD (March 2011);&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- The Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document (February 2012);&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Policies SP2, DMD1, DMD4 and SPP6 of the Draft Local Plan (Regulation 19 Consultation version, October 2020)&lt;/p&gt;",
    "&lt;p&gt;The proposed double storey side and single storey garage extensions represent uncharacteristic and unsympathetic additions to the existing dwellinghouse. The single storey side garage will protrude beyond the principle elevation of the existing dwellinghouse and as such would appear unduly prominent and incongruous in relation to the existing dwellinghouse . Further, its projection beyond the established building line will detriment the sense of access and approach to the dwelling and would disrupt the uniformity of the semi-detached pair and the surrounding street scene.&amp;nbsp;The proposed extension will also compromise the openness on the corner which is distinctive of the Becontree Estate. The proposal is therefore contrary to the following:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- National Planning Policy Framework (MHCLG, February 2019);&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Policies D1, D4, D8, HC1 of The London Plan (March 2021);&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Policies CP2 and CP3 of the LDF Core Strategy (July 2010);&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Policies BP2, and BP11 of the LDF Borough Wide Development Plan Policies DPD (March 2011);&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- The Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document (February 2012);&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Policies SP2, DMD1, DMD4 and SPP6 of the Draft Local Plan (Regulation 19 Consultation version, October 2020)&lt;/p&gt;"
