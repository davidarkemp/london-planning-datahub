    "&lt;p&gt;The proposed double storey rear extension, by reason of its design, siting and unsympathetic roof form would would appear awkward and disjointed and would not respect or reflect the character and appearance of the existing dwelling and surrounding built environment.&amp;nbsp; As such, the proposed development is considered contrary to:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- National Planning Policy Framework (MHCLG, February 2019);&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Policies D1, D4, D8 of The London Plan (March 2021);&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Policy CP3 of the LDF Core Strategy (July 2010);&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Policy BP11 of the LDF Borough Wide Development Plan Policies DPD (March 2011);&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- The Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document (February 2012);&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Policies SP2, DMD1 and DMD6 of the Draft Local Plan (Regulation 19 Consultation version, October 2020&lt;/p&gt;",
    "&lt;p&gt;Notwithstanding reason 1,&amp;nbsp; the proposed extension is intended to rationalise and expand the layout of the existing dwelling through the provision of appropriately sized and lit home extensions. However, Officers note that the proposed two first floor rear bedrooms would be extremely cramped in size, with neither exceeding 4.00 sqm in size. This would represent poor design, detrimental to the standard of living for current and future residents.&lt;/p&gt;",
    "&lt;p&gt;The scale, siting and design of the proposed development would result in an increased sense of overbearingness and a harmful loss of outlook and daylight to neighbouring occupiers, therefore constituting unneighbourly development and contrary to:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- National Planning Policy Framework (MHCLG, February 2019);&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Policy 7.6 of The London Plan (March 2016);&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Policies BP8 and BP11 of the LDF Borough Wide Development Plan Policies DPD (March 2011);&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- The Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document (February 2012);&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Policies DMD1 and DMD6 of the Draft Local Plan (Regulation 19 Consultation version, October 2020)&lt;/p&gt;"
