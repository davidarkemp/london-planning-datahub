    "&lt;p&gt;The proposed&amp;nbsp;digital display board,&amp;nbsp; by reason of it&#x27;s prominent size, dominance and proximity to the highway would present further clutter to it&#x27;s surroundings which is detrimental to both the existing character of the area and to amenity of both those who would pass and view the proposed advertisement. Further, the sign will draw attention of the public away from the ground floor establishments on the parade and will further erode the quality of the streetscape, detrimental to visual amenity, contrary to:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- The NPPF (2019);&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Policies D1, D4, D8 and HC1 of The London Plan (2016);&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Policy CP3 of the LDF Core Strategy (2010);&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Policies BP7, BP8 and BP11 of the LFD Borough Wide DPD (2011);&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Draft Policies SP4, DMD1 and DMD7 of the Draft Local Plan Reg 19 (2020).&lt;/p&gt;",
    "&lt;p&gt;The proposed rear terrace area, by reason of its mass, bulk and overall design and siting is considered to be an incongruous addition to the site. The structure would not respect the character of the existing premises, nor would it have regard to the established local character as it would be unsympathetically located within a rear car park below residential units. Furthermore, the development would generate a significant increase in noise and general disturbance to neighbouring residents in the units above the application site which is considered unneighbourly and contrary to the following:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-&amp;nbsp; National Planning Policy Framework (MHCLG, February 2019);&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Policies D1, D4, D8, of The London Plan (March 2021);&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Policies CP2 and CP3 of the LDF Core Strategy (July 2010);&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Policies BP8 and BP11 of the LDF Borough Wide Development Plan Policies DPD (March 2011);&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- The Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document (February 2012);&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Policies SP2, DMD1, DMD4 and SPP6 of the Draft Local Plan (Regulation 19 Consultation version, October 2020)&lt;/p&gt;"
