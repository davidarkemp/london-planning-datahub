    "&lt;p&gt;The proposed outbuilding by reason of excessive scale presents a discordant feature which introduces an element of incongruous built form, resulting in a disruption to the garden setting which is considered harmful to the appearance of the house and character of the area. Further, by reason of its excessive scale, the outbuilding will result in an increased sense of overbearingness to neighbouring occupiers at No.266 Westrow Drive, therefore constituting unneighbourly development and contrary to:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- National Planning Policy Framework (MHCLG, February 2019);&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Policies D1, D4 of the London Plan (March 2021);&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Policies SP 2, DMD 1 and DMD 6 of the Draft Local Plan (Regulation 19 Consultation Version, October 2020);&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Policy CP3 of the LDF Core Strategy (July 2010);&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Policies BP8 and BP11 of the LDF Borough Wide Development Plan Policies DPD (March 2011);&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- The Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document (February 2012).&lt;/p&gt;",
    "&lt;p&gt;The proposed outbuilding would comprise a kitchen and bathroom which would therefore add elements that would present a future use well beyond a use ancillary to the residential dwelling. The proposed development would lead itself to forming a part of the primary accommodation onsite, rather than merely incidental use to the dwelling and as such is contrary to:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- National Planning Policy Framework (MHCLG, February 2019);&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Policies D1, D4 of the London Plan (March 2021);&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Policies SP 2, DMD 1 and DMD 6 of the Draft Local Plan (Regulation 19 Consultation Version, October 2020);&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Policy CP3 of the LDF Core Strategy (July 2010);&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Policies BP8 and BP11 of the LDF Borough Wide Development Plan Policies DPD (March 2011);&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- The Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document (February 2012).&lt;/p&gt;"
