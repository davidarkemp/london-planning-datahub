    "&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:11pt&quot;&gt;The proposed canopy for reasons of size, scale, design and sitting fails to respect and reflect the character of the host dwelling given it will appear disproportionately large and at odds with the character and appearance of the building.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Likewise, the design of the canopy exceeds that of a traditional roof canopy but falls short of an extension to the host building as such it will appear out of place at this location harmful to the character and appearance of the site. It is noted that there are canopy details missing given the external area has an outdoor kitchen which would have a flue, however, this is not shown in the proposed drawings, as such it is unclear what the relationship between this flue and the canopy is.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Additionally,&amp;nbsp;given significant development has already been carried out on the site some of which has resulted in the&amp;nbsp;loss of an important historical feature characteristic to the building detrimental to its visual appearance. Hence, with the retention of the existing canopy in addition to already unacceptable development will greater exacerbate the harm caused to the character and appearance of the area. This impact is notable given the site is a locally listed building, located within a conservation area and in the setting of a Grade II listed building and scheduled ancient monument. The proposal therefore constitutes an uncharacteristic and unsympathetic addition to the property, as such, it is considered unacceptable and contrary to the development policies.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",
    "&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:11pt&quot;&gt;The&amp;nbsp;proposed canopy will operate for longer hours than the existing pub. Given this outdoor area has its own drinks bar and kitchen area and as events are advertised for music, shisha, grills and games. It is considered the extended hours will generate more noise, waste, light, comings and goings, smells and general disturbances than currently produced by the site harmful to the standard of living of current and future residents of neighbouring properties. The proposal therefore constitutes unneighbourly development as such it is considered unacceptable and contrary to the development policies.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;"
