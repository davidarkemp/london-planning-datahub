    "&lt;p&gt;1. The proposed hip to gable loft conversion including a rear dormer window for reasons of design fails to respect and reflect the built form of the host dwelling as it introduces a new gabled roof design at this location detrimental to the symmetry of the terrace row. Likewise, the proposal seeks to increase the height of the properties ridge unbalancing the uniformity of the roof scape harmful to the visual apperance of the street scene. The proposal therefore constitutes an uncharacteristic and unsympathetic addition to the dwellinghouse detrimental to the character and appearance of the street scene, property, terrace row and the surrounding local area. The impact on the character and appearance of the area is notable given the sites location within the Becontree Estate. The proposal is therefore considered contrary to:- National Planning Policy Framework (MHCLG, February 2019) Policies D1, D4, D8 and HC1 of the London Plan (March 2021) Policies CP3 and CP2 of the Core Strategy DPD (July 2010) Policies BP11 and BP2 of the Borough Wide DPD (March 2011) Policies SP2, SP4, DMD1, DMD4 and DMD6 of the Draft Local Plan Regulation 19 consultation version (October 2020) The above policies can be viewed on the Council&#x27;s website: www.lbbd.gov.uk/planning.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;"
