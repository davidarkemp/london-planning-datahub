The cycle parking&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;space must be safe and easily accessible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cycle parking spaces should be designed and laid out in accordance with the&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;guidance contained in the London Cycling Design Standards, this means;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; access for residents only, and with stands/racks allowing both the frame and&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;at least one wheel to be secured&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Well located: close to the entrance of the property and avoiding obstacles&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;such as stairs, multiple doors, narrow doorways (less than 1.2 metres wide)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;and tight corners&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Covered&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fully accessible, for parking all types of cycle&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Managed, where possible, in order for access to be administered and to&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;provide ongoing maintenance&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prior to the approval of this application, applicant must identify adequate cycle&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;parking spaces.&lt;/p&gt;",

The contents of the scheme are subject to the approval in writing of the&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Local Planning Authority. The investigation and risk assessment must be undertaken by competent persons and a&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;written report of the findings must be produced. The written report is subject to the approval in writing of the Local&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Planning Authority. The report of the findings must include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(i) a survey of the extent, scale and nature of contamination;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(ii) an assessment of the potential risks to human health; property (existing or proposed) including buildings,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;crops, livestock, pets, woodland and service lines and pipes; adjoining land; groundwaters and surface&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;waters; ecological systems; archaeological sites and ancient monuments; and&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(iii) an appraisal of remedial options, and proposal of the preferred option(s).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This must be conducted in accordance with DEFRA and the Environment Agency’s ‘Land Contamination Risk&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Management (LCRM)’; and&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(b) a detailed remediation scheme, to bring the site to a condition suitable for the intended use by removing&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;unacceptable risks to human health, buildings and other property and the natural and historical environment, has&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;been prepared and submitted to the Local Planning Authority for approval in writing. The scheme must include all&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;works to be undertaken, proposed remediation objectives and remediation criteria, timetable of works and site&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;management procedures. The scheme must ensure that the site will not qualify as contaminated land under Part 2A&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 in relation to the intended use of the land after remediation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(c) The approved remediation scheme must be carried out in accordance with its terms prior to commencement of&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;the development, other than that required to carry out remediation, unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Planning Authority. The Local Planning Authority must be given two weeks written notification of commencement&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;of the remediation scheme works.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following completion of measures identified in the approved remediation scheme, a verification report that&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;demonstrates the effectiveness of the remediation carried out must be produced and is subject to the approval in&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;writing of the Local Planning Authority. The report shall include results of sampling and monitoring carried out to&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;demonstrate that the site remediation criteria have been met.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(d) In the event that contamination is found at any time when carrying out the approved development that&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;was not previously identified it must be reported in writing immediately to the Local Planning Authority. An&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;investigation and risk assessment must be undertaken in accordance with the requirements of (a), and where&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;remediation is necessary a remediation scheme must be prepared in accordance with the requirements of (b),&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;which is subject to the approval in writing of the Local Planning Authority. Following completion of measures&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;identified in the approved remediation scheme a verification report must be prepared, which is subject to the&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;approval in writing of the Local Planning Authority.&lt;/p&gt;",
    "&lt;p&gt;In addition, the new residential properties will need to be sufficiently protected from commercial noise near by. The Tollgate Grill appears to have a “beer garden” in close proximity to the proposal. Therefore, the following condition is necessary, and may require significant mitigation measures to achieve the&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;required standard:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scheme of Acoustic Protection&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prior to commencement of residential units, full details of a scheme of acoustic protection of habitable rooms&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;against noise shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority. The scheme of acoustic&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;protection shall be sufficient to secure internal noise levels no greater than:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;a. 35 dB LAeq in living rooms and bedrooms (07:00 hours to 23:00 hours) with windows closed; and&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;b. 30 dB LAeq in bedrooms (23:00 hours to 07:00 hours) with windows closed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, where the internal noise levels will exceed 40 dB LAeq in living rooms and bedrooms (07:00 hours to&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;23:00 hours) or 35dB LAeq in bedrooms (23:00 hours to 07:00 hours) with windows open the scheme of acoustic&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;protection shall incorporate a ventilator system which is commensurate with the performance specification set out&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;in Schedule 1 (paragraphs 6 and 7) of The Noise Insulation Regulations 1975 (as amended), and the Acoustic&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ventilation and Overheating Residential Design Guide January 2020. The approved scheme shall be fully&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;implemented before the first occupation of the residential unit to which it relates and shall be maintained at all&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;times thereafter.&lt;/p&gt;"
