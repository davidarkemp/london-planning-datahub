    "The development hereby permitted shall not be occupied until the 4 cycle parking spaces within the building have been fully implemented.  Thereafter, the cycle parking facilities shall be permanently retained for the duration of the development.\n\nMinor amendments may be agreed in writing from time to time by the Local Planning Authority.",
    "The development hereby approved shall only be carried out in accordance with the following approved plans and documents:- DRAWING XXX REV XX DATED XX- USE [SHIFT]+[ENTER] FOR REGULAR LINE SPACING- USE [ENTER] FOR LARGER LINE SPACINGNo other drawings or documents apply.",
    "The materials to be used in the construction of the external surfaces of the development hereby permitted shall match those used in the existing dwellinghouse.",
    "The development hereby permitted shall be commenced before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.",
    "Prior to commencement of residential units, full details of a scheme of acoustic protection of habitable rooms against noise shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority. The scheme of acoustic protection shall be sufficient to secure internal noise levels no greater than:a. 35 dB LAeq in living rooms and bedrooms (07:00 hours to 23:00 hours) with windows closed; andb. 30 dB LAeq in bedrooms (23:00 hours to 07:00 hours) with windows closed.Additionally, where the internal noise levels will exceed 40 dB LAeq in living rooms and bedrooms (07:00 hours to 23:00 hours) or 35dB LAeq in bedrooms (23:00 hours to 07:00 hours) with windows open the scheme of acoustic protection shall incorporate a ventilator system which is commensurate with the performance specification set out in Schedule 1 (paragraphs 6 and 7) of The Noise Insulation Regulations 1975 (as amended), and the Acoustic Ventilation and Overheating Residential Design Guide January 2020. The approved scheme shall be fully implemented before the first occupation of the residential unit to which it relates and shall be maintained at all times thereafter.",
    "No above ground new development shall commence until a scheme of noise insulation of party construction between the new residential units and the commercial use has been submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority. The approved scheme shall be fully implemented before the first occupation of the non-residential / residential unit(s) to which it relates.",
    "Noise from the non-residential uses hereby permitted, including, but not limited to, live and amplified music shall be controlled so as to be inaudible inside adjoining and other noise-sensitive premises in the vicinity of those uses. The initial test for compliance with the ‘inaudibility’ criterion will be that noise should be no more than barely audible outside those noise-sensitive premises. In the event there is disagreement as to whether such noise is or is not audible the following numerical limits shall be used to determine compliance with this condition:the LAeq (CUAN) shall not exceed LA90 (WCUAN); andthe L10 (CUAN) shall not exceed L90 (WCUAN) in any 1/3 octave band between 40Hz and 160Hz.CUAN = Commercial/Community Use Activity Noise Level, WCUAN = representative background noise level without commercial/community use activity noise, both measured 1 meter from the façade of the noise-sensitive premises.The combined rating level of the noise from any plant installed pursuant to this permission (other than plant which is only to be operated in emergency circumstances) shall not exceed the existing background noise level outside the window to any noise-sensitive room. Any assessment of compliance in this regard shall be made according to the methodology and procedures presented in BS4142:2014.Any machinery and equipment installed pursuant to this permission shall be designed and installed to ensure that structure borne (re-radiated) noise emissions shall not exceed 35 LAeq dB (5 min) when measured in any habitable room in adjoining residential premises."
