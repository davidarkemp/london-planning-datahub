    "&lt;p&gt;The proposed side extension for reasons of design fails to respect and reflect the character and appearance of the host\r\nproperty as it introduces a new roof design at this location. Likewise, for reasons of size, scale and sitting the proposed rear\r\nextension will appear disproportionately large in comparison to the host property, therefore, it will appear at odds with the\r\ncharacter and appearance of the dwelling, terrace row and surrounding local area. The proposal therefore constitutes\r\nuncharacteristic and unsympathetic development, as such, it is considered unacceptable and contrary to:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-\r\nNational Planning Policy Framework (MHCLG, February 2019)\r\nPolicies D1, D4 and D8 of the London Plan (March 2021)\r\nPolicy CP3 of the Core Strategy DPD (July 2010)\r\nPolicy BP11 of the Borough Wide DPD (March 2011)\r\nPolicies SP2, SP4, DMD1 and DMD6 of the Draft Local Plan Regulation 19 consultation version (October 2020)\r\nSupplementary Planning Document: Residential Extensions and Alterations (March 2012)&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",
