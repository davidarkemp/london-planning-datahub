In the event there is disagreement as to whether such noise is or is not audible the following numerical limits shall be used to determine compliance with this condition:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• the LAeq (CUAN) shall not exceed LA90 (WCUAN); and&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• the L10 (CUAN) shall not exceed L90 (WCUAN) in any 1/3 octave band between 40Hz and 160Hz.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CUAN = Commercial/Community Use Activity Noise Level, WCUAN = representative background noise level without commercial/community use activity noise, both measured 1 metre from the façade of the noise-sensitive premises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The combined rating level of the noise from any plant installed pursuant to this permission (other than plant which is only to be operated in emergency circumstances) shall not exceed the existing background noise level outside the window to any noise-sensitive room. Any assessment of compliance in this regard shall be made according to the methodology and procedures presented in BS4142:2014.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any machinery and equipment installed pursuant to this permission shall be designed and installed to ensure that structure borne (re-radiated) noise emissions shall not exceed 35 LAeq dB (5 min) when measured in any habitable room in adjoining residential premises.&lt;/p&gt;",
