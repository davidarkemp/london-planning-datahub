    "&lt;p&gt;The proposed double storey front, side and rear extensions, by reason of their mass, scale and sitting would harm the symmetrical character and appearance of the host dwelling and the semi-detached pair, and would be at odds with the wider character of the street scene. The proposed quantum of development will add significant bulk and massing to the existing dwellinghouse and would therefore represent a considerable over-development of the site. As such the proposed development is contrary to the following policies:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) (2021);&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Policies D1, D4 and D8 of the London Plan (2021);&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Policy CP3 of the&amp;nbsp;Local Development Framework (LDF) Core Strategy (July 2010);&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Policy BP11 of the LDF Borough Wide Development Plan Policies DPD (March 2011);&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Policies DMD1 and DMD6 of the Draft Local Plan (Regulation 19 Consultation version, October 2020);&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- The Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document (February 2012);&lt;/p&gt;"
