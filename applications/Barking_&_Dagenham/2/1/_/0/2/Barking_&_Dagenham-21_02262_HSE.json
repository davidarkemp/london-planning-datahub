    "&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:11pt&quot;&gt;The proposed first floor rear extension will extend beyond a 45 degree angle as measured from the adjoining property. As such, the proposal is considered to result in the material loss of daylight, outlook and privacy and constitute an overbearing and unneighbourly development harmful to the standard of living of current and future residents of nos. 570. The proposal is considered unacceptable and contrary to the development policies.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",
    "&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:11pt&quot;&gt;The proposed first floor side and rear extension for reasons of size, scale, design and sitting fails to respect and reflect the built form and character of the dwellinghouse and terrace row as it introduces a new building frontage and roof design. Additionally, the proposal will close off the gap between the two properties detrimental to the character and appearance of the street scene. The proposal is considered an uncharacteristic and unsympathetic addition to the dwellinghouse. The impact on the character of the area is notable given the sites location within the Becontree Estate. The proposal is considered unacceptable and contrary to the development policies.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;"
