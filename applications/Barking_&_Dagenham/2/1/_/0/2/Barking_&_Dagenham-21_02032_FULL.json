    "No development above ground level shall take place until details of refuse enclosures showing the design; location and external appearance have been submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority. The refuse and recycling collection and storage should be collected from the narrow access road. The approved enclosures shall be provided before the commencement of the use and thereafter permanently retained.Reason: To provide satisfactory refuse storage provision in the interests of the appearance of the site.",
    "Scheme of Acoustic ProtectionPrior to commencement of residential units, full details of a scheme of acoustic protection of habitable rooms against noise shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority. The scheme of acoustic protection shall be sufficient to secure internal noise levels no greater than:a. 35 dB LAeq in living rooms and bedrooms (07:00 hours to 23:00 hours) with windows closed; andb. 30 dB LAeq in bedrooms (23:00 hours to 07:00 hours) with windows closed.Additionally, where the internal noise levels will exceed 40 dB LAeq in living rooms and bedrooms (07:00 hours to 23:00 hours) or 35dB LAeq in bedrooms (23:00 hours to 07:00 hours) with windows open the scheme of acoustic protection shall incorporate a ventilator system which is commensurate with the performance specification set out in Schedule 1 (paragraphs 6 and 7) of The Noise Insulation Regulations 1975 (as amended), and the Acoustic Ventilation and Overheating Residential Design Guide January 2020. The approved scheme shall be fully implemented before the first occupation of the residential unit to which it relates and shall be maintained at all times thereafter.Reason: To ensure that the proposed residential units are adequately protected from noise.9. ",
    "Contaminated LandNo development shall commence until:(a) an investigation and risk assessment, in addition to any assessment provided with the planning application, has been completed in accordance with a scheme to assess the nature and extent of any contamination on the site,  whether or not it originates on the site. The contents of the scheme are subject to the approval in writing of the Local Planning Authority. The investigation and risk assessment must be undertaken by competent persons and a written report of the findings must be produced. The written report is subject to the approval in writing of the Local Planning Authority. The report of the findings must include:(i) a survey of the extent, scale and nature of contamination;(ii) an assessment of the potential risks to human health; property (existing or proposed) including buildings, crops, livestock, pets, woodland and service lines and pipes; adjoining land; groundwaters and surface waters; ecological systems; archaeological sites and ancient monuments; and(iii) an appraisal of remedial options, and proposal of the preferred option(s).This must be conducted in accordance with DEFRA and the Environment Agency’s ‘Land Contamination Risk Management (LCRM)’; and(b) a detailed remediation scheme, to bring the site to a condition suitable for the intended use by removing unacceptable risks to human health, buildings and other property and the natural and historical environment, has been prepared and submitted to the Local Planning Authority for approval in writing. The scheme must include all works to be undertaken, proposed remediation objectives and remediation criteria, timetable of works and site management procedures. The scheme must ensure that the site will not qualify as contaminated land under Part 2A of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 in relation to the intended use of the land after remediation.(c) The approved remediation scheme must be carried out in accordance with its terms prior to commencement of the development, other than that required to carry out remediation, unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority. The Local Planning Authority must be given two weeks written notification of commencement of the remediation scheme works.Following completion of measures identified in the approved remediation scheme, a verification report that demonstrates the effectiveness of the remediation carried out must be produced and is subject to the approval inwriting of the Local Planning Authority. The report shall include results of sampling and monitoring carried out to demonstrate that the site remediation criteria have been met.(d) In the event that contamination is found at any time when carrying out the approved development that was not previously identified it must be reported in writing immediately to the Local Planning Authority. An investigation and risk assessment must be undertaken in accordance with the requirements of (a), and where remediation is necessary a remediation scheme must be prepared in accordance with the requirements of (b), which is subject to the approval in writing of the Local Planning Authority. Following completion of measures identified in the approved remediation scheme a verification report must be prepared, which is subject to the approval in writing of the Local Planning Authority.Reason: Contamination must be identified prior to commencement of development to ensure that risks from land contamination to the future users of the land and neighbouring land are minimised, together with those to controlled waters, property and ecological systems, and to ensure that the development can be carried out safely without unacceptable risks to workers, neighbours and other off-site receptors",
    "Prior to commencement of the development, a construction logistics plan (CLP) in line with the TfL guidelines shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the Council. The details shall include the numbers, size and routes of construction vehicles, provisions within/around the site to ensure that all vehicles associated with the construction works are properly managed to prevent any unwanted disruption to other highway users, and other matters relating to traffic management to be agreed with the licencing officers of the council. Approved details shall be implemented throughout the project period and any changes to the document must be reported back to the council’s planning and highways department.Reason: To ensure that appropriate steps are taken to limit the impact of the proposed demolition and construction works on the operation of the public highway, the amenities of local residents and the area generally.",
    "Prior to occupation of the development, details shall be submitted to the Local Planning Authority demonstrating a minimum of 4 cycle parking spaces which shall be laid out on site. The submission should include details of the security, monitoring and access arrangements for the cycle parking facilities. The development shall not be occupied until the approved details have been implemented. Thereafter, the cycle parking facilities shall be permanently retained.Reason: In the interests of promoting cycling as a safe, efficient and non-polluting mode of transport.",
    "The scheme shall make provision for 2 car parking spaces in a location to be agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority and shall be constructed and marked out prior to the occupation of the development, and thereafter retained permanently for the accommodation of vehicles of occupiers and visitors to the premises and not used for any other purpose.Reason: To ensure that sufficient off-street parking areas are provided and not to prejudice the free flow of traffic or conditions of general safety along the adjoining highway.",
    "The development shall be constructed in accordance with the external materials shown on DRAWING NO. XXX and to the satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority.",
    "The development hereby approved shall only be carried out in accordance with the following approved plans and documents:- DRAWING XXX REV XX DATED XX- USE [SHIFT]+[ENTER] FOR REGULAR LINE SPACING- USE [ENTER] FOR LARGER LINE SPACINGNo other drawings or documents apply.",
    "The development hereby permitted shall be commenced before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission."
