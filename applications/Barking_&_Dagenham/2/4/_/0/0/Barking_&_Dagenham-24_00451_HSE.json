    "<div>The proposed development, by reasons of scale and siting, would cause severe harm to the neighbouring occupiers. Specifically, the proposed development would unacceptably result in a material loss of outlook and privacy to 29/30 Walfrey Gardens, and an overbearing impact on 27 &amp; 29/30 Walfrey Gardens and 127 &amp; 129 Hedgemans Road. It would therefore constitute unneighbourly development and be contrary to:</div><div><br></div><div><p>- National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) (DLUHC, 2023); </p><p>- Policies D4/8 of the London Plan (March 2021); </p><p>- Policy CP3 of the London Borough of Barking and Dagenham’s Local Development Framework (LDF) Core Strategy (July 2010); </p><p>- Policy BP8 of the London Borough of Barking and Dagenham’s Borough Wide Development Plan Document (DPD) (March 2011); </p><p>- Policies DMD1 and DMD6 of the London Borough of Barking and Dagenham’s Draft Local Plan (Reg 19 Submission Ver., December 2021); and </p><p>- The London Borough of Barking and Dagenham’s Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD (February 2012).<br></p></div>",
    "<p>The proposed development, by reason of its scale, siting and design, would not appear subservient to the original dwelling and would represent an overly dominant addition, which is considered to be disproportionately large in relation to the scale of the existing dwellinghouse. Further, it would fail to respect the established character and symmetry of the terrace row, at the end of the banjo cul-de-sac, a distinct characteristic feature of the Becontree Estate. By closing the gap between terrace rows, it would also result in an increased sense of enclosure on this corner plot and would be visible from key public vantage points within the street. It would therefore result in unacceptable harm to visual amenity and fail to preserve the key characteristics of this non-designated heritage asset. Therefore, the proposed development is contrary to: </p><p>- National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) (DLUHC, 2023); </p><p>- Policies D1/4 &amp; HC1 of the London Plan (March 2021); </p><p>- Policies CP2/3 of the London Borough of Barking and Dagenham’s Local Development Framework (LDF) Core Strategy (July 2010); </p><p>- Policies BP2/11 of the London Borough of Barking and Dagenham’s Local Development Framework (LDF) Borough Wide Development Plan Document (DPD) (March 2011); </p><p>- Policies SP2/4, SPP6 &amp; DMD1/4/6 of the London Borough of Barking and Dagenham’s Draft Local Plan (Reg 19 Submission Ver., December 2021); and </p><p>- The London Borough of Barking and Dagenham’s Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD (February 2012).<br></p>"
