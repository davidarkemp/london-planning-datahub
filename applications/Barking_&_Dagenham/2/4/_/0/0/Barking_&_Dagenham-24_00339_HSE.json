    "By reason of the siting, scale, bulk and massing of the proposed development, in addition to the cumulative impact of the overall additions to the dwellinghouse, the proposed development will unduly dominate the dwelling which will no longer reflect the character of the original dwellinghouse. The development will result in harm to the appearance of the house and impact the openness of the corner plot, resulting in harm to the streetscene and character of the area, especially noting the siting within the Becontree Estate. Additionally, the proposed development will significantly reduce the useable amenity space at the dwelling, reducing the quality of accommodation at the site. As such, the proposed development is contrary to:&nbsp;National Planning Policy Framework National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) (DLUHC, December 2023)Policy D4 of the London Plan (March 2021)Policy CP2 and CP3 of the Local Development Framework (LDF) Core Strategy (July 2010)Policies BP8 and BP11 of the Local Development Framework (LDF) Borough Wide Development Plan Document (DPD) (March 2011)The Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document (February 2012)Policies SP2, DMD1 and DMD6 of The London Borough of Barking and Dagenhamâ€™s Draft Local Plan: (Regulation 19 Submission Version, December 2021)"
