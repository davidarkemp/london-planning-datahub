    "The proposed development, by reason of siting, scale, mass\r\nand design, would be an unsympathetic addition which would be at odds with the surrounding built form, would fail to reflect the roof form and detailing of the original dwelling, would have an awkward relationship with the neighbouring dwelling and would be excessive in width compared with the original dwelling. This would cause harm to\r\nthe character and appearance of the original dwelling and surrounding area. The\r\nproposal is therefore found to be at odds with the following policies which\r\nseek to ensure that development proposals have regard to the existing\r\ncharacter:\r\n\r\n\r\n National Planning Policy Framework (December 2023)\r\n Policy D4 London Plan (March 2021)\r\n Policy CP3 of the&nbsp;Local Development Framework Core\r\n     Strategy (July 2010)\r\n Policies&nbsp;BP8 and BP11 of the&nbsp;Local Development\r\n     Framework Borough Wide Development Plan Document (March 2011)\r\n Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary\r\n     Planning Document (February 2012)\r\n Policies SP2 and DMD6 of&nbsp;The London Borough of\r\n     Barking and Dagenhamâ€™s Draft Local Plan: (Regulation 19 Submission\r\n     Version, December 2021)\r\n"
