    "The proposed extension, by reason of siting and design, would be an undesirable addition which would remove a distinctive feature from the front elevation, which currently contributes positively to the character of the Becontree Estate and to the rhythm and symmetry of the terrace row. As such, it would fail to respect or reflect the character and appearance of the original dwelling, terrace row, street scene along Valence Wood Road and wider Becontree Estate, causing harm to each of these as well as to the local distinctiveness and historic character of the Becontree Estate. The proposal is thus contrary to the following policies which seek to ensure that developments are sympathetic to local character and history: National Planning Policy Framework (December 2023) Policies D4 and HC1 of the London Plan (March 2021) Policies CP2 and CP3 of the&nbsp;Local Development Framework Core Strategy (July 2010) Policies BP2, BP8 and BP11 of the&nbsp;Local Development Framework Borough Wide Development Plan Document (March 2011) Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document (February 2012) Policies SP2, DMD4 and DMD6 of&nbsp;The London Borough of Barking and Dagenhamâ€™s Draft Local Plan: Regulation 19 Submission Version (December 2021)"
