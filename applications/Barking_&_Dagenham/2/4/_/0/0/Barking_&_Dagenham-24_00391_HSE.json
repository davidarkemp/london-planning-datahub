    "The proposed development, by reason of scale, siting and design, would appear overly dominant when compared with the original dwelling,&nbsp; would feature an incongruous roof form, would result in the loss of openness to a characteristic gap at a prominent corner plot, would disrupt the surrounding pattern of development and would unbalance the semi-detached pair, detracting from the characteristic &#39;book-end&#39; typology. As such, the proposal would cause undue harm to the character and appearance of the host dwelling and surrounding area. The proposal is thus contrary to the following policies which seek to ensure that development recognises local character and promotes good design whilst protecting and enhancing historic environments: National Planning Policy Framework (December 2023) Policies D1 and D4 of the London Plan (March 2021)Policies CP2 and CP3 of the Local Development Framework (LDF) Core Strategy (July 2010)Policies BP2, BP8 and BP11 of the Local Development Framework (LDF) Borough Wide Development Plan Document (DPD) (March 2011) Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document (February 2012) Policies SP 2 and DMD 1 of The London Borough of Barking and Dagenhamâ€™s Draft Local Plan: (Regulation 19 Submission Version, December 2021"
