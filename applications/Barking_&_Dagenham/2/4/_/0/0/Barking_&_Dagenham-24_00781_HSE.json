    "The proposed development, by reason of siting, scale and design, reduces the positive contribution of Heathway House on the street scene along Longbridge Road, reduces the openness of the street scene, fails to provide an active frontage within its town centre location, and fails to be constructed of high quality materials which reflect the host building. It therefore fails to respect or reflect the surrounding character and appearance, fails to promote the vitality and viability of the town centre and fails to preserve or enhance the historic environment, causing harm to each of these. The proposal is thus found to be at odds with the following policies:&nbsp;\r\n National Planning Policy Framework (December 2023)\r\n Policies D1, D4, HC1 and SD6 of the London Plan (March 2021)\r\n Policies CP2, CP3 and CE1 of the&nbsp;Local Development Framework Core\r\n     Strategy (July 2010)\r\n Policies BP2, BP8, BP11 and BE2 of the&nbsp;Local Development\r\n     Framework Borough Wide Development Plan Document (March 2011)\r\n Policies SP2, DMD1, DMD4, DMD6 and DME3 of&nbsp;The London Borough of\r\n     Barking and Dagenhamâ€™s Draft Local Plan: (Regulation 19 Submission\r\n     Version, December 2021)Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document (February 2012)\r\n"
