    "The proposal, by reason of siting, scale, design and massing, would relate poorly to the original dwelling, would result in a discordant roofscape, would disrupt the built form of the terrace and would cause further loss to the open aspect of the corner plot. The impact would be visible along both Ford Road and Comyns Road, causing harm to the appearance of the original dwelling and terrace row and to the character and historic distinctiveness of the surrounding area. The proposal is therefore at odds with the following policies, which taken together seek to ensure that development recognises local character and promotes good design whilst protecting and\r\nenhancing historic environments.\r\n National Planning\r\n     Policy Framework (December, 2023)\r\n Policies D4 and HC1 of\r\n     the London Plan (March 2021)\r\n Policies\r\n     CP2 and CP3 of the&nbsp;Local Development Framework Core Strategy\r\n     (July 2010)\r\n Policies BP2, BP8\r\n     and BP11 of the&nbsp;Local Development Framework Borough Wide\r\n     Development Plan Document (March 2011)\r\n Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary\r\n     Planning Document (February 2012)\r\n Policies\r\n     SP2, DMD4 and DMD6 of&nbsp;The London Borough of Barking and Dagenhamâ€™s Draft\r\n     Local Plan: (Regulation 19 Submission Version, December 2021)\r\n"
