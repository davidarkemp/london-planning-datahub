    "The proposed development, by reason of siting, scale, mass and\r\ndesign, would be an overly bulky, discordant addition which would fail to appear subordinate and sympathetic to the original dwelling and would have an awkward relationship with the existing dormer window. This would cause harm to the character and appearance of the original dwelling and surrounding area. The proposal is therefore found to be at odds with the\r\nfollowing policies which seek to ensure that development proposals have regard to the existing character:\r\n\r\n\r\n National Planning Policy Framework (December 2023)\r\n Policy D4 London Plan (March 2021)Policy CP3 of the&nbsp;Local Development Framework Core Strategy\r\n     (July 2010)\r\n Policies&nbsp;BP8 and BP11 of the&nbsp;Local Development\r\n     Framework Borough Wide Development Plan Document (March 2011)\r\n Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary\r\n     Planning Document (February 2012)\r\n Policies SP2 and DMD6 of&nbsp;The London Borough of\r\n     Barking and Dagenhamâ€™s Draft Local Plan: (Regulation 19 Submission\r\n     Version, December 2021)\r\n"
