    "&lt;p&gt;The proposed development, by reason of siting, scale, mass and design, would be an overly bulky, discordant addition which would appear overly dominant, disrupt the rhythm of the street, would result in the loss of open aspect to the corner plot, would result in the loss of original features and proportions, would unbalance the terrace row and would fail to reflect the existing roofscape. This would cause unacceptable harm to the character and appearance of the original dwelling and surrounding area. The proposal is therefore found to be at odds with the following policies which seek to ensure that development proposals are well-designed and have regard to the existing character: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;National Planning Policy Framework (December 2023) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Policy D4 London Plan (March 2021) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Policy CP3 of the&amp;nbsp;Local Development Framework Core Strategy (July 2010) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Policies&amp;nbsp;BP8 and BP11 of the&amp;nbsp;Local Development Framework Borough Wide Development Plan Document (March 2011) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document (February 2012) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Policies SP2 and DMD6 of&amp;nbsp;The London Borough of Barking and Dagenhamâ€™s Draft Local Plan: (Regulation 19 Submission Version, December 2021)&lt;/p&gt;"
