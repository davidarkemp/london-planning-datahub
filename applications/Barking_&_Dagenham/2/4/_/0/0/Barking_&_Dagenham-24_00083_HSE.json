    "&lt;p&gt;The proposal, by reason of bulk, mass, scale, siting and design, would be an undesirable addition which would not appear subservient to the original dwelling and would&amp;nbsp;unbalance the symmetry and uniformity of the dwelling with the adjacent semi-detached twin. Further, it would close&amp;nbsp;off the corner plot and bringing forward the building line at a prominent junction, posing potential harm on the highway.&amp;nbsp; As such, it fails to respect or reflect the character of the original dwelling, the semi-detached pair of which it forms a part, and the surrounding area, causing harm to each of these as well as to the street scene along Croppath Road and Hunters Square , notably given the location of the application site within the Becontree Estate. As such, the proposed development is contrary to:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Paragraphs 131, 135, 203, 209 of the National Planning Policy Framework &amp;nbsp;(NPPF) (DLUHC, December 2023)&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Policies&amp;nbsp;D4 and HC1 of the London Plan (March 2021)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Policies CP2 and CP3 of the Local Development Framework (LDF) Core Strategy (July 2010)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Policies BP2, BP8 and BP11 of the Local Development Framework (LDF) Borough Wide Development Plan Document (DPD) (March 2011)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Policies SP2, DMD1, DMD4 and DMD6 of The London Borough of Barking and Dagenhamâ€™s Draft Local Plan: (Regulation 19 Submission Version, December 2021)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document (February 2012)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;"
