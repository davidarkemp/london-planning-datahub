    "\r\n The proposed development, by reason of siting, design, mass and bulk, would disrupt the surrounding pattern of development as a discordant addition and would be at odds with the character of the surrounding dwellings. It therefore fails to represent a high quality design, and would have a detrimental impact on the character and appearance of the surrounding area, as well as to the local distinctiveness of the Becontree Estate, a non-designated heritage asset. The proposal thus fails to comply with the following policies which seek to ensure development proposals are sympathetic to local character and appearance and preserve or enhance the local distinctiveness and historic character:National Planning Policy Framework&nbsp;(NPPF) (DLUHC, 2023)\r\n Policies D4 and HC1 of the London Plan (March 2021)\r\n Policies CP2 and CP3 of\r\n     the&nbsp;Local Development Framework Core Strategy (July 2010)\r\n Policy BP11 of the&nbsp;Local Development Framework Borough Wide\r\n     Development Plan Document (March 2011)\r\n Policies SP2, DMD1 and DMD4 of&nbsp;The London Borough of Barking and Dagenham’s Draft\r\n     Local Plan: (Regulation 19 Submission Version, December 2021)\r\n",
