The measurement value shall be adjusted to remove the additional sound energy contribution from reflected surfaces other than from the ground.b. The plant shall be supported on adequate proprietary anti-vibration mounts in perpetuity, to reduce the structural transmission of vibration and regenerated noise within adjoining premises.&nbsp;",
