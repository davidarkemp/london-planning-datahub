    "The proposed development, by reason of siting, scale, mass and design, would be a substantially bulky, discordant addition which would&nbsp;would appear overly dominant and not have regard to the original built form of the host dwelling and the area.&nbsp;It would introduce a substantial bulk and massing to the host dwelling at roof level. It would not appear subservient to the host dwelling and would introduce an incongruity among the already approved elements. It would present a significant addition to the dwelling and present a third-storey appearance.&nbsp;The proposal is therefore found to be at odds with the following policies which seek to ensure that development proposals have regard to the existing character:National Planning Policy Framework National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) (December, 2023)Policy D4 of the London Plan (March 2021)The Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document (February 2012)Policies SP2, DMD1 and DMD6 of The London Borough of Barking and Dagenhamâ€™s Draft Local Plan: (Regulation 19 Submission Version, December 2021)"
