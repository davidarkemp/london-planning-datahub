Specifically the application lacks clarity and provides contradictory information. It also fails to demonstrate the shift timings/arrangements, visitor arrangements, the age range of proposed residents and severity of the mental health and disbilities of these residents therefore the overall impact on comings and goings, parking, noise etc cannot be assessed adequately."
