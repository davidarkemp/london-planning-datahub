    "The proposal presents an undesirable addition which would cause unacceptable overshadowing, loss of daylight and outlook and an overbearing impact to neighbouring occupiers, particularly no.65 and no.67 Hardwicke Street. This would result in a harmful impact to the amenity currently enjoyed by neighbouring occupiers. As such, it fails to protect residential amenity and constitutes un-neighbourly development. The proposal fails to accord with the following policies which seek to ensure that development proposals protect residential amenity:Paragraph 135 of the National Planning Policy Framework&nbsp;National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) (December, 2023)Policy D6 of the London Plan (March 2021)Sections 4.2&nbsp;and 5.3 of the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document (February 2012)Policies DMD1 and DMD5 of&nbsp;The Barking and Dagenham Local Plan (September, 2024)"
