    "<p>The proposal, especially the side element of the proposals, by reason of siting, scale and appearance, would create an undesirable addition to the street scene, which would disrupt the symmetry across the terrace row and create a visual impact at the entrance of Amidas Gardens, also would close off the openness of the corner plot and would disrupt the built form of a 'banjo' styled cul-de-sac. As a result, it fails to respect or reflect the character of the original dwelling, terrace row and surrounding area, and fails to respect, preserve or enhance the local distinctiveness of the Becontree Estate. It would have a harmful impact on each of these, as well as on the street scene along Marlborough Road and Amidas Gardens. The proposal is thus contrary to the following policies which seek to ensure that development is of a high quality, respectful to local character and appearance, and sympathetic to the historic character: </p><p>- National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) (DLUHC, 2023); </p><p>- Policies D1/8 &amp; HC1 of the London Plan (March 2021);</p><p>- Policies SPP6 &amp; DMD1/4/5 of the London Borough of Barking and Dagenham’s Local Plan (September 2024); and </p><p>- The London Borough of Barking and Dagenham’s Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document (February 2012)</p>"
