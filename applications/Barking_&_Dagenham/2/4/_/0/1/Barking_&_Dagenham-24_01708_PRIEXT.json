    "The proposal, by reason of siting and scale,&nbsp;presents an undesirable addition which would cause an unacceptable loss of daylight and outlook and an overbearing impact to neighbouring dwellings.&nbsp;This would result in a harmful impact to the amenity currently enjoyed by neighbouring occupiers, to such an extent that this constitutes undue harm. As such, the proposal fails to protect residential amenity and constitutes un-neighbourly development. The proposal therefore fails to accord with the following policies which seek to ensure that development proposals protect residential amenity:National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) (December, 2024)Policy D6 of the London Plan (March 2021)Sections 4.2&nbsp;and 5.3 of the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document (February 2012)Policies DMD1 and DMD5 of&nbsp;The Barking and Dagenham Local Plan (September, 2024)"
