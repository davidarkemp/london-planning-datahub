    "<div>The proposed development, by reason of siting, mass and design, would present a discordant addition which would disrupt the rhythm of the street, and would result in the loss of open aspect to the corner plot.

The incongruous roof forms in combination with the existing dormer extension would be in conflict with one another and result in further discordance which would imbalance the terrace row.&nbsp;The proposal is therefore found to be at odds with the following policies which seek to ensure that development proposals have regard to the existing character:</div><div><br></div><div><ul><li style=\"\">National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) (December 2023)</li><li style=\"\">Policy D4 of the London Plan (March 2021)</li><li style=\"\">Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document (February 2012)</li><li style=\"\">Policies SP2, DMD1 and DMD5 of The Barking and Dagenham Local Plan (September&nbsp;2024)</li></ul></div>"
