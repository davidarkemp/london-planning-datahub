    "Prior to first-use of the Air Source Heat Pump, a scheme shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority (LPA) which demonstrates that the following noise design requirements can be complied with:a. The cumulative measured or calculated rating level of noise emitted from the mechanical services plant to which the application refers, shall be lower than the existing background noise level by 5dB at all times when the plant is in operation. Measurements shall be made at a height of 1.2 â€“ 1.5 metres above the adjacent ground level and at least 3.5 metres from any sound reflecting surfaces other than the ground or 1 metre from the facade of the nearest first floor (or higher) noise sensitive premises, and in accordance with the latest British Standard BS4142:2014. The measurement value shall be adjusted to remove the additional sound energy contribution from reflected surfaces other than from the ground. An alternative position for assessment /measurement may be used to allow ease of access, this must be shown on a map and noise propagation calculations detailed to show how the design criteria were achieved. b. The plant shall be supported on adequate proprietary anti-vibration mounts to reduce the structural transmission of vibration and regenerated noise within adjoining premises. The approved scheme shall be retained thereafter.",
