  "decision_conditions": [
    "Before the development is commenced a detailed site investigation shall be carried out to establish if the site is contaminated, to assess the degree and nature of the contamination present, and to determine its potential for the pollution of the water environment.  The method and extent of this site investigation shall be agreed with the Planning Authority prior to commencement of the work.  Details of appropriate measures to prevent pollution of the ground water and surface water, including provisions for monitoring, shall then be submitted to and approved in writing by the Planning Authority before development commences.  The development shall then proceed in strict accordance with the measures approved.\r \rReason:\rTo prevent pollution of the water environment and in order to quantify any hazards already existing on the site in accordance with Policy G28 of the Unitary Development Plan.",
    "Surface water drainage works and source control measures shall be carried out in accordance with details, which should be submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority before development commences.\r \rReasons:\rTo prevent the increased risk of flooding.",
    "No development approved by this permission shall be commenced until the Local Planning Authority is satisfied that adequate sewerage infrastructure will be in place to receive foul water discharges from the site.  No buildings (or uses) hereby permitted shall be occupied (or commenced) until such infrastructure is in place.\r \rReason:\rTo ensure that the foul water discharge from the site shall not be prejudicial to the existing sewerage system and the amenities of the area.",
    "No building hereby permitted shall be occupied until a green travel plan has been submitted to and approved by the Local Planning Authority. The green travel plan should outline proposals to minimise car-borne trips and encourage the use of public transport and, once approved, should thereafter be maintained and reviewed.\r \rReason:\rTo encourage the alternatives to the private car as a means of accessing the site in the interests of sustainability and minimising pollution emissions.",
    "No development shall take place until the applicant has secured the implementation of a programme of archaeological work in accordance with a written scheme for investigation which has been submitted by the applicant and approved by the Local Planning Authority.  The development shall only take place in accordance with the detailed scheme pursuant to this condition.  The archaeological works shall be carried out by a suitably qualified investigating body acceptable to the Local Planning Authority.\r \rReason:\rTo safeguard the heritage of the Borough by providing an adequate opportunity to investigate and excavate archaeological remains on the site before development is carried out in accordance with Policy DE36 and 37 of the Unitary Development Plan and in accordance with PPG16.",
    "All Parts of the development, including the car parks and all external circulation areas shall be designed to be accessible to people with disabilities in accordance with details submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority.\r \rReason:\rIn the interest of providing easier access within the development to people with disabilities.",
    "The development shall not commence until details of any proposed to reduce the potential for crime have been submitted to and approved by the Local Planning Authority.\r \rReason:\rTo protect the amenities of the locality by avoiding light pollution and reducing the potential for crime related activity in accordance with Policy DE6 and C16 of the Unitary Development Plan.",
    "No development shall take place until details of existing and finished site levels, finished floor and ridge levels of the buildings to be erected, and finished external surface levels have been submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority.\r \rReason:\rTo ensure that any works in connection with the development hereby permitted respect the height of adjacent properties.",
    "The siting, size and dimensions of the vehicular access to the site shall be to the satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority.\r \rReason:\rTo ensure that the access is satisfactory in terms of highway safety and in accordance with Policy T.27 of the Unitary Development Plan.",
    "The development hereby permitted shall not be commenced until details of the parking layout and surfacing materials for the site have been submitted to and approved by the Local Planning Authority.\r \rReason:\rTo ensure that sufficient off-street parking areas are provided and not to prejudice the free flow of traffic on the adjoining highway and in accordance with Policy T.13 of the Unitary Development Plan.",
    "A minimum of 5% of the agreed car parking spaces shall be reserved for disabled users with blue badges in accordance with a scheme to be submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority.  The allocated spaces shall be carefully positioned and designed in accordance with BS8300.\r \rReason:\rTo ensure that the approved development does not prejudice the free flow of the traffic or conditions of general safety along the neighbouring highway in accordance with Policy T27 of the Unitary Development Plan.",
    "The approved development shall make provision for cycle parking in accordance with a scheme that shall have been previously submitted to approved by the Local Planning Authority.\r \rReason:\rIn the interests of promoting cycling as a safe, efficient and non-polluting mode of transport and in accordance with Policy T.19 of the Unitary Development Plan.",
    "The development shall not commence until details of pedestrian footpaths have been submitted to and approved by the Local Planning Authority and thereafter permanently retained.\r \rReason:\rIn the interest of highway safety.",
    "The development shall not commence until detail of refuse enclosures have been submitted to and approved by the Local Planning Authority and thereafter permanently retained for the use of the occupiers of the premises.\r \rReason:\rTo provide satisfactory refuse storage provision in the interest of the appearance of the site and locality in accordance with the requirements of Policy G32",
    "The development shall not be commenced until details of all boundary fences and walls have been submitted to and approved by the Local Planning Authority and no part of the development shall be occupied until the approved fences and walls for that part have been provided.  The approved fences and walls shall be retained unless the Local Planning Authority gives prior written approval to their removal.\r \rReason:\rTo ensure the satisfactory means of enclosure for the proposed development in the interests of the visual amenity of the area."
