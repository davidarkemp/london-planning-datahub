The design shall satisfy criteria to limit obtrusive light presented in Table 1, p25 of the guide, relating to Environmental Zone E3 - Medium district brightness areas - small town centre or urban locations.\n\nReason: In the interests of security and safety, to avoid light pollution and safeguard neighbouring amenity and in accordance with policy BP11 of the Borough Wide Development Policies Development Plan Document.",
    "A Phase 2 investigation and risk assessment, in addition to the Phase 1 assessment provided with the planning application, must be completed in accordance with a scheme to assess the nature and extent of any contamination on the site, whether or not it originates on the site. The contents of the scheme are subject to the approval in writing of the Local Planning Authority. The investigation and risk assessment must be undertaken by competent persons and a written report of the findings must be produced. The written report is subject to the approval in writing of the Local Planning Authority. The report of the findings must include: \n\na.\ta survey of the extent, scale and nature of contamination; \n\nb.\tan assessment of the potential risks to: \ni.     human health, \nii.     property (existing or proposed) including buildings, crops, livestock, pets, woodland and service lines and pipes, \niii.     adjoining land, \niv.     groundwaters and surface waters, \nv.     ecological systems, \nvi.     archaeological sites and ancient monuments; \n\nc.\tan appraisal of remedial options, and proposal of the preferred option(s). \n\nd.\tThis must be conducted in accordance with DEFRA and the Environment Agency's 'Model Procedures for the Management of Land Contamination, CLR 11'.",
    "A detailed remediation scheme to bring the site to a condition suitable for the intended use by removing unacceptable risks to human health, buildings and other property and the natural and historical environment must be prepared, and is subject to the approval in writing of the Local Planning Authority. The scheme must include all works to be undertaken, proposed remediation objectives and remediation criteria, timetable of works and site management procedures. The scheme must ensure that the site will not qualify as contaminated land under Part 2A of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 in relation to the intended use of the land after remediation.",
    "The approved remediation scheme must be carried out in accordance with its terms prior to the commencement of development other than that required to carry out remediation, unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority. The Local Planning Authority must be given two weeks written notification of commencement of the remediation scheme works.",
    "In the event that contamination is found at any time when carrying out the approved development that was not previously identified it must be reported in writing immediately to the Local Planning Authority. An investigation and risk assessment must be undertaken in accordance with the requirements of condition 25, and where remediation is necessary a remediation scheme must be prepared in accordance with the requirements of condition 26, which is subject to the approval in writing of the Local Planning Authority.\n\nReason for Conditions 25-28: Contamination must be identified prior to commencement of development to ensure that risks from land contamination to the future users of the land and neighbouring land are minimised, together with those to controlled waters, property and ecological systems, and to ensure that the development can be carried out safely without unacceptable risks to workers, neighbours and other off-site receptors in accordance with policy BR5 of the Borough Wide Development Policies Development Plan Document and policy 5.21 of the London Plan.",
    "Unless the maximum depth of any part of the foundations is less than two metres, details of the design of the foundations and other works proposed below existing ground level shall be submitted in writing prior to the start of construction and approved by the Local Planning Authority in consultation with HS1. Construction activity shall then be carried out in compliance with the approved details unless previously agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority in consultation with HS1.\n\nReason: Details are required prior to the commencement of development in order to reduce the impact to ground works in proximity to HighSpeed1, and to ensure that loads on, and settlement of, HighSpeed1 tunnels, structures, track and other infrastructure do not prejudice the safety or operation of HighSpeed1.",
    "Prior to the start of site investigations involving a borehole or trial pit deeper than one metre, details of the location and depth of site investigations including a method statement shall be submitted in writing and  approved by the Local Planning Authority in consultation with HS1. This activity shall then be carried out only in compliance with the approved details unless previously agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority in consultation with HS1.\n\nReason: No such information has been provided and is required in order that the borehole or trial pit is at an acceptable vertical and horizontal distance from the tunnel such that it does not compromise the integrity, safety or operation of HighSpeed1.",
    "Prior to the start of construction activity engineering details of the size, depth and proximity to HighSpeed1 of any excavations shall be submitted in writing to and approved by the Local Planning Authority in consultation with HS1. Excavations shall then be carried out in accordance with the approved details unless the Local Planning Authority in consultation with HS1 has previously agreed in writing to any change.\n\nReason: No such details have been provided.  To ensure that the stability HighSpeed1 tunnels, structures, track and other infrastructure is not prejudiced.",
    "Prior to the start of construction, details of the size, loading and proximity to HighSpeed1 of additional ground loads such as stockpiles shall be submitted in writing and approved by the Local Planning Authority in consultation with HS1. Works shall be carried out in conformity with the approved details unless the Local Planning Authority in consultation with HS1 has previously agreed in writing to any change \n\nReason: To ensure that the stability of HighSpeed1 tunnels, structures, track and other infrastructure is not prejudiced.",
    "Prior to the start of construction details of the plant and equipment proposed which are likely to give rise to vibration (such as pile driving, demolition and vibro-compaction of the ground) together with predicted vibration levels, shall be submitted in writing and approved by the Local Planning Authority in consultation with HS1.  Activities likely to cause vibration in the vicinity of HighSpeed1 infrastructure such that a peak particle velocity (PPV) of 5mm/s may be exceeded at the railway boundary will be subject to agreement in advance.\n\nWhere activities could give rise to PPV of 5mm/s or greater, a vibration and settlement monitoring regime shall be submitted in writing to for approval by the Local Planning Authority in consultation with HS1.  It shall be put in place prior to the start of works.  HS1 shall be provided reasonable access to the results of monitoring\n\nReason: No details of vibration have been provided.  To ensure that vibration does not prejudice safety, operation and structural integrity of HighSpeed1.",
    "No development above ground level shall take place until a scheme showing the provisions to be made for CCTV coverage has been submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority. The development shall not be occupied until the approved scheme has been implemented. Thereafter the approved measures shall be permanently retained unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority.\n\nReason: In order to provide a good standard of security to future occupants and visitors to the site and to reduce the risk of crime in accordance with policy BP11 of the Borough Wide Development Policies Development Plan Document."
