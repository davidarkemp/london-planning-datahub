    "Noise from entertainment including live and amplified music associated with the restaurant/bar use hereby permitted shall be controlled so as to be inaudible inside adjoining and other noise-sensitive premises in the vicinity of the restaurant/bar. The initial test for compliance with the 'inaudibility' criterion will be that noise should be no more than barely audible outside those noise-sensitive premises.  In the event there is disagreement as to whether entertainment noise is or is not audible the following numerical limits shall be used to determine compliance with this condition:\r\rthe LAeq (EN) shall not exceed LA90 (WEN); and\rthe L10 (EN) shall not exceed L90 (WEN) in any 1/3 octave band between 40Hz and 160Hz.\r\rEN = entertainment noise level and WEN = representative background noise level without the entertainment noise; both measured 1 metre from the façade of the noise-sensitive premise.\r\rReason:  To ensure that noise-sensitive premises in the vicinity of the development are adequately protected from noise and in accordance with policy BR13 of the Borough Wide Development Policies Development Plan Document and policy 7.15 of the London Plan.",
