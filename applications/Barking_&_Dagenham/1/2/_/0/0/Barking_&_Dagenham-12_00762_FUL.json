    "Within three months of the date of this permission and prior to commencement of the proposed front extension, a scheme of design and construction measures to safeguard the existing warehouse and the proposed front extension against the possible ingress of ground gas shall be submitted to the Local Planning Authority for approval in writing.  The approved scheme shall be fully implemented prior to the occupation of the proposed front extension.  If further remedial measures are required to the existing warehouse these shall be carried out in accordance with the approved scheme within a period of time  to be agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority. The scheme shall incorporate measures which achieve a combined gas protection score of 2 as detailed in Table 3 of BS8485:2007 \"Code of practice for the characterization and remediation from ground gas in affected developments\".\r\rReason:  To ensure that risks from land contamination to the future users of the land are minimised in accordance with policy BR5 of the Borough Wide Development Policies Development Plan Document.",
