    "The development permitted shall be begun before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.\r\rReason:\rTo comply with Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended by S.51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act  2004)",
    "The development hereby permitted shall be carried out in accordance with the following approved plans: ^IN;\r\rReason: For the avoidance of doubt and in the interests of proper planning.",
    "The car parking areas indicated on drawing No. 2-002 Rev. E shall be constructed and marked out prior to the occupation of the development, and thereafter retained permanently for the accommodation of vehicles of occupiers and visitors to the premises and not used for any other purpose.\r\rReason:  To ensure that sufficient off-street parking areas are provided and not to prejudice the free flow of traffic or conditions of general safety along the adjoining highway in accordance with policy BR9 of the Borough Wide Development Policies Development Plan Document.",
    "The extended unit shall be used initially for any purpose falling within Class B1(c) of the Town and Country Planning (Use Classes) Order 1987 (as amended) or in any provision equivalent to that Class in any statutory instrument revoking and re-enacting that Order or, following the exercise of permitted development rights, any purpose within Class B8 of the Order. The unit shall not be used for purposes within Class B1(a) and (b) of the Order. \r\rReason: \r\rIn order to :\r\r(a) prevent a change of use to Use Class B1 (a) and (b) which is likely to result in an increased number of employees at the site and a consequent increase in traffic movements and parking demand to the detriment of the successful operation of the industrial estate and in accordance with policies BR9 and BR10 of the Borough Wide Development Policies Development Plan Document and;\r\r(b) ensure that any future use of the site for offices, which are a main town centre use as defined in the National Planning Policy Framework, is subject to proper consideration through the submission of a sequential test."
