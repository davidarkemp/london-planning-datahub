The details shall accord with the advice set out in \"Biodiversity for Low and Zero Carbon Buildings: A Technical Guide for New Build\" (Published by RIBA, March 2010) or similar advice from the RSPB and the Bat Conservation Trust.\r\rReason:  In order to preserve and enhance the Borough's natural environment and to comply with policy CR2 of the Core Strategy, policy BR3 of the Borough Wide development Policies Development Plan Document and policy 7.19 of the London Plan.",
    "Before occupation all of the dwellings shall comply with Building Regulations Optional Requirement Approved Document M4(2) Category 2: Accessible and adaptable dwellings (2015 edition). Evidence of compliance shall be notified to the building control body appointed for the development in the appropriate Full Plans Application, or Building Notice, or Initial Notice to enable the building control body to check compliance.\r\rReason:  To ensure that accessible housing is provided in accordance with policy 3.8 of the Minor Alterations to the London Plan.",
    "An investigation and risk assessment, in addition to any assessment provided with the planning application, must be completed in accordance with a scheme to assess the nature and extent of any contamination on the site, whether or not it originates on the site.  The contents of the scheme are subject to the approval in writing of the Local Planning Authority.  The investigation and risk assessment must be undertaken by competent persons and a written report of the findings must be produced.  The written report is subject to the approval in writing of the Local Planning Authority.  The report of the findings must include: \r\r(i)   a survey of the extent, scale and nature of contamination; \r\r(ii)  an assessment of the potential risks to: \r\ro\t\thuman health, \ro\t\tproperty (existing or proposed) including buildings, crops, livestock, pets, woodland and service lines and pipes, \ro\t\tadjoining land, \ro\t\tgroundwaters and surface waters, \ro\t\tecological systems, \ro\t\tarchaeological sites and ancient monuments; \r\r(iii) an appraisal of remedial options, and proposal of the preferred option(s). \r\rThis must be conducted in accordance with DEFRA and the Environment Agency's 'Model Procedures for the Management of Land Contamination, CLR 11'.",
    "Where required, a detailed remediation scheme to bring the site to a condition suitable for the intended use by removing unacceptable risks to human health, buildings and other property and the natural and historical environment must be prepared, and is subject to the approval in writing of the Local Planning Authority.  The scheme must include all works to be undertaken, proposed remediation objectives and remediation criteria, timetable of works and site management procedures.  The scheme must ensure that the site will not qualify as contaminated land under Part 2A of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 in relation to the intended use of the land after remediation.",
    "The approved remediation scheme must be carried out in accordance with its terms prior to the commencement of development other than that required to carry out remediation, unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority.  The Local Planning Authority must be given two weeks written notification of commencement of the remediation scheme works.\r\rFollowing completion of measures identified in the approved remediation scheme, a verification report that demonstrates the effectiveness of the remediation carried out must be produced, and is subject to the approval in writing of the Local Planning Authority.",
    "In the event that contamination is found at any time when carrying out the approved development that was not previously identified it must be reported in writing immediately to the Local Planning Authority.  An investigation and risk assessment must be undertaken in accordance with the requirements of condition 21, and where remediation is necessary a remediation scheme must be prepared in accordance with the requirements of condition 22, which is subject to the approval in writing of the Local Planning Authority.\r\rFollowing completion of measures identified in the approved remediation scheme a verification report must be prepared, which is subject to the approval in writing of the Local Planning Authority in accordance with condition 23.",
    "Where indicated by the remediation strategy a monitoring and maintenance scheme to include monitoring the long term effectiveness of the proposed remediation, and the provision of reports on the same must be prepared, both of which are subject to the approval in writing of the Local Planning Authority.\r\rReason for Conditions 21 to 25:  To ensure that risks from land contamination to the future users of the land and neighbouring land are minimised, together with those to controlled waters, property and ecological systems, and to ensure that the development can be carried out safely without unacceptable risks to workers, neighbours and other off-site receptors in accordance with Policy BR5 of the Borough Wide Development Policies Development Plan Document.",
