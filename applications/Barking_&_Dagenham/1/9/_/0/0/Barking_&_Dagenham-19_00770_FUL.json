    "The proposed development by virtue of its siting, location, unexemplary design and high density will be a stark, crude and isolated development in the town centre that is piecemeal in nature and represents poor place-making which will unduly impact on the setting of the Grade II listed former Barking Magistrates Court, does not seek to preserve or enhance the character of the Abbey and Barking Town Centre Conservation Area and does not maximise opportunities within the key regeneration area of Barking Town Centre and as such would be contrary to policies CM1, CM2 and CP3 of the Core Strategy, policies BTC16 and BTC19 of the Barking Town Centre Area Action Plan, policy BP11 of the Borough Wide Development Policies Development Plan Document, London Plan policies 3.4, 7.4, 7.6 and 7.7, draft London Plan policies D1, D4, D3, D9, HC1, SD1 and the London Riverside Opportunity Area Planning Framework.",
    "The proposed first floor flats on the south-western elevation facing Grove Place will be separated from the flank wall of 32 East Street by a distance of only 6 metres resulting in poor outlook from the proposed flats, detrimental to the amenities enjoyed and living standards of future occupiers of the development, contrary to policies BP8 and BP11 of the Borough Wide Development Policies Development Plan Document.",
    "The proposed development will result in the loss of sunlight and daylight to neighbouring residential occupiers and in particular flats contained within the former Barking Magistrates Court and the Bath House buildings.  The application has also failed to demonstrate that flats within the development and the courtyard area will receive adequate sunlight levels.  The proposal is considered to impact on the living standards of the neighbouring residential occupiers and potential occupiers of the proposed development, contrary to policies BP8 and BP11 of the Borough Wide Development Policies Development Plan Document.",
    "The proposed development by virtue of the first floor internal layout will result in four isolated residential units which provides an uninviting and poor quality environment and represents poor design for potential residents contrary to policy BTC16 of the Barking Town Centre Area Action Plan, policy BP11 of the Borough Wide Development Policies Development Plan Document, London Plan policy 3.5 and draft London Plan policies D1 and D6.",
    "The application has failed to demonstrate that sufficient children's playspace provision will be provided for the development and as such will be detrimental to the living standards and amenities enjoyed by future occupants of the development, contrary to London Plan policy 3.6, draft London Plan policy S4 and the Mayor's Shaping Neighbourhoods: Play and Informal Recreation Supplementary Planning Guidance.",
    "The location of the proposed blue badge spaces is considered unsatisfactory, posing a potentially hazardous conflict with the existing turning head area on Clockhouse Avenue and the plant and refuse access to the former Barking Magistrates Court building, and as such is contrary to policies BR9 and BR10 of the Borough Wide Development Policies Development Plan Document and draft London Plan policies T6 and T6.1.",
    "The proposed application has not been accompanied by an adequate Archaeological Written Scheme of Investigation to inform Historic England of the impact of the design proposals on this Archaeological Priority Area, contrary to policy BP3 of the Borough Wide Development Policies Development Plan Document.",
    "The application has failed to provide details of the breakdown of the proposed affordable housing tenure and as such has not satisfactorily demonstrated that the proposal will accord with the Mayor's fast-track viability route, contrary to London Plan policies 3.10-3.13 and draft London Plan policies H4-H6."
