    "The development hereby permitted shall not be occupied until details of riparian life saving equipment as recommended by the Port of London Authority have been submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority in consultation with the Port of London Authority.  The life saving equipment shall be to a standard recommended in the Hayes Report on the Inquiry into River Safety and provided in accordance with the approved details prior to the occupation of any part of the development.  The life saving equipment shall be permanently retained to an acceptable standard.\n\nReason:  In the interests of public safety and to accord with policy BP9 of the Borough Wide Development Policies Development Plan Document.",
    "No development shall commence until two dusk or dawn bat surveys have been undertaken between 1 May and 1 September in accordance with the recommendations contained in the submitted Ecological Report dated 30 June 2017.  If the surveys find the building is being used by bats, a strategy to ensure the protection of the roost and/or hibernation site must be submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority before the commencement of works.\n\nReason:  Bats are a protected species and therefore the survey work and associated assessment must be completed prior to commencement of development and in accordance with policy CR2 of the Core Strategy.",
    "No more than two days prior to commencement of any works that may affect nesting birds (including river works, building work, roof works, tree works and vegetation clearance), buildings, river edges, trees and hedges shall be checked by a qualified ecologist to determine if nesting birds are present.  A report shall be submitted to the Local Planning Authority confirming the presence or absence of birds before the works commence.  If nesting birds are found, works should be delayed until the nesting season is over and the fledglings have left the area and a strategy should be agreed with the Local Planning Authority to ensure the nesting birds are not disturbed by any other works taking place on the site.\n\nReason:  In order to preserve and enhance the Borough's natural environment and to comply with policy CR2 of the Core Strategy, policy BR3 of the Borough Wide Development Policies Development Plan Document and policy 7.19 of the London Plan.",
    "The residential occupiers of the proposed development shall not be eligible for a parking permit within any adjoining Controlled Parking Zones (CPZ).\n\nReason:  To prevent residential occupiers of the proposed development from taking up parking spaces in adjoining CPZs which are already in high demand by existing local residents in accordance with Policies BR9 and BR10 of the Borough Wide Development Policies Development Plan Document.",
    "The combined rating level of the noise from any plant installed pursuant to this permission shall not exceed the existing background noise level outside the window to any noise-sensitive room.  Any assessment of compliance with this condition shall be made according to the methodology and procedures presented in BS4142:2014.\n\nReason:  To ensure that the proposed residential units are adequately protected from noise and in accordance with policy BR13 of the Borough Wide Development Policies Development Plan Document and policy 7.15 of the London Plan.",
    "Noise from entertainment including live and amplified music associated with the restaurant/bar use hereby permitted shall be controlled so as to be inaudible inside adjoining and other noise-sensitive premises in the vicinity of the restaurant/bar. The initial test for compliance with the 'inaudibility' criterion will be that noise should be no more than barely audible outside those noise-sensitive premises.  In the event there is disagreement as to whether entertainment noise is or is not audible the following numerical limits shall be used to determine compliance with this condition:\n\nthe LAeq (EN) shall not exceed LA90 (WEN); and\nthe L10 (EN) shall not exceed L90 (WEN) in any 1/3 octave band between 40Hz and 160Hz.\n\nEN = entertainment noise level and WEN = representative background noise level without the entertainment noise; both measured 1 metre from the façade of the noise-sensitive premise.\n\nReason:  To ensure that noise-sensitive premises in the vicinity of the development are adequately protected from noise and in accordance with policy BR13 of the Borough Wide Development Policies Development Plan Document and policy 7.15 of the London Plan.",
    "Other than with the prior written approval of the Local Planning Authority, the proposed restaurant/bar use is permitted to trade between the hours of 0800 to midnight Sunday to Thursday and 0800 to 0100 Friday and Saturday, and at no other time.  \n\nThe handling of bottles and movement of bins and rubbish is not permitted to take place outside the restaurant/bar between the hours of 2300 on one day and 0700 the following day.\n\nThe delivery/collection of goods associated with the restaurant/bar is only permitted to take place between the hours of 0700 and 2100 on any day.\n\nReason:  To ensure that the proposed residential units and neighbouring occupiers are adequately protected from noise and in accordance with policies BP8 and BR13 of the Borough Wide Development Policies Development Plan Document and policy 7.15 of the London Plan.",
    "Any machinery and equipment to be installed pursuant to this permission shall be designed and installed to ensure that structure borne (re-radiated) noise emissions shall not exceed 35 LAeq dB (5 min) when measured in any habitable room in adjoining residential premises.\n\nReason:  To ensure that the proposed residential units are adequately protected from noise and in accordance with policy BR13 of the Borough Wide Development Policies Development Plan Document and policy 7.15 of the London Plan."
