    "The proposed development by virtue of its scale, massing and design would be out of context with and imbalance the relationship with adjacent properties, resulting in the overdevelopment of the plot, detracting from the character of the surrounding area contrary to Policy CP3 of the Core Strategy, Policies BP8 and BP11 of the Borough Wide Development Policies DPD  and Policies BTC16 and BTC18 of the Barking Town Centre Area Action Plan Development Plan Document",
    "The proposed development by virtue of its height, design, layout and architectural treatment results in a poorly designed building that fails to respect or reflect the character and appearance of the surrounding area.  As such, the proposal fails to conform with policies CM1 and CP3 of the Core Strategy, Policies BTC16 and BTC18 of the Town Centre Area Action Plan and policy BP11 of the Borough Wide Development Policies Development Plan Document.",
    "The proposed development, due to its scale and siting, would be overbearing in appearance, resulting in a loss of daylight and sunlight to occupants of 2 Cranborne Road  and the overshadowing of the garden detrimental to the residential amenity of the occupants of this property contrary to policies BP8 and BP11 of the Borough Wide Development Policies Development Plan Document and the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document.",
    "The development fails to provide suitable and functional external amenity space for the twelve units and would by virtue of it's close proximity to the bedroom and lounge windows of flat 3 would llead to a loff of privacy to the occupants of this flat, and as such would be detrimental to the living standards and amenities enjoyed by future occupiers of these dwellings contrary to Policy BP5 of the Borough Wide Development Policies Development Plan Document (March 2011).",
    "The development fails to provide affordable housing and the applicant's financial viability appraisal has been independently reviewed and the development has been found to be in a surplus and would be able to support on-site affordable housing provision.  The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy 3.13 of the London Plan and the Mayor of London Homes for Londoners; Affordable Housing and Viability Supplementary Planning Guidance, August 2017.",
    "The proposed development does not provide a quality landscaping scheme to mitigate against and justify the loss of existing green space and trees on the application site which has the potential to support local wildlife and diversity, contrary to policy BR3 of the Borough Wide Development Policies Development Plan Document (March 2011).",
    "The access to flat 3 and the layout of the habitable rooms and bathrooms in flats 3, 6 and 10 are poorly designed and cramped, leading to poor quality amenity to these units and resulting in substandard units of accommodation, detrimental to the living standards and amenities enjoyed by existing and future occupiers and contrary to Policy 3.5 of the London Plan."
