The contents of the scheme are subject to the approval in writing of the Local Planning Authority.  The investigation and risk assessment must be undertaken by competent persons and a written report of the findings must be produced.  The written report is subject to the approval in writing of the Local Planning Authority.  The report of the findings must include:\n\n(I)\ta survey of the extent, scale and nature of contamination;\n(II)\tan assessment of the potential risks to human health; property (existing or proposed) including all receptors that may be affected including those off-site;\n(III)\tan appraisal of remedial options, and proposal of the preferred option(s). This must be conducted in accordance with DEFRA and the Environment Agency's 'Model Procedures for the Management of Land Contamination, CLR 11'. \n\nMinor amendments may be agreed from time to time in writing by the Local Planning Authority. \n\n(b)   a detailed remediation scheme, to bring the site to a condition suitable for the intended use by removing unacceptable risks to human health, buildings and other property and the natural and historical environment, has been prepared and submitted to the Local Planning Authority for approval in writing.  The scheme must include all works to be undertaken, proposed remediation objectives and remediation criteria, timetable of works and site management procedures.  The scheme must ensure that the site will not qualify as contaminated land under Part 2A of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 in relation to the intended use of the land after remediation. \n\nMinor amendments may be agreed from time to time in writing by the Local Planning Authority.\n\n(c)  The approved remediation scheme must be carried out in accordance with its terms prior to commencement of the development, other than that required to carry out remediation, unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority.  The Local Planning Authority must be given two weeks written notification of commencement of the remediation scheme works.\n\nFollowing completion of measures identified in the approved remediation scheme, a verification report that demonstrates the effectiveness of the remediation carried out must be produced and is subject to the approval in writing of the Local Planning Authority.  The report shall include results of sampling and monitoring carried out to demonstrate that the site remediation criteria have been met.\n\n(d)   In the event that contamination is found at any time when carrying out the approved development that was not previously identified it must be reported in writing immediately to the Local Planning Authority.  An investigation and risk assessment must be undertaken in accordance with the requirements of (a), and where remediation is necessary a remediation scheme must be prepared in accordance with the requirements of (b), which is subject to the approval in writing of the Local Planning Authority.  Following completion of measures identified in the approved remediation scheme a verification report must be prepared, which is subject to the approval in writing of the Local Planning Authority.\n\nReason:  Contamination must be identified prior to commencement of development to ensure that risks from land contamination to the future users of the land and neighbouring land are minimised, together with those to controlled waters, property and ecological systems, and to ensure that the development can be carried out safely without unacceptable risks to workers, neighbours and other off-site receptors in accordance with policy BR5 of the Borough Wide Development Policies Development Plan Document and policy 5.21 of the London Plan.",
