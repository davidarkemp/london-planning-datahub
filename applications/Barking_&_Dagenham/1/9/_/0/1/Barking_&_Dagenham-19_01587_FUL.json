    "The development permitted shall be begun before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.\r\rReason:\rTo comply with Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended by S.51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act  2004)",
    "The development hereby permitted shall be carried out in accordance with the following approved plans: ^IN;\r\rReason: For the avoidance of doubt and in the interests of proper planning.",
    "All external surfaces of the development shall be constructed using the materials shown on drawing PTK 00 GF DR A (20)001 Rev P03. Minor amendments may be agreed in writing from time to time by the Local Planning Authority.\r\rReason:  In order to protect or enhance the character and amenity of the area in accordance with policies BP8 and BP11 of the Borough Wide Development Policies Development Plan Document.",
    "The Construction Management Plan Version 1 prepared by Portakabin shall be adhered to throughout the construction period for the development.\r\rDemolition and construction work and associated activities, other than internal works not audible outside the site boundary, are only to be carried out between the hours of 08:00 and 18:00 Monday to Friday and 08:00 and 13:00 Saturday, with no work on Sundays or public holidays without the prior written permission of the Local Planning Authority.  Any works which are associated with the generation of ground borne vibration are only to be carried out between the hours of 08:00 and 18:00 Monday to Friday.\r\rDemolition and construction work and associated activities are to be carried out in accordance with the recommendations contained within British Standard 5228:2009, \"Code of practice for noise and vibration control on construction and open sites\", Parts 1 and 2.\r\t\rReason: In order to reduce the environmental impact of the construction and the impact on the amenities of neighbouring residents and in accordance with policy BP8 of the Borough Wide Development Policies Development Plan Document.",
    "In the event that contamination is found at any time when carrying out the approved development that was not previously identified it must be reported in writing immediately to the Local Planning Authority.  An investigation and risk assessment must be undertaken and where remediation is necessary a remediation scheme must be prepared, which is subject to the approval in writing of the Local Planning Authority.  Following completion of measures identified in the approved remediation scheme a verification report must be prepared, which is subject to the approval in writing of the Local Planning Authority.\r\rReason:  Contamination must be identified to ensure that risks from land contamination to the future users of the land and neighbouring land are minimised, together with those to controlled waters, property and ecological systems, and to ensure that the development can be carried out safely without unacceptable risks to workers, neighbours and other off-site receptors in accordance with policy BR5 of the Borough Wide Development Policies Development Plan Document and policy 5.21 of the London Plan.",
    "Prior to development above ground, a detailed drainage scheme with associated management and maintenance plan based on Sustainable Drainage principles shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority. The scheme shall subsequently be implemented in accordance with the approved details before the development is completed.\r\rReason: The Drainage Scheme is required in order to reduce the risk of flooding and in accordance with policy BR4 of the Borough Wide Development Policies Development Plan Document and policy 5.13 of the London Plan."
