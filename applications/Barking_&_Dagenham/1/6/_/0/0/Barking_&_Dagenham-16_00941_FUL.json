The investigation and risk assessment must be undertaken by competent persons and a written report of the findings must be produced.  The written report is subject to the approval in writing of the Local Planning Authority.  The report of the findings must include:\r\r(i)    a survey of the extent, scale and nature of contamination;\r(ii)   an assessment of the potential risks to human health; property (existing or proposed) including buildings, crops, livestock, pets, woodland and service lines and pipes; adjoining land; groundwaters and surface waters; ecological systems; archaeological sites and ancient monuments; and\r(iii)  an appraisal of remedial options, and proposal of the preferred option(s). \r\rThis must be conducted in accordance with DEFRA and the Environment Agency's 'Model Procedures for the Management of Land Contamination, CLR 11'.",
