    "The proposed three front dormers, by reason of their siting, and the proposed rear dormer, by reason of its size, scale, bulk, width and design and junction with the proposed ground floor rear extension, would result in a discordant and intrusive feature that would be detrimental to the character and appearance of the original dwelling and the visual amenities of the street scene and the wider area. Therefore, the proposal would be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021) and Chapter 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023)."
