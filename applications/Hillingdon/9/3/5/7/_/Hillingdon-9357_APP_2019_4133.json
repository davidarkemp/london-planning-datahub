  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed development, by reason of the plot coverage and layout, result in an overdevelopment of the site providing poor quality amenity space for future occupiers. In particular, Plots A, C and D (due to the very close proximity of trees which are required to be retained owing to their contribution to the streetscene) would have poor quality amenity spaces by reason of almost all of the rear gardens and significant parts of the plots being overshadowed by tree canopies contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One (November 2012), Policies DMHB 11 and DMHB 18 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policies 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan (2016) and Paragraph 127 of the NPPF (2019).",
    "The proposed development fails to indicate satisfactory refuse storage, management and collection arrangements for future residents contrary to Policies BE1 and EM11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One (November 2012), Policy DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and Policy 5.17 of the London Plan (2016).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan - The Spatial Development Strategy for London consolidated with alterations since 2011 (2016) and national guidance."
