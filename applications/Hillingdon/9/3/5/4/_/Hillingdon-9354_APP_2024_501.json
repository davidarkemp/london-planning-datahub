    "The cumulative impacts of the proposed extensions by reason of their combined and excessive scale, bulk, depth, width and size would result in an unsympathetic and incongruous over development of the site which would fail to read as subordinate to the original dwelling, harming the design and appearance of the host property and character and appearance of the streetsscene . Therefore, the proposal fails to comply with Policies BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHD 1, DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021) and Chapter 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023)."
