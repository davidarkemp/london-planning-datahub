  "description": "Single storey rear extension, raising of ridge height and conversion of roofspace to habitable use to include 2 x side dormers and ground floor infill extension.",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed development, by reason of the cumulative size, scale, bulk and design, including the half hipped roof design and side dormers,  would result in incongruous additions and alterations, which would would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original dwelling, would be detrimental to the character, appearance and the visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2016). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020.",
