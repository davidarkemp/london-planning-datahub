    "The proposed development, by reason of its size, scale, bulk, depth and design, including the disproportionate roof detail, represents an unduly intrusive and incongruous form of development, which would fail to harmonise with the character and appearance of the original dwelling and the wider area. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021) and the NPPF (2019).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service."
