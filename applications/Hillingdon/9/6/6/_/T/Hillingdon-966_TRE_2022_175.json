    "The Cedar and Horse Chestnut as situated within the front garden of St Raphaels Convent, with Court Drive frequently used as a cut through they are highly visible to many passers-by and residents, as a result they have high amenity values. They also significantly contribute to the arboricultural character of Hillingdon Court Park Area of Special Local Character (ASLC).",
    "The work for the Cedar is contradictory wishing to reduce the lateral spread by 1.5m but also stating that they will maintain the current width dimensions, the Cedars form is currently seen as appropriate for its location. The work proposed to the Horse Chestnut is seen as excessive and will lead to multiple wounds throughout the trees canopy which could lead to dysfunction and decline.",
    "Having regard to the reasons given for the proposed work, the work is unjustified and will have a detrimental impact on the visual amenity and arboreal character of the area.",
