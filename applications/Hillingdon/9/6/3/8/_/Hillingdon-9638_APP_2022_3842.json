    "The proposed side extension, by reason of its size, siting, proximity and bulk would give rise to a harmful loss of outlook and increased sense of enclosure to No.20 and No.21 Cowley Mill Road, failing to safeguard their amenities, contrary to Policies DMHD1 and DMHB11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two (2020).",
