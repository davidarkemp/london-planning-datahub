    "The proposed development inclusive of the raising of the eastern wall, by reason of its cumulative size, scale, bulk, massing, design, roof form, and height would appear as a disproportionate and incongruous form of development that would fail to harmonise with or be sympathetic to the architectural composition of the original dwelling, and would be detrimental to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the street scene. The development proposal would fail to preserve the appearance and character of the Harefield Village Conservation Area, resulting in less than substantial harm. There are no public benefits to outweigh the harm identified. Therefore the development proposal would be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 4, DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local plan - Part Two (2020) and Paragraph 202 of the NPPF (2021).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan - The Spatial Development Strategy for London consolidated with alterations since 2011 (2016) and national guidance.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning",
    "Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available",
    "detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2,",
    "Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as",
    "offering a full pre-application advice service. We have however been unable to seek solutions to",
    "problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory",
    "policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
