    "Due to the excessive width, scale and bulk and proposed design and architectural form of the proposed extensions, including the flat roof form of the two storey extension, the development would form an oversized addition to the original property which would harm its architectural composition and appearance and reduce the building separation. The proposed development is therefore considered to be harmful to both the character and appearance of host dwelling and the streetscene within a prominent corner location, contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service. We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
