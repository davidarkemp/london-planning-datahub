  "description": "Conversion of roofspace to habitable use to include 3 x side dormers.",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed development, by reason of the siting, size, bulk, height and design of the proposed side dormers, would appear as an incongruous and unsympathetic addition that would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original building, would be detrimental to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the street scene and would fail to either preserve or enhance the character or appearance of the surrounding Harmondsworth Village Conservation Area. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies BE1 and HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 1, DMHB 4, DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), Policy 7.8 of the London Plan (2016) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2019).",
    "The proposed development  would not provide the occupiers of the bedrooms contained with the rear dormer extension with any outlook. The proposal would therefore give rise to a substandard form of living accommodation to the detriment of the amenity of occupiers. This would be contrary to paragraph 127 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), Policy 3.5 and Table 3.3 of the London Plan (2016) and Policy DMHB 16 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2016). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020."
