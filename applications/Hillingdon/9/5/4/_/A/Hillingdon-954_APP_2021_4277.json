    "The proposed two storey side/rear extension by reason of its size, scale, bulk, height, depth, width and proximity to the side boundary, in this open prominent position, would result in the closing of an important gap characteristic to the area, resulting in a cramped appearance. The proposal would therefore represent an overdevelopment of the site to the detriment of the visual amenities of the street scene and the character and appearance of the surrounding area. The proposed development is therefore contrary to  Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the  Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "The proposed two storey side/rear extension, by reason of its size, scale, bulk, width and design would result in an incongruous addition which would would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original dwelling, would be detrimental to the character, appearance and symmetry of the small terrace of houses of which it forms a part and to the visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the  Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way.
