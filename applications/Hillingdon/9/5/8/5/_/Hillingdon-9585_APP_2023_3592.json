    "The development constitutes inappropriate development which is, by definition, harmful to the Green Belt and would have an adverse impact on the openness of the Green Belt. No very special circumstances have been demonstrated that would clearly outweigh the harm caused to the Green Belt. The proposed development is therefore contrary to Policy EM2 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One- Strategic, Paragraphs 154, 155 and 153 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023), Policy  DMEI 4 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020) and Policy G2 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "The development serves a use stated in the application form as car sales and repair which does not benefit from planning permission or a certificate of lawful development being granted to establish its lawful use. Furthermore the site has been subject to an enforcement notice to remove these uses from the site due to the impact derived from these uses to the Green Belt and no evidence has been submitted to demonstrate that the notice was complied with. As such the development does not benefit from immunity from enforcement action and would therefore conflict with the requirements of Paragraphs 59, 154, 155 and 153 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023),  Policy EM2 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One- Strategic,  Policy  DMEI 4 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020) and Policy G2 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "The development, by virtue of its siting, scale, width, mass, height, design, material pallet and associated paraphernalia, would appear as an incongruous and highly conspicuous form of development that would be at odds with the immediate context and the wider rural setting of the site. The pre-existing character of the site has been significantly changed by the development resulting in an industrial appearance unsuitable for its Green Belt designation. The proposal would therefore cause unacceptable harm to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the area, contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One Strategic Policies (2012), Policies DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policies D1, D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2023).",
    "In the absence of a robust Noise and Odour Report and proposed mitigation measures regarding noise from the plant, machinery and use in relation to the nearby residential properties, the application has failed to demonstrate that the development will safeguard the amenities of occupants of nearby residential properties in conflict with Policy EM8 of Hillingdon Local Plan Part One (2012); Policy DMHB11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan (Part Two 2020)  and Policy D14 of the London plan (2021).",
    "In the absence of a Transport Statement the applicant has failed to demonstrate that sufficient parking for vehicles associated with the use would be provided or sufficient manoeuvring and access arrangements for all vehicles including service delivery vehicles. In addition the application fails to demonstrate that the proposal would not result in an unacceptable rise in traffic in and around the application site and by virtue of its location and its remoteness from existing services and facilities and, in particular, from existing infrastructure in the area, the proposal represents an environmentally unsustainable form of development and fails to promote opportunities to travel by non-car based modes of travel and it fails to provide safe, and suitable access for all users. It is considered that the proposal would be detrimental to highway and pedestrian safety contrary to Policies T1, T2, T5, T6 and GG2 of the London Plan and Policies DMT 1 DMT 2 and DMT 6 of the Local Plan Part Two",
    "In the absence of a robust Flood Risk Assessment, the applicant failed to demonstrate that the site is safe and flood risk is suitably mitigated through the provision of an appropriate Flood Risk Assessment. In addition, in the absence of a sequential test, the applicant has failed to provide sufficient justification as to why a replacement building to be used for commercial use as a car repair and car sales should be sited in an area within the floodplain, and does not pass the sequential test. As such the proposal is considered to constitute inappropriate development in conflict with the requirements of Policy EM6 (Flood Risk Management) of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1- Strategic Policies (Nov 2012), Policy DMEI 9 (Management of Flood Risk) of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy SI12 of the London Plan (2021) and Paragraphs 165, 169, 170 and 173 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023)",
    "In the absence of a robust Air Quality Assessment the development would likely contribute to the production of unacceptable pollutant emissions in a designated Air Quality Management Area. The development would not be air quality neutral or air quality positive and the measures proposed are not sufficient to mitigate the total emissions. As such, the development is contrary to Policy EM8 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 (2012), Policy DMEI 14 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 (2020), Policy SI 1 of the London Plan (2021) and paragraphs 180(e) and 192 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023)."
