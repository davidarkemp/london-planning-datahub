    "Due to their height, corner plot location and incorporation of uncharaertistic features (metal railings and electric gates), the proposed boundary treatments would form an unduly prominent and unsympathetic addition to the street scene, which would harm its appearance and create a site frontage which is visually at odds with others in the area. Due to their extensive coverage of the properties frontage, the proposed railings would create a site which is visually incongruous to others in the ASLC which have minimal or no railings. The proposal is therefore considered to be harmful to the visual amenities of the streetscene, surrounding area and ASLC to the detriment of their character and appearance. As such the proposal is contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 5, DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), as well as policies D3 and D6 of the Lond",
    "Due to their close proximity to the highway and design, the proposed electronic entrance gates would result in traffic build up and congestion on the highway as car users at the site would have to wait for the gate to open before entering the site. Additionally it has not been demonstrated that the required pedestrian visibility splays would or could be provided. The absence of the required visibility splays would reduce the likelihood of the sites vehicle users seeing pedestrians crossing the site and would therefore endanger pedestrians, whilst also creating a more hazardous environment for the sites car users. The proposed development is therefore considered to be detrimental to pedestrian and highway safety, as well as the free movement of vehicles on the local highways network. The proposed development is therefore considered to be contrary to Policies DMT 2 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), as well as policy T4 of the London",
