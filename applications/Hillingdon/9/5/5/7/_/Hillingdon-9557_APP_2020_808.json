  "description": "Part two storey, part single storey side/rear extension and conversion of roof space to habitable use to include a rear dormer and 2 front roof lights",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed two storey side/rear extension, by virtue of its siting, size, scale, ridge height and design, in particular the roof profile(s), would fail to appear as a subordinate addition and would thus be detrimental to the character and appearance of the original house, the visual amenities of the street scene and the character and appearance of the wider area. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHD 1 , DMHB 11 and 12 of the Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020)",
    "The roof alteration/extensions, by reason of the size, scale, bulk and design of the rear dormer window would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original semi-detached dwelling, would be detrimental to the character, appearance and symmetry of the pair of semi-detached houses of which it forms a part and to the visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policy DMHD 1 and DMHB 11 and 12 of the Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020)",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the 'Saved' LPP2 2020, Local Plan Part 1, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service."
