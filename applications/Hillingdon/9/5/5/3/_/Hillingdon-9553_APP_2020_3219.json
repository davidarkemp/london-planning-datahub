  "description": "Single storey side extension, first floor side/rear extension and conversion of roofspace to habitable use to include 1 x rear dormer, 2 x front rooflights, 2 x rear rooflights, 4 x side rooflights and conversion of roof from hip to gable end with gable end window.",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed two storey side extension, by reason of its size, scale, bulk, depth, proximity to the boundary and projection forward of the return building line along Mossendew Close, in this open prominent position, would result in the closing of an important gap characteristic to the area, resulting in a cramped appearance. The proposal would therefore represent an over development of the site to the detriment of the visual amenities of the street scene and the character and appearance of the surrounding area. The proposed development is therefore contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the HIllingdon Local Plan Part 2: Development Management Policies (January 2020)",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2016). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service."
