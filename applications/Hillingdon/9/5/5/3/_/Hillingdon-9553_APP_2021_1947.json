    "The proposed two storey side extension, by reason of its scale, bulk, depth, proximity to the highway boundary and projection beyond the return building line along Mossendew Close, and the enclosure of the existing verge within residential curtilage, would form an obtrusive feature in the street scene and would result in the closing of an important gap characteristic to the area, resulting in a cramped appearance. The proposal would therefore represent an over development of the site to the detriment of the visual amenities of the street scene and the character and appearance of the surrounding area. The proposed development is therefore contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the HIllingdon Local Plan Part 2: Development Management Policies (January 2020)",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service."
