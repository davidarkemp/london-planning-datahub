  "description": "Replacement of 6 no. antennas on 3 no. new support poles attached to new steel grillages, to include the installation of 24 no. Remote Radio Units (RRU's) next to the new antennas, replacement of 3 no. equipment cabinets and ancillary development thereto (Application under Class A, Part 16 of Schedule 2 to the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended) for determination as to whether prior approval is required for siting and appearance).",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed telecommunications equipment (including the associated ancillary equipment) would, by virtue of their siting, size, scale, bulk and elevated height, together with the number of equipment being proposed, represent prominent and incongruous features in the street scene that would cause significant harm to the character and appearance of Haydon School, the surrounding street scene and the wider area.  Furthermore, the proposed telecommunications equipment (including the associated ancillary equipment) would have a detrimental impact on the visual amenities of the area, which includes views from neighbouring residential properties. The development would therefore be contrary to paragraphs 115 and 130 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies D1, D4, D8 and SI6 of the London Plan (2021), Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One- Strategic Policies (2012) and Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHB 21 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Manage",
    "The Local Planning Authority considers that the applicants have failed to provide robust evidence to demonstrate that other more suitable and less harmful sites do not exist. Notwithstanding the existing telecommunication equipment on Haydon School, the application site is not considered to be the only solution available that can achieve the desired technical requirements. The development would therefore be contrary to paragraphs 115 and 117 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), and Policy DMHB 21 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020)."
