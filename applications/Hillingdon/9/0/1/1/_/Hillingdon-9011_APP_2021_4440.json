    "In the absence of any robust justification and any planning permission for the re-development of this part of the Hospital Grounds which could be designed to avoid the need for the walkway's complete loss and potentially provide public benefits to mitigate the harm, the loss of the covered walkway would result in significant harm to the locally listed Children's Wing of the Harefield Hospital and the character and appearance of the Harefield Village Conservation Area, contrary to paragraphs 203 and 204 of the NPPF (2021), Policy HC1 of the London Plan (2021), Policy HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies (2012) and Policies DMHB 1, DMHB 3 and DMHB 4 of the Hillingdon Local Plan, Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan - The Spatial Development Strategy for London consolidated with alterations since 2011 (2016) and national guidance.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
