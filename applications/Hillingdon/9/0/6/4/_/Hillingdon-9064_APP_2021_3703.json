    "The proposed development would involve external changes to the property, including the insertion of new windows, alterations to the existing windows and the removal of an external flue.

    "The proposed development would involve the insertion of new windows that would serve the bedrooms of the proposed flat. Given that external changes do not fall within the remit of Class MA, the proposed new windows cannot be considered as part of this prior application. The proposal would therefore not provide an adequate provision of natural light in all the habitable rooms of the proposed flat, contrary to the requirement of provision MA.2.-(2)(f) of Class MA, Part 3, Schedule 2 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "The application fails to demonstrate that future occupants would be safe over the lifetime of the proposed development and that flood risk would be suitably mitigated through the provision of an appropriate flood risk assessment. The proposal would therefore fails to satisfy the requirements of provision MA.2.-(2)(c) of Class MA, Part 3, Schedule 2 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended)."
