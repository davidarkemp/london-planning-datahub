    "The principle of intensifying the residential use involving the loss of existing private garden areas to accommodate an additional dwelling is considered to be unacceptable in principle. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012), Policies DMH 6, DMHB 11 and DMHB 14 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021) and Paragraphs 123 and 128d) of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023).",
    "The development, by reason of its siting, size, scale, bulk, design, layout, site coverage would result in a cramped and visually incongruous form of development that would fail to harmonise with the existing context of the surrounding area. The development as proposed would be detrimental to the character, appearance and visual amenity of the site and surrounding area. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012), Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHB 14 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021) and Paragraphs 128d), 135b) and c) of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023).",
    "The development, by reason of its siting, scale, bulk, design, layout and proximity, would be detrimental to the amenities of the occupiers of the replacement dwelling at Field View and the proposed new dwelling and those at No. 40 South Park Way and Bourne Primary school by way of overdominance, overshadowing, loss of privacy, overlooking, visual intrusion, loss of light and loss of outlook. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policies D3 and D6 of the London Plan (2021) and Paragraph 135f) of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2021). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal.",
    "This is a reminder that Under the terms of the Planning Act 2008 (as amended) and Community Infrastructure Levy Regulations 2010 (as amended), should an application for appeal be allowed, the proposed development would be deemed as 'chargeable development' and therefore liable to pay the London Borough of Hillingdon Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and the Mayor of London's Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This would be calculated in accordance with the London Borough of Hillingdon CIL Charging Schedule 2014 and the Mayor of London's CIL Charging Schedule 2012.",
