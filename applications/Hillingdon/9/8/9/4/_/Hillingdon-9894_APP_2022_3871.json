    "The proposal will result in more than 10% of properties on Kingsend consisting of flatted developments with adverse implications for the character of the streetscene and neighbour impacts, contrary to Policy DMH 4 of the Hillingdon Local Plan (Part 2) 2020.",
    "In the absence of a robust, thorough and well supported Heritage Assessment advocating for the demolition of the existing dwelling, it has not been adequately demonstrated that the demolition of the existing dwelling would not result in harm to the Ruislip Village Conservation Area; the streetscene; and historic character of Kingsend. The proposal is therefore contrary to Section 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990, Section 16 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021, Policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021, Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan (Part 1) 2012 and Policy DMHB 4 of the Hillingdon Local Plan (Part 2) 2020.",
    "By virtue of its excessive scale, form, footprint, building width (including roof ridge) and crown roof, incompatible design, net loss of mature trees and landscaping, and alteration to the natural landform at the rear of the proposed building, the proposed dwelling would result in a development that does not harmonise with the built form and significantly detracts from the character of the area, failing to preserve or enhance the character and appearance of the Ruislip Village Conservation Area, contrary to Sections 12 and 16 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021, Policies BE1, DMH 6, DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan 2020, and Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "By virtue of the number, location and siting of side facing windows and rear facing balconies and because of the subterranean nature of the patio areas of the basement, the development will pose unacceptable privacy implications for residents at neighbouring properties to the east and west and within the development. The extension of the building well beyond the rear building line of 34A Kingsend to the west also poses an unacceptable level of dominance to its neighbour. Therefore, the proposal is contrary to Policies BE1 and EM8 of the Hillingdon Local Plan (Part 1) 2012 and Policies DMH 4, DMHB 1 and DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan (Part 2) 2020.",
    "By virtue of their subterranean location with little to no outlook, access to sunlight or natural ventilation, large number of windowless rooms, no connectivity to the rear garden and significant internal room and unit depth, the level of amenity afforded to the future occupants of the two basement units is very poor and is contrary to Section 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021, Policies D6 and D10 of the London Plan 2021, Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan (Part 1) 2012 and Policy DMH 2 of the Hillingdon Local Plan (Part 2) 2012.",
    "The siting of the cycle storage shed is ill-considered on account of the significant distances required for residents to move between the shed and the front entrance of the building, the lack of natural surveillance, and the unnecessary removal of Tree 9. This is likely to make cycle usage by residents inconvenient, thus deterring use of cycles and resulting in a less sustainable development, increased potential of theft of bicycles and avoidable and unacceptable landscape and ecological impacts for the site. This is contrary to Sections 9, 12 and 15 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021, Policies D11, G6, G7 and T5 of the London Plan 2021, Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan (Part 1) 2012 and Policies DMH 4, DMHB 14, DMHB 15, DMT 5 and DMEI 7 of the Hillingdon Local Plan (Part 2) 2020.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service. We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
