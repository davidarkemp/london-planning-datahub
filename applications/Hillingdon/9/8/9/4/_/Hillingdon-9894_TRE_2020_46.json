The Horse Chestnut is situated within the rear garden of 32 and can be seen from the public right of way to the side of the property. As a result it has a moderate to high amenity value. Both trees significantly contribute to the arboricultural character of Ruislip Conservation area.",
    "Both trees have been subject to past management however no reasons have been provided for the work to the Horse Chestnut and as a result there is no justification as to why 3m more than previously needs to be removed. The Oak tree does have a slightly lopsided crown (when viewed looking straight at the properties) but there is no justification as to why this has now become something to rectify.",
