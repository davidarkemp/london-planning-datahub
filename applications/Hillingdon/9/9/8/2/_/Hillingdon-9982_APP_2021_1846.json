    "The proposed two storey side extension, by reason of its siting, size, scale, bulk, and proximity to the side boundary, would result in a closing of the visually open gap between it and the mutual boundary shared with number 28 Hartland Drive, giving rise to a cramped form of development and possible terracing effect, which would be detrimental to the visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area. The proposal is therefore contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The proposed two storey side extension, by virtue of its siting, size, scale, bulk, massing and design, would fail to appear as a subordinate addition. The proposal would therefore be detrimental to the appearance of the original host dwelling, to the character, appearance and symmetry of the row of terrace houses of which it forms a part and to the visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area. The proposal would therefore be contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "The proposed rear dormer extension, by virtue of excessive size, scale, bulk and design, would represent an overly-dominant and disproportionate addition to the roof of the original host dwelling. As a result, the proposed rear dormer would detract from the character and appearance of the host dwelling, the row of terrace houses of which it forms a part and to the visual amenities of the surrounding area. The proposal would therefore be contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "Insufficient evidence has been submitted to demonstrate that the proposed development would maintain an adequate provision of private amenity space in accordance with the minimum standards set out in Table 5.3 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020). The proposal would therefore have a harmful effect on the living conditions of the occupants of the host property at number 30 Hartland Drive, in terms of the undermining the external amenity space provision at the site. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policies DMHB 18 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2016). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020."
