    "In the absence of a robust, thorough and well supported Heritage Assessment, it has not been adequately demonstrated that the demolition of the existing dwelling would result in less than substantial harm to the Ickenham Village Conservation Area of the streetscene and historic character of The Avenue. The proposal is therefore contrary to Section 66 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990, Section 16 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021, Policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies BE1 and DMHB 4 of the Hillingdon Local Plan 2020.",
    "By virtue of its excessive scale, form, height and crown roof, inconsistent building line and inadequate side setbacks, the proposed dwelling would result in a development that does not harmonise with the built form and significantly detracts from the character of the area, contrary to Paragraph 130 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021 and Policies BE1, DMH 6 and DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan 2020, and Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "Due to its scale, siting and height, the proposed dwelling will have a material impact upon the existing solar panels on the roof of the existing dwelling at 27 The Avenue. In the absence of satisfactory information to the contrary, the Council cannot satisfactorily conclude that the proposal would not result in an unreasonable reduction in energy generation from the solar panels, thereby posing adverse climate change and energy efficiency impacts, contrary to the underlying intent of Section 14 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021 and Polices BE1, DMHB 11, EM1 and DMEI 2 of the Hillingdon Local Plan 2020 and Policy G6 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "In the absence of a preliminary ecology assessment, it has not been demonstrated that the proposal, including demolition of the existing dwelling, would not have an adverse impact upon protected species and nature conservation or that there would be protection and enhancement of biodiversity. This is contrary to Section 15 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021, Policies BE1, DMH 6, DMHB 14 and DMEI 7 of the Hillingdon Local Plan 2020 and Policy G6 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "The Flood Risk Assessment submitted with the application lacks detail with respect to flood levels, finished floor levels, climate change allowance and access routes such that there is insufficient information to conclude that the proposal would not result in adverse flood risk to future occupiers, contrary to Section 15 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021, Policies EM6 and DMEI 9 of the Hillingdon Local Plan 2020 and Policy SI12 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan - The Spatial Development Strategy for London consolidated with alterations since 2011 (2016) and national guidance.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service. We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
