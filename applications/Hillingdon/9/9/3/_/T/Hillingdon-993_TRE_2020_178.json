    "The Oak tree is situated close to the front boundary of 137 Swakeleys Road. Swakeleys Road is a main road through the borough and as a result the tree is seen by a very wide variety of people. The tree has a Very High amenity value. The Oak is one of a number of mature trees within front gardens along Swakeleys Road and it significantly contributes to the Arboricultural character and amenity of the area. The benefit in amenity and biodiversity afforded by this tree is both present and future because it has the potential for a long life expectancy.",
    "The Oak has never been pruned before and as a result has a natural crown typical of its species and it appears to be in good health. Pruning this Oak would unnecessarily introduce multiple wounds into it's crown, which would likely cause stress and lead to infection, affecting its long-term health; this would affect the safe useful life expectancy of the tree. Pruning would also result in weakly attached re-growth forming that would be prone",
    "The removal of deadwood, dangerous / hanging branches and ivy:  This does not require the formal consent of the Council.",
    "Statutory crown lifting of trees: This does not require formal consent of the Council if the clearance only involves the removal of branches to give a separation between the footway and the tips of the lowest branches by up to 2.3m or the carriageway by up to 5.2m."
