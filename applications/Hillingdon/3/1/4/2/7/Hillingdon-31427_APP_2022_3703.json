    "The proposed development by reason of its size, scale, bulk, and massing, in particular the cumulative impact of lack of set back along the eastern elevation and the overall width, would result in an incongruous and visually intrusive form of development that could not constitute subordinate additions to the existing dwellinghouse. The proposed the works would fail to respect the architectural composition of the existing dwellinghouse and fail to harmonise with the established built environment on Old Hatch Manor resulting in a detrimental impact on the character and appearance of the surrounding area. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012), Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two- Development Management Policies (2020) and Chapter 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "By reason of its proximity, depth, scale, bulk, and height, the proposed cumulative effect of the proposed development is that it would have a harmful impact on the living conditions of the occupiers of Nos. 8, and 12 Old Hatch Manor and their associated private amenity space, in terms of loss of outlook, overdominance, loss of light, sense of enclosure and overbearing impact. The proposal would therefore be contrary to to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11, and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The proposed development involves extensive and wholesale wall removal rendering the application a replacement dwelling and the proposed development cannot be considered as extensions to an existing dwelling house. It cannot therefore be considered via the householder application route.",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan - The Spatial Development Strategy for London consolidated with alterations since 2011 (2016) and national guidance.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service. We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
