  "decision_conditions": [
    "The part two storey, part first floor rear extension by reason of its size, scale, bulk, and design represents an incongruous form of development which fails to be subordinate to the host dwelling and would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original dwelling and would be detrimental to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies",
    "The front porch and first floor extension above it by reason of their size, scale, and design represent an incongruous form of development which fails to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original dwelling and would be detrimental to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies",
    "The proposed pitched and hipped roof over the first floor rear/side/front extension by reason of its size, scale, bulk, and design represents an incongruous form of development which fails to be subordinate to the host dwelling and would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original dwelling and would be detrimental to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies",
    "The proposed first floor rear extension, by reason of its size, scale, bulk and proximity, would be detrimental to the amenities of the adjoining occupier at 30 Park Way by reason of over dominance, overshadowing, visual intrusion, loss of light and loss of outlook. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2: Development Management Policies (January 2020)",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the Local Plan Part 1 Strategic policies (November 2012); Local Plan Part 2 Development Management Polices (January 2020); Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service. We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
