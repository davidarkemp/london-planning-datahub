    "These three mature English Oak trees (T24, T25, and T26) are situated in the rear garden of the property, next to the north west boundary. These trees are prominent in the local landscape and have a moderate amenity value. All of these trees have a good natural appearance and are also important for their cohesion as a group - which collectively has a moderate amenity value.",
    "The reasons given are not viewed as justified reasons for carrying out this level of pruning. It would unnecessarily introduce multiple pruning wounds to these trees which would likely lead to infection and would also have a negative impact on the natural appearance of the crown. Therefore, the proposed work would reduce the size and amenity value of these three trees, and would also be detrimental to their overall natural appearance.",
    "These trees are not currently considered to require this level of pruning and therefore the proposed work is viewed as unnecessary and unjustified.",
