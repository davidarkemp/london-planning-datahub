    "These three mature English Oak trees (T24, T25, and T26) are situated in the rear garden of the property, next to the north west boundary. These trees are prominent in the local landscape and have a moderate amenity value. All these trees have a good natural appearance and are also important for their cohesion as a group.",
    "No reasons as to why height reductions are necessary and there is no information in relation to the level of reduction the applicant wishes to carry out.",
    "The proposed work is unnecessary, unjustified and will have a detrimental impact on the health and natural appearance of these trees by unnecessarily introducing large pruning wounds. This will result in a detrimental impact on the visual amenity and arboreal character of the local area.",
    "The removal of deadwood, dangerous / hanging branches and ivy:  This does not require the formal consent of the Council."
