    "The proposed part two storey, part single storey rear extension, by virtue of its siting in relation to the adjoining property, size, scale, bulk and proximity, would be detrimental to the amenities of the adjoining occupier at 26 Finians Close by reason of overdominance, overshadowing, visual intrusion and loss of outlook. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to policies BE19, BE20 and BE21 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Saved UDP Policies (November 2012) and the Council's adopted Supplementary Planning Document HDAS: Residential Extensions.",
    "The proposed part two storey, part single storey rear extension, by reason of its siting, size, scale, bulk, width and design, would fail to appear as a subordinate addition, detrimental to the appearance of the original and adjoining properties. The proposal would therefore be detrimental to the character and appearance of the existing and adjoining properties and the visual amenities of the wider area. The proposal is therefore contrary to policies BE13, BE15, and BE19 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Saved UDP Policies (November 2012) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document HDAS: Residential Extensions.",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant saved policies (referred to as policies from the Hillingdon Unitary Development Plan - Saved Policies September 2007), then London Plan Policies (2016).  On the 8th November 2012 Hillingdon's Full Council agreed the adoption of the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies. Appendix 5 of this explains which saved policies from the old Unitary Development (which was subject to a direction from Secretary of State in September 2007 agreeing that the policies were 'saved') still apply for development control decisions.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. The Council's supports pre-application discussions.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
