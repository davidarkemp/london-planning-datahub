Another reason provided by the applicant is to reduce encroachment but as the tree is at the rear of the garden it is considered that the tree is situated in an appropriate location and it is unclear as to what the tree is encroaching into. At approximately 18m tall the tree is not considered to be overly large and a reduction by as much as 6m is considered excessive and would adversely affect the visual amenity of the tree.",
