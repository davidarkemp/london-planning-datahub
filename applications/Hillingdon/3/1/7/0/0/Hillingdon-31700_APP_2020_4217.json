  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposal, by reason of its size, scale, layout and independent access, is considered capable of independent occupation and is thus tantamount to the creation of a self-contained separate dwelling, where such a dwelling would not be acceptable due to its impact on the character and appearance of the host dwelling and the wider locality, the need for additional parking and amenity space and issues relating to impact on the existing and adjoining dwellings. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policies DMHD 2, DMHB 11, DMHB 12, DMHB 16, DMHB 18, DMT 2 and DMT 6 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), Policies Policy 3.5 and 7.4 of the London Plan (2016), the Housing Standards Minor Alterations to The London Plan (March 2016), the Mayor of London's adopted Supplementary Planning Guidance - Housing (March 2016) and the Technical Housing Standards - Nationally Described Space Standard (March 2015). and 7.4 of the London Plan (2016).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2016). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020."
