    "The proposal by reason of its siting in this prominent corner position, size, scale, bulk, width, height and design would result in the loss of an important gap characteristic to the area, resulting in a cramped appearance. The proposal would therefore represent an overdevelopment of the site to the detriment of the character, appearance and visual amenities of the area and to this existing open area of the street scene. Therefore the proposal is contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMH6, DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), Policies D3, D4, D6 and D8 of the London Plan (2021) and paragraph 135 of the NPPF (2023).",
    "By reason of the lack of a double occupancy bedroom within the dwelling, the proposal would fail to provide satisfactory internal amenity space for future occupiers. It would therefore subject future occupiers to cramped internal living accommodation to the detriment of their amenities, contrary to Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021) and Policy DMHB 16 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2- Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The new dwelling would fail to meet the requirements for a M4(2) accessible and adaptable dwelling as set out in Approved Document M to the Building Regulations (2015 edition), contrary to Policy D7 of the London Plan (2023).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan (2021)  and national guidance.",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2021). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
