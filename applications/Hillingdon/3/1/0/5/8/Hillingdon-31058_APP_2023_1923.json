    "The proposed outbuilding, by reason of its size, height, scale and bulk, would result in overly dominant and incongruous feature in relation to the site and the wider locality, and as such the development would be detrimental to the visual amenity of the original property and surrounding area.  Therefore the development conflicts with Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), and Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 2 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (January 2020)",
    "The proposed development, by reason of the reduced rear garden size, would be detrimental to the amenity of the current and any future occupiers of 16 Coronation Road, and would give rise to a substandard form of accommodation, by reason of loss of private amenity space As such, the proposal would be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One Strategic Policies (2012) and Policies DMHD 1, DMHB 11 and DMHB 18 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020)."
