    "The proposed two storey side and rear extensions, by reason of design, scale, bulk and massing, would fail to respect the architectural integrity of the host building, including its adjoining semi, appearing overbearing and dominant to the host building and out of keeping with the wider character and appearance of the area, contrary to Policies DMHD1, DMHB11 and DMHB12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two (2020).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service. We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
