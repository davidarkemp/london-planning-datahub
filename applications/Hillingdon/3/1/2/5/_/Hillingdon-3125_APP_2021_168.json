  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed development has failed to demonstrate that unacceptable levels of noise and disturbance to surrounding residential occupiers would not occur. In the absence of any noise surveys or noise mitigation measures, the proposed development is considered to result in noise and disturbance to the detriment of the amenity of adjoining occupiers, contrary to Policies DMHB 11 and DMTC 4 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and Policy D14 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "In the absence of a Transport Statement the application has not demonstrated that sufficient parking for vehicles associated with the use would be provided. In addition the application fails to demonstrate that the proposal would not result in an unacceptable rise in traffic in and around the application site. It is considered that the proposal would be detrimental to highway and pedestrian safety contrary to policies DMT 2 and DMT 6 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and to Hillingdon's Adopted Parking Standards as set out in Appendix C of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "The proposal has failed to demonstrate a step free access and thus fails to meet the requirements of people with disabilities to the detriment of the amenity of future users contrary to Policy D5 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan (2021)",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the 'Saved' UDP 2007, Local Plan Part 1, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service. This is a resubmission of a previously refused scheme, where the Inspectors Report identified issues to be addressed, which were reflected in the reasons for refusal, allowing the opportunity to address those issues within this submission."
