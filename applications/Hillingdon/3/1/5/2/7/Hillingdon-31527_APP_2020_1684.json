  "description": "Single storey front and side extension and conversion of roof space to habitable use to include raising of ridge height, 3 rear and 1 front dormers, 1 front roof light and and conversion of both sides of roof from hip to gable end",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed side/rear/front extension, together with the hip-to-gable conversion and the raising of the height of the ridge, by reason of their siting in a visually prominent position, size, scale, bulk and design would represent an overbearing and incongruous form of development that would fail to appear as subordinate additions or harmonise with the architectural composition of the original dwelling and would be detrimental to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020)",
    "The single storey front extension by virtue of its size, scale, bulk and depth would be detrimental to the amenities of the adjoining occupiers at 9 Windrush Close by reason of visual intrusion and loss of outlook. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2016). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service. We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal.",
