Use of the outbuilding for purposes such as a living room, bedroom, kitchen, bathroom, study, as a separate unit of accommodation or for business purposes constitutes a primary use that is not incidental and likely to invalidate this certificate. Furthermore, the Local Planning Authority may pursue enforcement against breaches of planning control, which may involve legal action through the Courts."
