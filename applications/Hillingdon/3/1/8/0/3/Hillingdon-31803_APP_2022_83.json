  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed development would provide substandard living conditions for future occupiers, in terms of the provision of internal floorspace, proposed design and layout.  The proposal would therefore conflict with Policy DMH5, DMHB 16 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy D6 and Table 3.1 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "In the absence of a robust assessment and detailed information relating to the storage of refuse, parking and further noise being created, including mitigation and organisational strategies, it is considered that the amenity of both existing and future occuipers could be adversely impacted through the intensification of the use, alongside the living conditions of near neighbours, failing to comply with Policies DMHB 11 and DMH 5 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The proposal, by virtue of it's failure to provide an adequate amount of private usable external amenity space for the occupiers of both the existing and proposed development, would result in an over-development of the site to the detriment of the residential amenity of existing and future occupiers. The proposal is therefore contrary to the requirements of Policies DMH5,  DMHB 11 and DMHB 18 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "In the absence of a legal agreement to secure the new development as parking permit free, the development would add further parking stress to an area which is already heavily congested, having a direct and harmful impact on to the amenities of other residents using the controlled parking zone and resulting in undue trips to locate parking spaces and a notable impact on highway and pedestrian safety, all contrary to Policy DMT6  of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020) and Policy T6 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
