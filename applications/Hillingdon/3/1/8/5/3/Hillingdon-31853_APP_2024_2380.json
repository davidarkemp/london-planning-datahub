    "In the absence of scaled swept path analysis, the Applicant has failed to demonstrate that the site would have sufficient dimensions to provide acceptable manoeuvring space to ensure that vehicles would not reverse onto North Hyde Road. This would result in a risk of harm to highway safety for all users (pedestrians, cyclists, and drivers), contrary to Chapter 9 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023), Policy T4 of the London Plan (2021), Policies DMT 1 and DMT 2 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), and the Council's 'Domestic Vehicle Footway Crossover' Policy (2022).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "In order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably. In addition further guidance was offered to the applicant by the case officer during the processing of the application to identify the amendments to address those elements of the scheme considered unacceptable which the applicant chose not to implement."
