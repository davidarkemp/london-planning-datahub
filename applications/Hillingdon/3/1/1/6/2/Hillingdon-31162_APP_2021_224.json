  "description": "Part two storey, part single storey front/side extension, conversion for roofspace to habitable use to include raising ridge height, 2 rear dormers, 3 front rooflights and 3 side rooflights and widening of vehicular crossover to front",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed part two storey, part single storey side extension, by reason of its siting in this open prominent position, its size, scale, proximity to the side boundary and projection forward of the return building line along Court Drive, would result in the virtual loss of an important gap characteristic to the area, resulting in a cramped appearance. The proposal would therefore represent an overdevelopment of the site to the detriment of the visual amenities of the street scene and the character and appearance of the surrounding area.The proposed development would conflict with the requirements of Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), and policies DMHB11; DMHB12 and DMHD1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The proposed crossover, by reason of its position at a junction and its excessive width would result in the disruption of the free flow of traffic and would be detrimental to highway and pedestrian safety contrary to Policy DMT2 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the 'Saved' UDP 2007, Local Plan Part 1, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service. This is a resubmission of a previously refused scheme, where the Inspectors Report identified issues to be addressed, which were reflected in the reasons for refusal, allowing the opportunity to address those issues within this submission."
