  "description": "Single storey rear extension and conversion of roofspace to habitable use to include a rear dormer",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed development by reason of the size, scale, bulk and design of the conversion of the side hip to gable and the rear dormer window would represent a visually unsympathetic form of development that would fail to respect the character and appearance of the original dwelling, or the pair of which it forms a part, and would be detrimental to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the street scene and the wider area. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies  DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service."
