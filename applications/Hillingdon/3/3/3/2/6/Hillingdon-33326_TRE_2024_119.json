    "The oak is located in the front garden of 167 Park Avenue, and is on the boundary to 165 Park Avenue. The tree has an attractive crown and is overlooked by properties on Park Avenue and Dormywood, and can be viewed by passing vehicles and pedestrians from the main road. The tree is situated close to the southern boundary of Park Wood SSSI.",
