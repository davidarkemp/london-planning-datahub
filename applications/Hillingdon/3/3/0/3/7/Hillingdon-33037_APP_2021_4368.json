    "The proposed development, on account of it consisting entirely of one bedroom units, would fail to address identified local housing need or provide an appropriate mix of units of different sizes, contrary to Policies DMH 1 and DMH 2 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy H10 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "No legal agreement is in place to prohibit future residents of the proposed development from applying to join the Council's on street parking management scheme. In the absence of such an agreement the Council's Parking Management Scheme is likely to be overrun, leading to roadside parking, congestion and a reduction in highway safety. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policy DMT 2, DMT 6 of the Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020) and policies T6 and T4 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "The proposed first floor flat, by virtue of its substandard internal floor layout, fails to meet the Nationally Described Space Standards and would result in a substandard form of accommodation to the detriment of the amenity of future occupants. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policy DMHB 16 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021), the Technical Housing Standards - Nationally Described Space Standard (2015) and paragraph 130 (f) of the NPPF (2021).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan (2021).",
    "This is a reminder that Under the terms of the Planning Act 2008 (as amended) and Community Infrastructure Levy Regulations 2010 (as amended), should an application for appeal be allowed, the proposed development would be deemed as 'chargeable development' and therefore liable to pay the London Borough of Hillingdon Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and the Mayor of London's Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This would be calculated in accordance with the London Borough of Hillingdon CIL Charging Schedule 2014 and the Mayor of London's CIL Charging Schedule 2012.",
