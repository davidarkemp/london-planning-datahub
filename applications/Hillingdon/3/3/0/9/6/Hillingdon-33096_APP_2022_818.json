    "The ground floor 2 bedroom, 4 person flat fails to provide 70sqm of internal floor space for its future occupiers. The first floor 2 bedroom, 3 person flat (set over two floors) fails to provide 70sqm of internal floor space for its future occupiers. The proposed flats would therefore be of an unsatisfactory size for their future occupiers, giving rise to a substandard form of living accommodation, harming the amenities of their future occupiers. Accordingly, the new flats are considered to be contrary to the requirements of Policy D6 A of the London Plan (2021), Policy DMHB 16 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and the Technical Housing Standards - Nationally Described Space Standard (2015).",
    "The proposed dormer would be over two thirds of the width of the property's original roof and is therefore not considered to form a subordinate addition to the dwelling. Additionally It would relate poorly to the buildings fenestration, as its window would not align with those below. Furthermore, when viewed alongside the other extensions at the property, the proposal would result in an over development of the dwelling and almost the complete loss of its original character and appearance. The proposal would therefore result in harm to the character and appearance of the area contrary to Policy DMHD 1 and DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",

    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan (2021) and national guidance."
