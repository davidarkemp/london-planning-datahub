    "The proposed extensions, by virtue of failure to maintain an adequate amount of private usable external amenity space for the occupiers of the extended property, would result in an over-development of the site detrimental to the residential amenity of existing and future occupiers. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies DMHD 1, DMHB 11 and DMHB 18 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "The proposal by reason of its excessive bulk, width, size and siting would result in an over development of the site which fails to read as a subordinate addition to the host property, harming the original design and appearance of the host property, detrimental to the character and appearance of the surrounding area and fails to comply with Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHD 1, DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021) and Chapter 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
