  "decision_conditions": [
    "The details received pursuant to condition 3 (Materials) are unacceptable. The proposed materials to be used for the walls and roof would fail to relate the existing pallet of the street scene and would be detrimental to the character and appearance of the proposed development and the visual amenity of the wider Area of Special Local Character. The proposal is thus contrary to Policies DMHB 5, DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 (2020).",
    "The details received pursuant to condition 4 (Method Statement and Tree protection) are considered insufficient. A full Method Statement is required. In the absence of such, the scheme fails to comply with Policy DMHB 14 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "The details received pursuant to condition 5 (Landscaping) are considered insufficient. The proposal fails to ensure the construction of a new driveway would not have a detrimental effect on the protected tree. In its current form, it is not considered that sufficient information has been received to demonstrate that the proposal would not impact on the visual amenities of the locality. As such the scheme fails to comply with Policy DMHB 14 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The details received pursuant to condition 9 (Construction Logistics Plan) are considered insufficient. Although some reference is made to keeping the roadways clear of debris etc, specific reference should also be made to 'wheel washing ' facilities which is absent from the submission. As such the scheme fails to comply with Policies DMT 1 and DMT 2 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service."
