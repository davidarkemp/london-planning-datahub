    "The proposed first floor side extension, by virtue of its size, scale and design including the lack of a set backs from the established front building line and the boundary with No.17 Roker Park Avenue would result in an excessive, visually intrusive, disproportionate, incongruous and overbearing addition that would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original dwelling and the symmetry of existing development along Roker Park Avenue to the detriment of the visual amenities of the street scene and the character and appearance of the surrounding area. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012) and Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The proposed first floor side extension, by reason of its size, scale, bulk, design, proximity to the boundary and having particular regard to the stepped nature of the properties where the application site sits forward of No.17 Roker Park Avenue, would be detrimental to the amenities of the adjacent occupiers at No.17 Roker Park Avenue, by reason of overdominance, loss of outlook, sense of enclosure, visual intrusion, loss of daylight/sunlight and overbearing impact.  As such, the proposal would be contrary to Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2021). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020."
