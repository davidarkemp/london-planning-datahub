  "description": "Single storey front/side/rear extension, conversion of garage to habitable use and conversion of roofspace to habitable use to include a front dormer, 9 x side rooflights and part conversion of roof from hip to gable end.",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed resulting roof form, by reason of its cumulative size, scale, bulk, massing and design, would appear as a disproportionate and incongruous form of development that would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original dwelling, would be detrimental to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the street scene and the wider Hillside, Northwood Hills Area of Special Local Character. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies BE1 and HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 1, DMHB 5, DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy 7.8 of the London Plan (2016) and the NPPF.",
    "The proposed rear hipped to gable end conversion, by reason of its design, scale, size, bulk and massing, would fail would appear as visually unsympathetic form of development that would fail to respect the original roof form and architectural composition of the original dwelling, and would be detrimental to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the wider Hillside, Northwood Hills Area of Special Local Character. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies BE1 and HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 1, DMHB 5, DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy 7.8 of the London Plan (2016) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2019).",
    "The proposed front dormer, by reason of its siting in this visually prominent position, size, scale, bulk, and design, would fail to respect the original roof form and architectural composition of the dwelling, and would be harmful to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the street scene and the wider Hillside, Northwood Hills Area of Special Local Character. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policies BE1 and HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 1, DMHB 5, DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), Policy 7.8 of the London Plan (2016) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2019).",
    "The proposed single storey rear extension including the resulting roof form, by virtue of its scale, bulk, height and proximity, would have a harmful impact on the living conditions and external amenity space of the occupiers at No. 32 Hillside Road, in terms of loss of outlook, over dominance, overbearing impact and sense of enclosure. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policies DMHD 1 and DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020) and the National Planning Policy Framework (February 2019)",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2016). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020."
