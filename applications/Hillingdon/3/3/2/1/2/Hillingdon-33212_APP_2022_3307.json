    "The proposed development, by reason of the erosion of the open character of the site, together with the siting, scale and height of the proposed closed boarded fencing and shed, would result in an incongruous and visually obtrusive form of development which would fail to respect the local area and the surrounding street scape. As such, the proposal would have a detrimental impact on the character, appearance and visual amenities of the existing street scenes and the residential area as a whole. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012), Policies DCMI 3, DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020), Policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The application fails to demonstrate that the open/amenity space to be lost to the development is surplus to requirements. Additionally, the proposed development would remove the value the site has as open land as it would not longer provide a visual break on The Avenue and Chelwood Close and would obscure the views of the protected trees on the site.  The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy DMCI 3 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy G4 of the London Plan (2021) and paragraph 99 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The proposed development, by virtue of the proximity, siting, scale and height of the close boarded fencing, would result in  an undue loss of outlook, visual intrusion, sense of enclosure and overbearing impact for the neighbouring occupiers residing at numbers 2 and 17 Chelwood Close.  The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012), Policy DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020) , Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021) and paragraph 130 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The proposed development, by virtue of the enclosure of the site with close boarded fencing and in the absence of an Arboricultural Report to the British Standard 5837:2021, would cause harm to the trees on and adjacent to the site and result in the loss of the open and verdant character and appearance of the site. The proposal would therefore conflict with Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012), Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHB 14 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2- Development Management Policies (2020), Policies D3, D4 and G7 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021)."
