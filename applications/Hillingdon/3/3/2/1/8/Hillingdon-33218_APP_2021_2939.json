    "The first floor rear extension, by reason of its siting, width and overall design incorporating hipped roof form which would be substantially different from the angle of the traditional hipped roof over the application property, would constitute an unsympathetic and disproportionate addition to the original house that would be detrimental to its character, appearance and architectural composition. Given its location in a very prominent position visually, the extension would detract from the visual amenities of the street scene and surrounding area. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020) and Policy D4 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service."
