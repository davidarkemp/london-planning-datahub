  "description": "Two storey side/rear extension, single storey front extension, conversion of roofspace to habitable use to include a rear dormer and 6 x rooflights including raising of roof and erection of attached garage to front.",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed two storey rear extension coupled with the roof alterations/extensions, by reason of the roof design and the siting, size, scale, bulk, and design of the enlargements would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original and adjoining dwellings and would be detrimental to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the street scene. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHD 1, DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), Policy 7.8 of the London Plan (2016) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2019).",
    "The proposed two storey rear extension, by virtue of its size, scale, bulk, depth and proximity to boundaries would be detrimental to the amenities of the adjoining occupiers at Nos. 46 & 50 Vine Lane, by reason of overdominance, overshadowing, visual intrusion, loss of light and loss of outlook. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the adopted Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The proposed single storey front extension, by reason of its siting, size, scale, bulk and design would result in an incongruous and overly dominant addition which would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original dwelling and would be detrimental to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policies DMHD 1, DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2016). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020."
