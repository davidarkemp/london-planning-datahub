    "The proposed part two storey, part single storey side and rear extensions by virtue of their siting, size, scale, bulk, excessive width and design, fail to read as subordinate additions and fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original terraced dwelling, harmful to character and appearance of the terrace group, street scene and surrounding area. Therefore the proposal is  contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "The proposed part two storey rear extension, by virtue of its width, size, scale, bulk, depth and proximity to the shared boundary would be detrimental to the amenities of the adjoining occupier at 10 Dawlish Drive, by reason of over-dominance, overbearing, overshadowing, visual intrusion, loss of light and loss of outlook. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The raised patio by reason of its height and proximity to the eastern and western site boundaries, would be detrimental to the amenities of the neighbouring properties at 6 and 10 Dawlish Drive, by reason of loss of privacy and overlooking. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
