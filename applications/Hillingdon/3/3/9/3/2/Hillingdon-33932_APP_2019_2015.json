  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed development, by reason of its siting and layout would result in a development of the site, which would fail to harmonise with the existing local and historic context of the surrounding area. The principle of intensifying the residential use of the site to the level proposed, as well as the proposed loss of existing garden area would have a detrimental impact on the character and appearance of the area as a whole. The proposal is therefore detrimental to the visual amenity and character of the surrounding area and contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies BE13 and BE19 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Saved UDP Policies (November 2012), Policies DMH6 and DMHB5 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies with Modifications (March 2019), Policies 3.5, 7.1 and 7.4 of the London Plan (March 2016), the Mayor of London's adopted Supplementary Planning Guidance - Housing (March",
    "The proposed development by reason of its size, design, proximity to the side boundaries and extensive coverage by buildings would result in a cramped and incongruous form of development which would fail to harmonise with the established local context of the surrounding area to the detriment of the visual amenity of the street scene and the character and appearance of the wider Hillingdon Court Park Area of Special Local Character. Therefore the proposal is contrary to Policy BE1 and HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies BE5, BE13 and BE19 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Saved UDP Policies (November 2012), Policy DMHB11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies with Modifications (March 2019), Policies 3.5 and 7.4 of the London Plan (2016) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document HDAS: Residential Layouts.",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant saved policies (referred to as policies from the Hillingdon Unitary Development Plan - Saved Policies September 2007), then London Plan Policies (2016).  On the 8th November 2012 Hillingdon's Full Council agreed the adoption of the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies. Appendix 5 of this explains which saved policies from the old Unitary Development (which was subject to a direction from Secretary of State in September 2007 agreeing that the policies were 'saved') still apply for development control decisions.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the 'Saved' UDP 2007, Local Plan Part 1, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
