    "The proposed part two storey/part single storey rear extension, by reason of its siting, size, scale, bulk, massing and design, when viewed in combination with the existing and proposed side dormers, would unduly dominate the original building to an unacceptable degree. The proposed part two storey/part single storey rear extension would appear as an incongruous and visually intrusive addition that would detract from the modest proportions and form of the host building. The scheme would thereby be detrimental to the character and appearance of the host building and the visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area. The proposal would thus be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHD 1, DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The proposed extensions to the existing side dormers, by reason of their excessive, width, size, scale, bulk, coupled with their siting and design, would appear as an incongruous and visually obtrusive form of development which would significantly detract from the original roof form of the property and cause harm to the character and appearance of the surrounding area. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012), Policies DMHD 1, DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2021). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "a) We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
