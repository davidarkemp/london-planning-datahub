  "description": "Installation of 2 non-illuminated banners and 1 externally illuminated fascia sign",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed signs by virtue of siting above ground floor level, size, design and illumination would be detrimental to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the street scene and would fail to either preserve or enhance the character or appearance of the surrounding Old Uxbridge/Windsor Street Conservation Area. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies BE1 and HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 1, DMHB 4 and DMHB 13A of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), Policy 7.8 of the London Plan (2016) and the NPPF.",
