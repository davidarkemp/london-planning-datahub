A CDA is the catchment area from which surface water drains and contributes to drainage problems.

Therefore the applicant should minimise the water from your site entering the sewers. No drainage to support the extensions should be connected to any existing surface water sewer, other than as an overflow. Water run off from any roof or hard paving associated with the development should be directed to a soakaway, or tank or made permeable. Water butts should be incorporated.",
