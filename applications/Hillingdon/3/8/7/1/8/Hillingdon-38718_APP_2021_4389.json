  "description": "Demolition of an existing single storey dwellinghouse and garage and erection of a two storey detached dwellinghouse with habitable roofspace",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed dwelling, by virtue of its excessive scale, bulk, mass, height and design (including a top heavy uncharacteristic crown roof profile, gable projections and expansive open glazing), would result in an unduly prominent and visually incongruous form of development that would be detrimental to the character, appearance, visual amenities of the existing street scene on Thornhill Road and the surrounding area. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policy BE 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One- Strategic Policies (2012), Policies DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2- Development Management Policies (2020), Policies D1, D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The proposed development, by virtue of its proximity, excessive depth, scale, bulk and height, would cause an unacceptable loss of outlook, loss of light, sense of enclosure and overbearing impact to the neighbouring properties at Nos. 9 and 15 Thornhill Road and No. 24 Stedman Close to the detriment of their internal and external living conditions. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policy BE 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One- Strategic Policies (2012), Policy DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2- Development Management Policies (2020) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "In the absence of a flood risk assessment, the proposal, which partially falls in Flood Zone 2, fails to demonstrate how the risk and effects of flooding at the site would be managed to ensure that the development is safe for its lifetime. Furthermore, no sequential test has been submitted to demonstrate that there are no reasonably available sites in areas with a lower risk of flooding. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy DMEI 9 and DMEI 10 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020), Policies SI 12 and SI 13 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan - The Spatial Development Strategy for London consolidated with alterations since 2011 (2016) and national guidance.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "a) We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal.",
    "This is a reminder that Under the terms of the Planning Act 2008 (as amended) and Community Infrastructure Levy Regulations 2010 (as amended), should an application for appeal be allowed, the proposed development would be deemed as 'chargeable development' and therefore liable to pay the London Borough of Hillingdon Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and the Mayor of London's Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This would be calculated in accordance with the London Borough of Hillingdon CIL Charging Schedule 2014 and the Mayor of London's CIL Charging Schedule 2012.",
