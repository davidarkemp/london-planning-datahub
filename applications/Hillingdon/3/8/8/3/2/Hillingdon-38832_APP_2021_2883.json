    "The proposed part single storey, part two storey front/side/rear extension, by reason of its size, scale, bulk, height, depth, width and proximity to the side boundary, would result in the closing of a visually important gap between 61 and 63 New Road, giving rise to a cramped form of development and possible terracing effect, which would be detrimental to the visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area generally. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies, as well as paragraphs 130 (a) and (c) of the NPPF (2021).",
    "The proposed part single storey, part two storey front/side/rear extension, by reason of its size, scale, bulk, width and design, would result in a disproportionate and visually dominant addition to the dwelling which would fail to harmonise with its original architectural composition, subsequently causing significant harm to its appearance and the visual amenities of the street scene and surrounding area. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020) as well as paragraphs 130 (a) and (c) of the NPPF (2021).",
    "The proposed two storey rear extension, by virtue of its size, scale, bulk, depth and proximity, would be detrimental to the amenities of the adjoining occupier at 65 New Road by reason of overdominance, visual intrusion and loss of outlook. Therefore, the proposal would be contrary to Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020)."
