    "The proposed development by reason of its bulk, size, siting, scale, design and massing would result in dominant, poorly designed, disproportionate outbuilding that fails to read as subordinate to the original dwelling and respect its architectural composition. The cumulative impact, overall footprint and excessive bulk would also fail to harmonise with the established local context, having a harmful visual impact on the character and appearance of the Eastcote Village Conservation Area and wider area. It would fail to either preserve or enhance the character of the conservation area, and there are no public benefits that would outweigh the identified less than substantial harm. The proposal would therefore be contrary Policies BE1 and HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012), Policies DMHB 1, DMHB 4, and DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two- Development Management Policies (2020), Policies HC1, D3, and D4 of the London Plan (2021) and Paragraphs",
    "The proposed outbuilding, by reason of its siting, combined height, width and depth, would result in harm to the occupiers of no.22 and no. 26 Cheney Street in terms of overdominance and loss of outlook. The proposal would fail to comply with the requirements of Policies DMHD 1, DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "In the absence of a tree report and arboricultural implications assessment (to BS5837:2012), the proposal has failed to demonstrate that protected trees will be unaffected by the development proposals. Therefore, the proposal would be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012), Policies D3 and G7 of the London Plan (2021), Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 14 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2021). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020."
