    "The proposal, by reason of the siting and number of proposed front rooflights and removal of the rear chimney stack, would appear obtrusive within the street scene, detracting from the architectural integrity of the host dwelling and causing a detrimental impact on the character and appearance of the Greenway Conservation Area. Consequently, the proposal would be contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2023), Policy D4 of the London Plan (2021), Policies BE1 and HC1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012), and Policies DMHB 4, DMHB 11, DMHB 12, and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "In order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably. In addition further guidance was offered to the applicant by the case officer during the processing of the application to identify the amendments to address those elements of the scheme considered unacceptable which the applicant chose not to implement."
