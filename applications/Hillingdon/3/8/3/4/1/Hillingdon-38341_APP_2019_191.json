    "The details received pursuant to condition 5 (Tree Protection Measures) are considered insufficient. The proposal fails to provide a tree protection plan, identifying the alignment and specification of protective fencing or an arboricultural method statement. In its current form, it is not considered that sufficient information has been received to demonstrate that the proposal would ensure that trees and other vegetation can and will be retained on site and not damaged during construction works. In the absence of such, the scheme fails to comply with Policy BE38 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two Saved UDP Policies (November 2012)",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the 'Saved' UDP 2007, Local Plan Part 1, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service."
