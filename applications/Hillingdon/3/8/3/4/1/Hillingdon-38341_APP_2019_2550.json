The proposal fails to provide a tree protection plan, identifying the alignment and specification of protective fencing or an arboricultural method statement. In its current form, it is not considered that sufficient information has been received to demonstrate that the proposal would ensure that trees and other vegetation can and will be retained on site and not damaged during construction works. In the absence of such, the scheme fails to comply with Policy BE38 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two Saved UDP Policies (November 2012).",
