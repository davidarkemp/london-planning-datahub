Therefore, if applicable, it is advisable to consult your tree surgeon / consultant to agree an acceptable time for carrying out the approved works.",
    "Owner(s)'s permission:  Permission should be sought from the owner(s) of the tree(s) and / or the owner(s) of the land that the tree(s) overhang prior to any approved work being carried out.",
    "Expected standard of tree work: The approved works must be carried out in accordance with the conditions laid out above. If they are not, then enforcement action could being taken which could lead to prosecution and heavy fines. Therefore, it is highly recommended that the works are only carried out by a professional and competent arboriculturist who undertakes to comply with the conditions of this consent and in accordance with industry best practice (BS 3998:2010). The Arboricultural Association can provide details of its approved contractors, who have demonstrated such professionalism and competence, on their website (www.trees.org.uk) or by calling 01242 522152. Or on request the Council can provide a list of contractors who are known to carry out tree work to a good standard and to normally maintain an appropriate policy of indemnity insurance.",

    "The Lawson Cypress (group 3 on application) is split into 2 different protections on TPO 90, group 1 is the hedge to the side of the front garden and T100 the tree to the front of the front garden. The trees are highly visible from the private road, and as such have a moderate amenity value and significantly contribute to the arboricultural character of the area.",
    "With regard to the proposed reduction in height of Lawson Cypress (T100), this tree is a multi-stem and no evidence has been provided that would suggest it is unstable. The tree currently has a natural attractive crown which a reduction in height would ruin.",
    "Having regard to the reasons given for the proposed reduction in height of T100, the works are unnecessary, unjustified and will have a detrimental impact on the visual amenity and arboreal character of the local area."
