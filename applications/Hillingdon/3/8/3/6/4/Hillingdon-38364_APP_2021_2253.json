    "The proposed dwelling, by reason of its size, scale, bulk, height, width and design in this open prominent position, would fail to appear as a subordinate addition and would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original dwelling, would be detrimental to the character, appearance and symmetry of the the small terrace of dwellings of which it forms a part and to the visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 11 and  DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and Policies D4 and D8 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "The proposal fails to provide a double bedroom of sufficient size and would therefore give rise to a substandard form of living accommodation to the detriment of the amenity of future occupiers. The proposal is thus contrary to Policy DMHB 16 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy D6 and Table 3.1 of the London Plan (2021), the Mayor of London's adopted Supplementary Planning Guidance - Housing (March 2016) and the Technical Housing Standards - Nationally Described Space Standard (March 2015).",
    "The proposed development, by virtue of its size, scale, bulk, design and proximity, would be detrimental to the amenities of the adjoining occupier at 16A Birch Avenue by reason of overdominance, visual intrusion and loss of outlook. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to policies Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 11 and  DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The proposal results in additional parking in excess of this Council's maximum adopted parking standards. As such the proposal represents an unsustainable form of development, which conflicts with Policy T6 of the London Plan (2021) by encouraging the use of the private car.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal.",
    "This is a reminder that Under the terms of the Planning Act 2008 (as amended) and Community Infrastructure Levy Regulations 2010 (as amended), should an application for appeal be allowed, the proposed development would be deemed as 'chargeable development' and therefore liable to pay the London Borough of Hillingdon Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and the Mayor of London's Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This would be calculated in accordance with the London Borough of Hillingdon CIL Charging Schedule 2014 and the Mayor of London's CIL Charging Schedule 2012.
