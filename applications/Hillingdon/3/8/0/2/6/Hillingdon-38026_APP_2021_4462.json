    "The proposed front/side extension, by virtue of its siting, combined height, width and forward projection including the wrap-around nature would result in a dominant, incongruous, visually intrusive, disproportionate and bulky addition that would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original dwelling, would be detrimental to the character, appearance and symmetry of the semi-detached pair of no.50 Lowlands Road of which it forms a part and to the visual amenities of this prominent street scene siting and the surrounding area. Therefore, the proposal would be contrary to Policy D1, D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021), Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012) and Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2021). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020."
