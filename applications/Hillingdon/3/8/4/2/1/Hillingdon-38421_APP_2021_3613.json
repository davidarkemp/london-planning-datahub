    "D. No bonfires that create dark smoke or nuisance to local residents.",
    "You are advised to consult the Council's Environmental Protection Unit (https://archive.hillingdon",
    "Demolition and removal of any material containing asbestos must be carried out in accordance with guidance from the Health and Safety Executive and the Council's Environmental Services. For advice and information contact: - Environmental Protection Unit, 3S/02, Civic Centre, High Street, Uxbridge, UB8 1UW (Tel. 01895 277401) or the Health and Safety Executive, Rose Court, 2 Southwark Bridge Road, London, SE1 9HS (Tel. 020 7556 2100).",
    "It is advised that any works associated with this prior notification application should be conducted in accordance with a detailed watching brief/discovery strategy to deal with unforeseen contamination that may be encountered, particularly during preliminary ground work and excavations at the site.",
    "The applicant/developer should refer to the current \"Code of Practice for Works affecting the Canal & River Trust\" to ensure that any necessary consents are obtained (http://canalrivertrust.org.uk/about-us/for-businesses/undertaking-works-on-our-property).",
    "The Environmental Permitting (England and Wales) Regulations 2016 require a permit to be obtained for any activities which will take place:",

The applicant must ensure that the proposed works do not infringe on legal rights of access and or restrictive covenants that exist.",
    "If buildings or structures are proposed directly above the apparatus the development may only take place following diversion of the apparatus. The applicant should apply online to have apparatus diverted in advance of any works, by visiting cadentgas.com/diversions",
    "Prior to carrying out works, including the construction of access points, please register on www.linesearchbeforeudig.co.uk to submit details of the planned works for review, ensuring requirements are adhered to.",
