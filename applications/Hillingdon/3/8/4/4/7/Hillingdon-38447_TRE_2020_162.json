    "Refused  - To fell and grind One Spruce (T2 on application) within Area 1 on TPO 394.",
    "Approved - To fell and grind Eight Cypresses (T1 and G2 on application) all within Area 1 on TPO 394",
    "The Cypress (T1 on application) is situated within the front garden of 8 Lowswood Close but taking into account its current condition it has a moderate amenity value. The Spruce (T2 on application) is situated within the rear garden but to the side of the property and as a result can be seen from the road and has a Moderate-to-High amenity value. The row of 7 cypresses (G2 on application) is situated within the rear garden and can only be viewed from the neighbouring properties and are overshadowed by the adjacent larger Oak trees as a result they have a combined low amenity value. All the trees contribute to the arboricultural character of the Copse wood estate (Area of special local character).",
    "With regard to the proposed felling of the Spruce (T2 on application), The tree has a natural crown typical of this species. The reasons provided for removal include to allow more light, however due to the tree's form I do not believe it is casting much of a shadow and the majority of the shad",
    "No felling shall take place until such time as a scheme has been submitted to, and approved in writing by, the Local Planning Authority for a replacement tree within the front garden as a replacement for one cypress (T1 on application), which shall be of 'Standard' size (about 2-3m high) and short-staked for support. The replacement tree shall be planted during the first planting season following the felling works hereby permitted. Thereafter, the replacement tree(s) shall be retained indefinitely and maintained (watered and weeded during the spring and summer) for 2-3 years, or until established.",
    "REASON",
    "In order to comply with the requirements of Section 206 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990.",
    "The removal of deadwood, dangerous / hanging branches and ivy:  This does not require the formal consent of the Council.",
    "Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981:  Note that it is an offence under this act to disturb roosting bats, nesting birds or any other protected species.  Therefore, if applicable, it is advisable to consult your tree surgeon / consultant to agree an acceptable time for carrying out the approved works."
