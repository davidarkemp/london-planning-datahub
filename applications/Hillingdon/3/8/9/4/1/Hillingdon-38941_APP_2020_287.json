  "description": "Two storey rear extension and single storey side extension, single storey side extension to existing detached garage, part conversion of garage to habitable use including alterations to front elevation, erection of cycle and garden store, provision of bin store and provision of photovoltaic panels to roof of garage and roof of cycle and garden store.",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed two storey rear extension, by reason of its siting in this visually prominent position, its size, scale, bulk and design including its roof profile would result in an incongruous and overly dominant addition which would be detrimental to the architectural composition of the original building, the visual amenities of the street scene and the character and appearance of the wider Area. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHD 1, DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The proposed side extensions by reason of their siting in this open prominent position, their size, scale, bulk, height and proximity to the side boundaries, would result in the closing of important gaps characteristic to the area, resulting in a cramped appearance. The proposal would therefore represent an overdevelopment of the site to the detriment of the visual amenities of the street scene and the character and appearance of the surrounding area. The proposed development is therefore contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies.",

We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service. No pre-application advice was sought but the agent met the planning officer and discussed the previous refusal application. As such, the applicant would have been aware of the previous reasons for refusal."
