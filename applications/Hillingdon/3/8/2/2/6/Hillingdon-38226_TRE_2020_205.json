    "The Hornbeams border the rear garden of 2 The Covert. They have attractive, natural-looking crowns typical of their species. The trees significantly contribute to local biodiversity and significantly contribute to the amenity and arboreal character of the Copse wood Estate (Area of Special Local Character). The benefit in amenity and biodiversity afforded by the trees is both present and future because they have the potential for a long life expectancy. Collectively, the trees have a high amenity value.",
    "The group of Hornbeams form a significant landscape feature behind the house. The proposed pruning would reduce the size and amenity value of the trees and would also give them an unwelcome 'managed' appearance.",
    "Having regard to the reasons given for the proposed work, the work is unjustified and will have a detrimental impact on the visual amenity and arboreal character of the area.",
