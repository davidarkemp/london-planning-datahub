    "The proposed resulting roof form, to include the hip to gable roof extension, hipped roof form of the side/rear extension, and rear dormer window, by reason of their cumulative size, scale, bulk, massing and design, would appear as a disproportionate and incongruous form of development that would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original semi-detached dwelling, would be detrimental to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the street scene and the wider area.  The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies BE1  of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 1, DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policies D4 and D8  of the London Plan (2021) and the NPPF (July 2021).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
