    "Due to its size, site coverage, unsympathetic design, the proposed dwelling would form an uncharacteristic, cramped and visually incongruous form of development which would fail to harmonise with the established character of the area. The proposal would therefore be detrimental to the character of the surrounding area and would cause harm to its appearance, contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies, Policies DMH 6, DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policies D1 and D3 of the London Plan (2021), as well as paragraphs 124 and 130 of the NPPF (2021).",
    "Due to its height, width and orientation, the proposal would lead to a loss of outlook from the rear windows of No.25 Rockingham Parade and the flats at Barnsfield Place and creating an uncomfortable and poor residential environment for these neighbours, harming their amenities. The proposal is therefore considered to be contrary to policies DMHB 11 of the Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020) and paragraph 130 (f) of the NPPF (2021).",
    "The proposed dwelling fails to provide sufficient external amenity space for its future occupants resulting in a substandard form of external accommodation for its future occupiers, to the detriment of their amenities. The proposal is therefore considered to be create a poor quality residential environment, contrary to the requirements of Policy DMHB 18 of the Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020) and Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate that the existing garages are not in use, are not required by existing residents or that the parking needs of their owners/users can or are being met elsewhere. Demolition of the garages could lead to the displacement of 6 vehicles on to the local highways network.  Roadside parking could lead to pedestrians having to walk into the road to get around parked cars, this would endanger them and create a more hazardous environment for car users. Roadside parking would also cause traffic build up and congestion as vehicles stop to pass parked vehicles. It could also result in vehicles parking in unfavourable places causing nuisance to local residents and vehicle users. The proposed development is therefore considered to be contrary to Policies DMT 2 and DMT 6 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), as well as policy T4 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan (2021)."
