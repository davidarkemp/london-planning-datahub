    "Due to its height, design and close proximity to No.23 Rockingham Parade, the proposed dwelling would give rise to significant overlooking with unimpeded views into the rear windows of the mentioned property, causing a unacceptable loss of privacy to its occupiers, which would harm their amenities. For the same reasons the new dwelling would also provide overlooking views into rear garden of No. 23 Rockingham parade, causing a further loss of privacy to the detriment of the neighbours amenities. The two storey glazed stairwell window would face directly toward the rear windows of No.25 Rockingham Parade, due to its size and design it would give the occupants of No.25 the perception of being overlooked, creating an uncomfortable residential environment for the occupants of the property and harming their amenities. The proposal would also lead to a loss of views from the rear windows of No.25 Rockingham Parade and the flats at Barnsfield Place harming the amenities of the occupiers of th",
    "The proposed dwelling fails to provide sufficient external amenity space and internal floorspace for its future occupants resulting in a substandard form of accommodation for its future occupiers, to the detriment of their amenities. The proposal is therefore considered to be create a poor quality residential environment, contrary to the requirements of Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021) and Policy DMHB 18 of the Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate that the existing garages are not in use, are not required by existing residents or that the parking needs of their owners are being met elsewhere. Demolition of the garages could lead to the displacement of 6 vehicles on to the local highways network.  Roadside parking could lead to pedestrians having to walk into the road to get around parked cars, this would endanger them and create a more hazardous environment for car users. Roadside parking would also cause traffic build up and congestion as vehicles stop to pass parked vehicles. It could also result in vehicles parking in unfavourable places causing nuisance to local residents and vehicle users. The proposed development is therefore considered to be contrary to Policies DMT 2 and DMT 6 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), as well as policy T4 of the London Plan (2021).",
