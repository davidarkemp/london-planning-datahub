    "The proposed roof extension by virtue of its excessive height and bulk, would have an incongruous impact on terraces to either side, and as such would have an adverse impact upon the terrace as a whole and the street scene. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "In the absence of a set of existing and proposed detailed floor plans, it is not possible to assess the potential impact the additional residential floorspace may have on key material considerations and the applications conformity to the development plan.  As such the proposed development fails to comply with The Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), The Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), The London Plan (2021) and the NPPF (2023)",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the 'Saved' UDP 2007, Local Plan Part 1, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service. This is a resubmission of a previously refused scheme, where the Inspectors Report identified issues to be addressed, which were reflected in the reasons for refusal, allowing the opportunity to address those issues within this submission.",
    "The applicant is advised that the subdivision of the first and second floor maisonette into 2 separate flats requires planning permission and is vulnerable to enforcement action being taken by the Council.",

We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
