  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed roof extensions by reason of their position, size, scale, bulk, design and massing would result in overly dominant and incongruous additions, detrimental to the architectural composition, form, character and appearance of the original property and the visual amenities of the street scene and the wider area. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy BE1 of Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2016). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020."
