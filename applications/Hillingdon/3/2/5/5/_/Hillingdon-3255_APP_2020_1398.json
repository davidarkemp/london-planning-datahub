  "description": "Part two storey, part single storey rear extension with Juliette balcony involving demolition of existing extension and conversion of roof space to habitable use to include 2 x rear dormers, 2 x front dormers, 7 x roof light and conversion of roof from hip to gable end with alterations to fenestration, hard standing to front, associated refuse and recycling store including rebuilding of existing garage.",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed two storey rear extension by reason of its position, size, scale, bulk, design and massing would result in overly dominant and incongruous addition, detrimental to the architectural composition, form, character and appearance of the original property and the visual amenities of the wider area. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy BE1 of Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHD 1 and DMHB 11 of the Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The proposed roof extensions by reason of their position, size, scale, bulk, design and massing, along with the cumulative impact of the two storey rear extension, would result in overly dominant and incongruous additions, detrimental to the architectural composition, form, character and appearance of the original property and the visual amenities of the street scene and the wider area. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy BE1 of Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and policies DMHD 1 and DMHB 11 of the Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The proposed extension by reason of its proximity to the boundary would result in an unacceptable reduction in the light received by the adjacent bedroom window at the neighbouring property, 16 St Edmunds Avenue, in addition to which the extension would appear as an overbearing and visually intrusive feature which would result in an unacceptable loss of outlook. The proposal would be contrary to Policy BE1 of Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHD 1 and DMHB 11 of the Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan - The Spatial Development Strategy for London consolidated with alterations since 2011 (2016) and national guidance.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the 'Saved' UDP 2007, Local Plan Part 1, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2016). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020."
