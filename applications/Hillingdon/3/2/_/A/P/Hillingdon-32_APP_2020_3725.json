  "description": "First floor rear extension.",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed first floor extension by reason of its bulk, size, siting, flat roofed design and unsympathetic fenestration would fail to respect the character of the host building and the surrounding area, contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan - Part 1 (November 2012), Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan - Part Two (2020) and Policies D1 and D3 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "The proposed first floor rear extension by reason of the first floor door which provides access to the flat roofed area to the rear would result in an unacceptable loss of amenity to neighbouring residential occupiers as a result of increased noise, general disturbance and loss of privacy, in conflict with the requirements of Policy DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan - Part Two (2020).",
    "The proposed first floor rear extension, by virtue of its scale, position and design would result in an unacceptable loss of amenity to neighbouring residential occupiers at no. 93a and no. 93 Wood End Green Road as a result of overshadowing, loss of light, harm to outlook and overbearing impact. As such, the proposal is contrary to Policy DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 (2020).",
    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate with the submission of accurate drawings that the proposed development would provide quality residential accommodation for existing and future occupiers of 95 Wood End Green Road contrary to Policies DMHB 11 and DMHB 16 of the Hillingdon Local Plan - Part Two (2020) and Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
