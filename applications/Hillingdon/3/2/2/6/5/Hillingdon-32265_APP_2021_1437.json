    "The proposed development by reason of its siting, size, scale, bulk, massing, height and design would result in a cramped, incongruous and visually obtrusive form of development. The proposal would therefore cause significant harm to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the surrounding area and the wider Old Northwood Area of Special Local Character. The proposal would therefore be contrary to  Policies BE1 and HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012), Policies  DMHB 5, DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two- Development Management Policies (2020), Policies HC1, D1, D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The proposed development, by virtue of its proximity, size, scale, bulk, massing, height, design and inclusion of a roof terrace, would cause harm to the living conditions of the neighbouring residential occupiers at numbers 76, 78, 80 and 80b High Street, in terms of outlook, light, privacy, overlooking, overbearing impact and sense of enclosure. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012), Policy DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two- Development Management Policies (2020) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The proposed development, by virtue of its poor outlook, poor levels of natural light and lack of privacy would result in a substandard form of residential accommodation to the detriment of the amenity of future occupants. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policy DMHB 16 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The proposed development would not provide any three or more bedroom (family sized) units. Robust justification has not been provided to demonstrate that the provision of family sized units would be unsuitable or unviable. The proposal would therefore not provide a suitable mix of housing to support sustainable, inclusive and mixed communities, contrary to Policy DMH 2 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy H10 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The proposed development, by virtue of the site layout, access arrangements, internal design of the building, and absence of details to show that the internal layout would comply with Building Regulation requirement M4(2) and M4(3), fails to demonstrate that adequate provision would be provided to meet the needs of people with disabilities. The proposed development therefore conflicts with Policies D5 and D7 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The proposal fails to demonstrate how the development would achieve the highest standards of fire safety in regard to its design in incorporating appropriate features which reduce the risk to life in the event of a fire, its construction methods, means of escape, strategy of evacuation and providing suitable access and equipment for firefighting appropriate for the size and residential nature of the development. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policies D5 and D11 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "Insufficient evidence has been provided to demonstrate that adequate refuse and recycling facilities for the proposed development and the existing retail unit could be accommodated within the curtilage of the site. The proposal would therefore conflict with Policy DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan (2021) and national guidance.",
    "This is a reminder that under the terms of the Planning Act 2008 (as amended) and Community Infrastructure Levy Regulations 2010 (as amended), should an application for appeal be allowed, the proposed development would be deemed as 'chargeable development' and therefore liable to pay the London Borough of Hillingdon Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and the Mayor of London's Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This would be calculated in accordance with the London Borough of Hillingdon CIL Charging Schedule 2014 and the Mayor of London's CIL Charging Schedule 2019.
