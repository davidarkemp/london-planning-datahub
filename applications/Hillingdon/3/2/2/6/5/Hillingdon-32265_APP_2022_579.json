    "The proposed development,  by reason of its backland siting, size, scale, bulk, massing, height and design would result in a cramped, incongruous and visually obtrusive form of development. The proposal would therefore cause significant harm to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the surrounding area and the wider Old Northwood Area of Special Local Character. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policies BE1 and HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012), Policies DMHB 5, DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two- Development Management Policies (2020), Policies HC1, D1, D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The proposed development, by virtue of its proximity, size, scale, bulk, massing, height and design would cause harm to the living conditions of the neighbouring residential occupiers at numbers 76, 78, 80 and 80b High Street, in terms of loss of outlook, perceived and actual loss of privacy, overbearing impact and sense of enclosure. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012), Policy DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two- Development Management Policies (2020) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The proposed dwellings, by virtue of their poor outlook, lack of defensible space, unacceptable refuse storage arrangements and contrived layout, would result in a substandard form of residential accommodation to the detriment of the amenity of future occupants. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policies DMHB 11 and DMHB 16 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The proposed development would not provide any three or more bedroom (family sized) units. Notwithstanding the submission of a Planning Statement, no robust justification has been provided to demonstrate that the provision of family sized units would be unsuitable or unviable. The proposal would therefore not provide a suitable mix of housing to support sustainable, inclusive and mixed communities, contrary to Policy DMH 2 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy H10 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The proposed development, by virtue of its failure to provide private external amenity space of a sufficient size, function and quality, would give rise to a substandard form of living accommodation to the detriment of the amenity of future occupiers of the proposed dwellings. The proposal therefore conflicts with Policy DMHB 18 of of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The proposal fails to demonstrate how the development would achieve the highest standards of fire safety in regard to its design in incorporating appropriate features which reduce the risk to life in the event of a fire, its construction methods, means of escape, strategy of evacuation and providing suitable access and equipment for firefighting appropriate for the size and residential nature of the development. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policies D5, D11 and D12 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The proposed development, by virtue of the site layout, access arrangements, internal design of the building, and absence of details to show that the internal layout would comply with Building Regulation requirement M4(2) and M4(3), fails to demonstrate that adequate provision would be provided to meet the needs of people with disabilities. The proposed development therefore conflicts with Policies D5 and D7 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021)."
