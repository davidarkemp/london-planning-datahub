    "The proposed outbuilding by reason of its excessive footprint, design and scale would fail to appear as a subordinate addition to the site and would be detrimental to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the surrounding area. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies DMHD 2 and DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "The proposed outbuilding, by virtue of its size, design and proximity, would be detrimental to the amenities of the adjoining occupiers at 12 and 16 Trevor Crescent, by reason of visual intrusion, loss of privacy and overlooking. Therefore, the proposal would be contrary to Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 2 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and paragraph 130(f) of the NPPF (2021).",
    "In the absence of a Flood Risk Assessment, the application has failed to demonstrate that it can satisfy the requirements of Policy DMEI 9 and Policy DMEI 10 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) which seek to control the risk or consequences of surface water flooding.",
    "The proposed development would be disproportionate to the garden curtilage in which it would sit and would unacceptably reduce the area of private amenity space available to the occupiers of the host dwelling, thereby resulting in a substandard form of accommodation contrary to policies DMHD 1, DMHD 2, DMHB 11 and DMHB 18 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan (2021)."
