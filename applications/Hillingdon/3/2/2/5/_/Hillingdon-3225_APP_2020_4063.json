  "description": "Part two storey, part single storey side/rear extension and first floor side extension involving demolition of existing garage",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed extensions, by reason of their siting in this open prominent position, size, scale, bulk and design would represent a visually unsympathetic form of development that would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original and adjoining dwellings and would be detrimental to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "In the absence of a robust Flood Risk Assessment in accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework and National Planning Practice Guidance, the application has failed to address the issues relating to flood risk and the proposal is therefore contrary to Policy EM6 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policy DMEI9 of the Hillingdon Local Plan - Part Two (2020) and Policy LPP SI12 of the London Plan (2021) and the NPPF (2021).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
