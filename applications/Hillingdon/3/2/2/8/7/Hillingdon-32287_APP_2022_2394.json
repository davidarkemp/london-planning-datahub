  "description": "Erection of single storey extension to front, side and rear following demolition of existing garage",
  "decision_date": "21/10/2022",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "Due to its width, bulk and design the proposed front/side extension would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original dwelling and  would be significantly harmful to the appearance of the original dwelling, unbalancing the visual symmetry which exists between No.13 and 15 Rushdene Road, causing harm to the character and appearance of the streetscene and surrouding area. For these reasons the proposal conflicts with Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHD 1, DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
