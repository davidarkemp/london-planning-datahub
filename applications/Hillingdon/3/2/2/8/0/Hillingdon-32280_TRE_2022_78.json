    "The Cypress is situated within the front garden of 52 Gatehill Road, it significantly contributes to the Arboricultural character of the Gatehill Estate Area of Special Local Character and has a Moderate amenity value.",
    "An application to reduce the cypress by 6m in height and trim the sides was approved in January 2022. The height reduction was deemed appropriate to improve the trees form and has been completed. This current application now wishes to fell the Cypress to give clearance to the property, allow more light and allow replanting. The Cypress is situated in the Northwest of the property and now has a compact canopy, it is not believed that removal will significantly increase the level of light within the property. There is adequate clearance between the tree and the property which can be maintained by regular trimming of the sides (subject to an application).",
    "Having regard to the reasons given for the proposed work, the work is unjustified and will have a detrimental impac",
    "The removal of deadwood, dangerous / hanging branches and ivy:  This does not require the formal consent of the Council."
