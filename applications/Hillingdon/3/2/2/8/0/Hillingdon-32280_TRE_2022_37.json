    "T1 Scots Pine is situated within the back garden of 52 Gatehill Road. This tree presents a mature and attractive crown, which is visible from the road over the roof of the property, and from the nearby gardens in Gatehill Road, Wieland Road and Woodgate Crescent. T59 Silver Birch and T63 Monterey Cypress are mature trees located at the front of house 52 and at the front of house 54 respectively. The trees represent a defining feature of the Gatehill Farm Estate, an Area of Special Local Character thanks also to its mature and diverse tree cover. These trees have a high amenity value, thereby making a significant positive contribution to the local landscape.",
    "No evidence has been put forward concerning the need to remove T1 Scots Pine and T59 Birch. From the photos provided and the Tree Officer's assessment from the road, the trees appear in good condition and no reason has been provided for the proposed removal of the trees. In relation to the pruning of the side facing house 52 of T63",
