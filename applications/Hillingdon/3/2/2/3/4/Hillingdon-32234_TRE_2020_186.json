  "description": "To carry out tree surgery including a crown thin by 30% and lift to 5m, One Oak (T2 on application), within area 1 on TPO 130.",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The Oak tree is highly visible from Eastbury Road and as a result has a high amenity value. It significantly contributes to the arboricultural character of the local area both now and in the future as it has the potential for a long life.",
    "We received two separate applications to carry out slightly different work to this Oak tree. The other application (32234/TRE/2020/206) was to crown reduce by 1.5m and deadwood. This work is seen as a better specification and as a result was approved. A crown thin by 30% could lead to lion-tailing and as a result could have a detrimental effect on the health of the tree.",
    "Having regard to the reasons given for the proposed work, the work is unjustified and will have a detrimental impact on the visual amenity and arboreal character of the area.",
    "The removal of deadwood, dangerous / hanging branches and ivy:  This does not require the formal consent of the Council."
