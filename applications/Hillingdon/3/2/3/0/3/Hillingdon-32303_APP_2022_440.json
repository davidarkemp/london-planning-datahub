    "The proposed single storey rear extension, by virtue of its excessive depth, scale, bulk and the amalgmation of the proposed extension and the existing detached garage, would represent a disproportionate addition to the host building that would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original dwelling. The proposal would therefore be detrimental to the character and appearance of the host dwelling, and the visual amenities of the surrounding area and the character and appearance of the streetscene contrary to the requirements of Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2021). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020."
