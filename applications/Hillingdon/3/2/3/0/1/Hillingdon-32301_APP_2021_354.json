  "description": "Single storey rear link extension from dwelling to pool house (Retrospective)",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed single storey rear linked extension, by virtue of its size, scale, bulk, excessive depth and close proximity to the boundary with the adjoining property, would overwhelm and detract from the modest footprint of the host dwelling and be detrimental to the amenities of the adjoining occupier at 111 Sweetcroft Lane by reason of overdominance, overshadowing, visual intrusion and loss of outlook. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2016). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020."
