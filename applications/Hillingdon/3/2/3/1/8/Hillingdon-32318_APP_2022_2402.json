    "Due to its excessive height, width, bulk and poor design the proposed extension would form an insubordinate and visually unsympathetic addition to the original dwellinghouse, causing signficant harm to its character and appearance. As such, the proposal would be contrary to Policy BE 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One Strategic Policies (2012) and Policy DMHD 1 and DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "Due to the combination of its poor design, excessive width, height and corner plot siting, the proposed extension would form an unduly prominent, uncharacteristic and ultimately harmful addition to the street scene and surrounding area. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12, DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020) and paragraph 130 of the NPPF (2021).",
    "Due to its semi private design and extremely limited size (approximately 23sqm), the external amenity space resulting from the proposed development is considered to be substandard and of poor quality, harming the amenities of the existing and future occupiers of No.50 Woodstock Gardens. The proposal is therefore considered to be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One Strategic Policies (2012) and Policies DMHD 1, DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and paragraph 130 (f) of the NPPF 2021.",
    "The proposed extension by virtue of its excessive width, height, depth and siting (along the entirety of the boundary shared with No.52 Woodstock Gardens), would be detrimental to the amenities of the existing and future occupiers of 52 Woodstock Gardens, by reason of visual intrusion, overdominance, loss of outlook, loss of light and overshadowing. Therefore, the proposal would be contrary to Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and paragraph 130 (f) of the NPPF(2021).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
