    "The proposed two storey side/rear extension, by reason of its scale, bulk, width and flat roofed design would result in an incongruous addition which would would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original dwelling, would be detrimental to the character, appearance and symmetry of the pair of semi-detached houses of which it forms a part and to the visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the  Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021) and Chapter 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The proposed two storey side/rear extension, by reason of its bulk, size, siting and proximity to the shared boundary would harm the existing living conditions of 66 Denbigh Drive by virtue of a loss of outlook and a harmful sense of enclosure, contrary to Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the  Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service."
