    "The proposed extensions, by reason of their siting in this visually prominent position, size, scale, bulk and design, including the formation of a large crown roof, would result in incongruous additions which would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original dwelling and would result in a property that would be over-sized and over-dominant for the location, detrimental to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policy BE1, HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies BE5, BE6, BE13, BE15 and BE19 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Unitary Development Plan Saved Policies (November 2012) and policies DMHD 1, DMHB 1, 5 and 6 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies with Modifications (March 2019), and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document HDAS: Residential Extensions.",
    "The proposal, by reason of its siting, size, scale, width and proximity to the side boundary with No. 19 The Broadwalk would result in the loss of an important gap characteristic to the area, resulting in a cramped appearance, detrimental to the visual amenities of the street scene and the character and appearance of the surrounding area. The proposed development is therefore contrary to Policies BE1 and HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies BE13, BE19 and BE22 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Saved UDP Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHD 1, DMHB 1, 5 and 6 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies with Modifications (March 2019) and the Council's adopted Supplementary Planning Document HDAS: Residential Extensions.",
    "The proposed development, by virtue of its size, scale, depth, height and design, would be detrimental to the amenities of the adjoining occupier at No. 19 The Broadwalk by reason of being overdominant and overbearing, combined with a loss of sunlight. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policies BE19, BE20 and BE21 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Saved UDP Policies (November 2012) and policy DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies with Modifications (March 2019), and the Council's adopted Supplementary Planning Document HDAS: Residential Extensions.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the 'Saved' UDP 2007, Local Plan Part 1, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.  No further pre-application advice (further to initial advice given in 2017) was sought.   However the applicant would have been aware of the previous reasons for refusal."
