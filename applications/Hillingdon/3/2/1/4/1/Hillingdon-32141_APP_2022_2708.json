    "The proposed extensions by reason of their siting, scale, bulk and design would fail to read as a subordinate addition to the house and respect its architectural integrity. Given the prominent corner position of the site, the side extension would also result in the closing of an important gap characteristic to the area, fail to respect the established return building line and overall result in harm the established character and appearance of the area. The proposal would therefore represent an overdevelopment of the site to the detriment of the visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area, all contrary to Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
