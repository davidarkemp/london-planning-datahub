    "The Oak tree is located within the back garden of 39 Oak Avenue. The Oak is a prominent landscape feature in a historical and conservation area, and a landmark trees in Oak Avenue, which inherited the name from the presence of Oak trees of which there are now a few left. The tree has a high visibility from the road and adjacent properties and has a moderate-to-high amenity value, thus significantly contributing to the visual amenity and arboreal character of the local area. A petition, forty-two formal objections and three comments, were submitted by residents within Oak Avenue, Parkfield Road and other adjacent roads, all objecting the removal of this tree.",
    "The applicant has provided written arboricultural advice from a company called ROAVR Environmental, who carried out a visual inspection of the tree. The report stated that the tree shows \"reasonable vitality\", but that it should be removed on safety grounds, as a wound which was caused by a lightning decades ago shows decay, delam",
