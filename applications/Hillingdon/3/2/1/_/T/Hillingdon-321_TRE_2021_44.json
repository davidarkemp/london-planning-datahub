  "description": "To fell one Oak T13 on TPO 514",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "Amenity: The Oak is one of the few landmark trees in Oak Avenue. It is an individual tree with a high visibility from the road and a strong arboreal character in the area, which is currently deprived of mature trees. The benefit in amenity and biodiversity offered by the tree is high, being it one of the last remnants of Quercus robur in the Avenue. The Oak has a moderate-to-high amenity value.",
    "Appraisal: The applicant refers to the large crack in the trunk having increasingly grown larger but no evidence has been provided of this increase. Moreover, the applicant refers to leaning of the tree getting worse due to storm damage but no evidence of this change in tree leaning has been provided. Furthermore, no arboricultural report has been provided to demonstrate the cavity internal depth and the amount of sound wood present.",
    "Conclusion: Having regard to the reasons given for the proposed work, the work is unjustified and will have a detrimental impact on the visual amenity and arbore",
    "The removal of deadwood, dangerous / hanging branches and ivy:  This does not require the formal consent of the Council.",
    "Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981:  Note that it is an offence under this act to disturb roosting bats, nesting birds or any other protected species.  Therefore, if applicable, it is advisable to consult your tree surgeon / consultant to agree an acceptable time for carrying out the approved works."
