The absence of a functional parking layout could lead to roadside parking which would hinder vehicle movements in the area leading to traffic build up to the detriment of the highways network. It would also create a more hazardous environment for pedestrians and vehicle users, as cars at the site are reverse onto the road, due to insufficient or poor manoeuvring space. The absence of a functional parking plan is also likely to reduce the ability of neighbours (No.4 Forris Avenue) to use their parking space; leading to more roadside parking.
