    "The proposed development, by reason of its siting, size, scale, layout, width and detailed design would constitute a cramped form of development which would not be in keeping with the prevailing character of residential dwellings in the area and would unbalance the",
    "appearance of the detached property to which it would adjoin. The proposal would therefore be detrimental to the visual amenities of the streetscene and the character of the Conservation Area, contrary to Policy BE1 and HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012), DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management",
    "Policies (2020), Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021), as well as paragraphs 130 of the NPPF (2021).",
    "Insufficient private amenity space would be provided for the proposed dwelling, resulting in a poor standard of accommodation for future occupiers, contrary to Policy DMHB 18 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020) and paragraph 130(f) of the NPPF (2021).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service. We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal.",
    "This is a reminder that Under the terms of the Planning Act 2008 (as amended) and Community Infrastructure Levy Regulations 2010 (as amended), should an application for appeal be allowed, the proposed development would be deemed as 'chargeable development' and therefore liable to pay the London Borough of Hillingdon Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and the Mayor of London's Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This would be calculated in accordance with the London Borough of Hillingdon CIL Charging Schedule 2014 and the Mayor of London's CIL Charging Schedule 2012.",
