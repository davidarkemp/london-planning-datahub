    "The applicant has failed to submit satisfactory details and clarity relating to hard and soft landscaping, boundary treatment, external lighting, electric vehicle charging points, refuse and cycle stores and play equipment, in terms of specification, type and appearance. Furthermore, the frontage would be dominated by hard landscape, which would fail to conserve or enhance the character and appearance of the Greenway Conservation Area and would result in an excessive amount of on site car parking. The proposal would result in a poor quality development that fails to preserve and enhance the visual amenities of the locality and provide adequate facilities for prospective occupiers. The proposal would therefore conflict with Policy BE1 and HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan (November 2012) policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12, DMHB 14, DMHB4; DMT6 and DMT 2 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 (2020), Policy G4, G8 and HC1 of the London Plan (2021) and the NPPF (2021)."
