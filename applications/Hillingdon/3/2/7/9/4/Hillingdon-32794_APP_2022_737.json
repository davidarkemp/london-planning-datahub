    "The proposed two storey rear extension, by reason of its excessive size, scale, bulk and design including the large crown roof form, would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original building and would be detrimental to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the street scene. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), Policy D3 and D6 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The proposed development, by reason of the side facing views from the rear and side balcony and its proximity to the neighbouring properties at Numbers 7 and 11 Kewferry Drive, would result in a form of development which would not provide satisfactory amenities to the neighbouring properties due to the overlooking and loss of privacy that would arise. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies DMHB11 and DMHD1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan - Part Two (2020).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service. We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
