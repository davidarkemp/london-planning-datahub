  "description": "Conversion of garage to habitable use and single storey link extension",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposal is for the conversion of a primarily detached structure which, by reason of its size, scale, layout and independent access, is considered capable of independent occupation from the main dwelling and is thus tantamount to a separate dwelling in a position where such a dwelling would not be acceptable as it could result in unacceptable impact on adjoining occupiers and additional requirements for amenity space and parking. The proposal is therefore contrary to policies DMHB 11, DMHD2, DMHB 18 and DMT 6 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and Policy 3.5 of the London Plan.",
    "The link extension would result in the creation of an overly wide and incongruous addition to the main house that would unbalance the appearance of the main and the adjoining property when viewed from the street scene. The proposal would therefore be harmful to the character and appearance of the main house, the pair of semi-detached properties and the wider area, contrary to  policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then policies from the Council's Local Plan Part Two-Development Management Policies, then London Plan Policies (2016)."
