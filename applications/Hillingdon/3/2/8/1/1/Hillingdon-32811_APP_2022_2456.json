For these reasons, the proposal would conflict with Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One Strategic Policies (2012) and Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The proposed development by reason of its scale, height, width, depth, roof form and design, would result in a form of development which would not provide satisfactory amenities to the neighbouring properties due to the loss of outlook and overbearing impact upon No. 42 and No. 46 Cranbourne Road. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan - Part Two (2020)."
