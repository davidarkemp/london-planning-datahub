    "The development hereby permitted shall not be carried out except in complete accordance with the details shown on the submitted plans numbers A03 Rev. P1 and A02 Rev. P3 received on 4/10/19.",
    "REASON",
    "To ensure the development complies with the provisions of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two Saved UDP Policies (November 2012) and the London Plan (March 2016).",
    "The materials to be used in the construction of the external surfaces of the development hereby permitted shall match those used in the existing building and shall thereafter be retained as such. The rooflights on the extension shall be of a 'conservation' type.",
    "REASON",
    "To safeguard the visual amenities of the conservation area and to ensure that the proposed development does not have an adverse effect upon the appearance of the existing building in accordance with Policies BE4, BE13 and BE15 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two Saved UDP Policies (November 2012).",
    "Notwithstanding the provisions of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 2015 (as amended) (or any order revoking and re-enacting that Order with or without modification), no additional windows, doors or other openings shall be constructed in the walls or roof slopes of the development hereby approved facing Nos. 8 and 10 Brooklyn Way",
    "REASON",
    "To prevent overlooking to adjoining properties in accordance with policy BE24 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two Saved UDP Policies (November 2012).",
    "The outbuilding hereby approved shall only be used for the purpose(s) stated on the application form and approved drawings, namely as a study/office. It shall not be used at any time for purposes such as a living room, bedroom, kitchen or as a separate unit of accommodation.",
    "REASON",
    "To avoid any future undesirable fragmentation of the curtilage or the creation of a separate residential use, so as to protect the amenity of adjoining residential properties in accordance with Policies BE13 and BE19 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two Saved UDP Policies (November 2012).",
    "The outbuilding hereby approved shall not have the internal space altered to create more rooms, nor shall it have further utilities added than those that are shown on the approved drawings.",
    "REASON",
    "To avoid any future undesirable creation or facilitation of a separate residential use, and so that the use remains incidental to the use of the host dwelling, so as to protect the amenity of adjoining residential properties in accordance with Policies BE13 and BE19 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two Saved UDP Policies (November 2012).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant saved policies (referred to as policies from the Hillingdon Unitary Development Plan - Saved Policies September 2007), then London Plan Policies (2016).  On the 8th November 2012 Hillingdon's Full Council agreed the adoption of the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies. Appendix 5 of this explains which saved policies from the old Unitary Development (which was subject to a direction from Secretary of State in September 2007 agreeing that the policies were 'saved') still apply for development control decisions.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the 'Saved' UDP 2007,  Local Plan Part 1, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably."
