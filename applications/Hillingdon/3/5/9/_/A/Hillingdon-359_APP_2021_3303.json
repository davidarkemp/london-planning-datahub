    "The development hereby permitted shall be begun before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.",
    "REASON",
    "To comply with Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990.",
    "The development hereby permitted shall not be carried out except in complete accordance with the details shown on submitted plan numbers 215 - Max Config Site Plan Issue D and 265 - Max Config Elevation Issue D. Thereafter the development shall be retained/maintained in accordance with the approved plans for as long as it exists.",
    "REASON",
    "To ensure the development complies with the provisions Hillingdon Local Plan Parts 1 (November 2012) and 2 (January 2020) and the London Plan (2021).",
    "Any apparatus or structure provided in accordance with this permission shall be removed from the land, as soon as reasonably practicable after it is no longer required for electronic communications purposes, and such land, shall be restored to its condition before the development took place, or to any other condition as may be agreed in writing with the Local Planning Authority.",
    "REASON",
    "To ensure that the development is removed as soon as it is no longer required in order to protect the character and appearance of the area in accordance with Policies DMHB 11 and DMHB 21 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "The decision to GRANT planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to GRANT planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan - The Spatial Development Strategy for London consolidated with alterations since 2011 (2016) and national guidance.",
    "Given the nature of the proposed development it is possible that a crane may be required during its construction.  The applicant's attention is drawn to the requirement within the British Standard Code of Practice for the safe use of Cranes, for crane operators to consult the aerodrome before erecting a crane in close proximity to an aerodrome.  This is explained further in Advice Note 4, 'Cranes and Other Construction Issues' (available at www.aoa.org.uk/publications/safeguarding.asp)"
