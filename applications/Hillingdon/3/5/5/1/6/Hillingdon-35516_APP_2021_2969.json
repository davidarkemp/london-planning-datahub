    "The proposed development, by reason of its siting, size, scale, bulk, massing, height and design (including uncharacteristic dormers and balconies and poor landscaping including loss of significant tree) would result in a cramped, incongruous and visually obtrusive form of development. The proposal would therefore cause significant harm to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the existing street scene and the surrounding area. The proposal is contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One- Strategic Policies (2012), Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHB 14 of the Hillingdon  Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020), Policies D1, D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The proposed development, by virtue of its siting, size, scale, bulk, height, design and inclusion of balconies, would cause harm to the living conditions of neighbouring residential occupiers at numbers 30 and 34 Norwich Road and number 1 Cranbourne Road, in terms of outlook, light, privacy, overlooking, overbearing impact and sense of enclosure. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One- Strategic Policies (2012), Policy DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The proposed development would result in the net loss of an eight-bedroom dwelling (i.e. a family sized unit) and fails to provide any three or more bedroom (family sized) units. Robust justification has not been provided to demonstrate that the provision of family sized units would be unsuitable or unviable. The proposal would therefore not provide a suitable mix of housing to support sustainable, inclusive and mixed communities contrary to Policy DMH 2 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy H10 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The proposed development, by virtue of its substandard internal floorspace, poor outlook, poor levels of natural light and lack of privacy would result in substandard forms of residential accommodation to the detriment of future occupants. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies DMHB 15 and  DMHB 16 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The proposed development, by reason of its inadequate size, quality and functionality of external amenity space provision, would result in substandard forms of residential accommodation to the detriment of future occupants. The proposal therefore conflicts with Policy DMHB 18 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The proposed development, by virtue of the proposed new vehicular crossover being located within a bus stop clearway and in proximity to the junction with Norwich Road and Cranbourne Road, would have a harmful impact on the safe use of the highway and impede the free flow of traffic. In the absence of the on-site car parking spaces to the front of the site, the proposal would cause unacceptable street parking stress, which in turn, would lead to highway safety issues. The proposal therefore conflicts with Policies DMT1, DMT 2 and DMT 6 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2- Development Management Policies (2020), Policies T6 and T6.1 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The proposed development would fail to provide secure, sheltered and accessible cycle parking spaces for future occupants, therefore failing to facilitate and encourage cycling as a sustainable mode of transport contrary to Policy DMT 5 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020) and Policy T5 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "The proposed development, by virtue of the absence of any lift provision and the lack of details to show that the internal layout would comply with Building Regulation requirement M4(2) and M4(3), fails to demonstrate that adequate provision would be provided to meet the needs of people with disabilities. The proposed development therefore conflicts with Policies D5 and D7 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan (2021) and national guidance.",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal.",
    "This is a reminder that Under the terms of the Planning Act 2008 (as amended) and Community Infrastructure Levy Regulations 2010 (as amended), should an application for appeal be allowed, the proposed development would be deemed as 'chargeable development' and therefore liable to pay the London Borough of Hillingdon Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and the Mayor of London's Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This would be calculated in accordance with the London Borough of Hillingdon CIL Charging Schedule 2014 and the Mayor of London's CIL Charging Schedule 2012.",
