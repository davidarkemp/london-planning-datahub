    "The evidence that has been provided in support of the applicant's case fails to demonstrate that, on the balance of probabilities, there has been a continuous breach of Conditions 4 (operating hours)  and 5 (Preparation and sale of food) attached to planning permission 35503/D/98/1474 for a continuous period of at least ten years before 15th March 2024 (the date of the application). The use of the premises between  the 11.00am to 12.30am Sundays to Thursdays and 11.00am to 02.00am on Fridays and Saturdays is therefore unlawful.",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan (2021) and national guidance."
