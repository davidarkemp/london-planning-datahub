    "The proposal by virtue of its failure to provide adequate provision of disabled accessible parking designated to future occupants of the development is considered to result in inadequate standards of living accommodation for the occupants of the fully accessible units (M4 3). As such the proposed development fails to accord with London Plan (2021) Policies T6.1, D5, D7, The GLA \"Best Practice Guidance - Wheelchair Accessible Housing\" (September 2007) and Standard 18 of the GLA Housing SPG (March 2016) and the Accessible Hillingdon Supplementary Planning Document (2017).",
    "The proposal is considered to fail to make the maximum reasonable (in-lieu contribution) of affordable housing. As such the application fails to accord with Polices H4, H5, H6 of the London Plan (2021) Policy H2 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies (2012), Policy DMH7 of the Hillingdon Local Plan : Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), the Hillingdon Planning Obligations SPD (July 2014), the Mayor of London Affordable Housing and Viability SPG (2017), the GLA Affordable Housing SPG (Consultation Draft May 2023) and paragraph 58 of the NPPF (2021)",
    "The proposed development, in the absence of a Section 106 legal agreement, fails to provide contributions towards the improvement of services and facilities and mitigation measures as a consequence of demands created by the proposed development. The scheme therefore conflicts with Policy DMCI 7 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two Development management Policies (2020), the London Borough of Hillingdon Supplementary Planning Document on Planning Obligations, Policy DF1 of the London Plan (2021) and paras 55-58 of the NPPF (2021).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan - The Spatial Development Strategy for London consolidated with alterations since 2011 (2016) and national guidance."
