  "description": "Redevelopment of the site to include the demolition of the existing building (Use Class B1a) and the erection of a 8-storey building and a basement to provide residential units (Use Class C3) and associated works.",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed development, by reason of its overall height, scale and siting in close proximity to Fitzroy Court would result in a cramped and overbearing visual relationship between the proposed development and the existing Fitzroy Court development resulting in harm to the setting of Fitzroy Court, in particular the appreciation of the architectural composition of the south eastern facade. The proposal would be detrimental to the visual amenities of the street scene and the character and appearance of the wider area, contrary to Policies 3.4,3.5, 3.7 and 7.6 of the London Plan (2016), Policies BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020),  Policies D3 and D4 of the Intend to Publish Version of the London Plan (2019) and Paragraphs 124-132  of the National Planning Policy Framework (2019).",
    "The proposed development, due to its siting, layout, height and massing would have an unacceptably harmful impact on the residential amenities of the neighbouring properties at Fitzroy Court and Yardley Court resulting in unacceptable loss of outlook, noise concerns due to the close proximity of habitable rooms, creation of undue sense of enclosure, loss of light to habitable rooms and result in an overbearing impact. The proposal is therefore considered contrary to Policies EM8 and BE1 of the Local Plan: Part One (2012) and Policy DMHB 11 of the Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policies 3.5 and 7.15 of the London Plan (2016), Policies D3, D14 and D14 of the Intend to Publish Version of the London Plan (2019), Paragraphs 127 and 182 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2019) and The Building Research Establishment (BRE) guidelines \"Site Layout Planning for Daylight and Sunlight: A Guide to Good Practice\" (1991).",
    "The proposed development would provide a substandard level of accommodation for future residents by reason of the number of single aspect units, poor and obscured outlook and concerns that the units may fail to receive adequate levels of light.  The proposal is therefore considered contrary to Policy BE1 of the Local Plan: Part One (2012) and Policy DMHB 11 of the Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy 3.5 and 3.6 of the London Plan (2016), Policy D6 of the Intend to Publish Version of the London Plan (2019),  Paragraph 127  of the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), The Mayor's Housing SPG (2016), The Building Research Establishment (BRE) guidelines \"Site Layout Planning for Daylight and Sunlight: A Guide to Good Practice\" (1991).",
    "The basement layout of the proposed development does allow sufficient room for vehicles to safely and conveniently manoeuvre into each car parking space which could give rise to injudicious parking on-street presenting a risk to road safety, hindering the free flow of traffic and contributing to parking stress on the surrounding roads contrary to Policies DMT 1, DMT 2 and DMT 6 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two Development Management Policies (2020), Paragraphs 108-111  of the National Planning Policy Framework (2019).",
    "Insufficient information has been submitted to demonstrate that the proposal has been designed with good acoustic design. The potential impact of noise and vibrations from the adjacent railway line to the south and the access road leading to the Old Coal Depot site has not been adequately considered. The development provides a high proportion of single aspect dwellings and dwellings with their sole aspect facing towards the railway line and the access road leading to the Old Coal Depot site.  The proposal fails to adequately mitigate against the impacts from existing noise-generating activities or uses on the proposed new noise-sensitive residential development and thereby fails to provide a suitably high quality of residential amenity for future occupiers contrary to Policies EM8 and BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012); Policy DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and Policy 7.15 of the Londo",
    "The proposed development, in the absence of a Section 106 legal agreement fails to provide contributions towards the improvement of services and facilities as a consequence of demands created by the proposed development (in respect of Affordable Housing, construction training, highways works, carbon offset, public open space, air quality contributions and Project Management and Monitoring). The scheme therefore conflicts with Policy DMCI 7 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two Development management Policies (2020), the London Borough of Hillingdon Supplementary Planning Document on Planning Obligations, Policy DF1 of the London Plan Intend to Publish Version (2019), Policy 8.2 of the London Plan (2016) and paras 54-57 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2019).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan - The Spatial Development Strategy for London consolidated with alterations since 2011 (2016) and national guidance.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "In order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably. In addition further guidance was offered to the applicant by the case officer during the processing of the application to identify the amendments to address those elements of the scheme considered unacceptable which the applicant chose not to implement."
