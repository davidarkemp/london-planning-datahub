    "(It is agreed that it is likely that two of the hornbeams are younger than the TPO and as a result are not protected (PS2 and PS4 on application) and the description of works has been changed to only take into account the TPO trees). The Hornbeam (PS5 on application) and Oak (PS3 on application) along with other trees form a boundary between the rear of 26 Linksway and 7 Rogers Ruff. They have a moderate amenity value (as a group) and significantly contribute to the arboreal character of the Copse Wood Estate (Area of Special Local Character). The trees also contribute to local biodiversity and form part of the area of mature, protected trees that help to provide a gradual transition of mature tree cover between the dwellings in the Copsewood Estate and the nearby Ruislip woods National Nature Reserve (NNR).",
