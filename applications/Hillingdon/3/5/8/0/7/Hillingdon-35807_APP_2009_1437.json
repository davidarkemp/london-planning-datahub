  "description": "Change of use from A1 Retail to A2 Financial and professional services (Bookmakers) to include alterations to windows and front entrance and installation of 4 satellite dishes/aerials to rear and air conditioning units.",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposal by reason of the loss of an A1 retail unit and increase in the width of the interruption of the retail frontage, would erode the retail function and attractiveness of the shopping centre, harming its vitality and viability. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy S11 of the adopted Hillingdon Unitary Development Plan (Saved Policies September 2007) and policy 3D.3 of the London Plan 2008.",
    "The proposed shopfront alterations, by reason of their overall size, scale and design would fail to harmonise with the symmetry, composition, proportions and overall architectural character of the original building. The proposal would therefore be detrimental to the character and appearance of the surrounding area generally, contrary to policies BE13, BE19 and BE28 of the adopted Hillingdon Unitary Development Plan (Saved Policies September 2007).",
    "The proposal fails to provide adequate information (a noise assessment) to demonstrate that the proposed condenser units would not harm the residential amenities of adjoining and nearby residents, contrary to policies S6 (iii) and OE1 of the adopted Hillingdon Unitary Development Plan (Saved Policies September 2007).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Unitary Development Plan Saved Policies (September 2007) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including the London Plan (February 2008) and national guidance."
