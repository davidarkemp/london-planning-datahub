    "The proposed external materials would fail to match the existing building and would result in a harmful mix of materials on the elevations of the existing property. The resultant mix of materials would harm both the architectural integrity of the building as well as the streetscene of Copse Wood Way, failing to preserve the character and appearance of the Area of Special Local Character. The proposal would therefore conflict with Policies BE1 and HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 1, DMHB 5, DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), conflicting with the reason for attaching the original condition.",

Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020."
