    "The proposed boundary fence, by reason of height, scale, siting, design and appearance, would result in an over-dominant and disproportionate form of development that would unduly harm the residential amenity of neighbouring properties in terms of loss of sunlight/daylight, visual outlook and sense of enclosure. In addition, the proposed boundary fence, by reason of design, appearance and height, would fail to blend in with the character and appearance of the rear garden and verdant of the property and its immediate setting, and would therefore be harmful to the visual amenity of neighbouring properties and the character of the surrounding area. As such, the development is contrary to policies DMHB11 and DMHD1 of the Hillington Local Plan : Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and Policy D4 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "The proposed rear patio, by reason of size, height and siting, would result in overlooking over adjacent properties unduly harming their privacy and residential amenity. As such, the development would fail to protect the residential amenity of neighbouring residents and is therefore contrary to policies DMHB11 and DMHD1 of the Hillington Local Plan : Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and Policy D4 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
