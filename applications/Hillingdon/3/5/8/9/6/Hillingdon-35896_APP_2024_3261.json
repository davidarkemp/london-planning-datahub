    "The proposed part-raising of the rear patio, by reason of its size, height, and location, would result in inappropriate overlooking of adjacent properties, unduly harming their privacy and residential amenity, and would be overly bulky and tall. As such, the development would fail to protect the residential amenity of neighbouring residents and would harm the character of the dwelling and its immediate setting, and is therefore contrary to Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021), Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One Strategic (2012), and Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12, and Policy DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan (2021) and national guidance."
