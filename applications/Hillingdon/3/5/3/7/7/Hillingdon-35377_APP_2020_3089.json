  "description": "1-bed detached dwelling with habitable roofspace, parking and amenity space and installation of vehicular crossover to front",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed development, by reason of its siting, size, scale, layout, width and detailed design would constitute an incongruous and  cramped form of development resulting in the loss of the open aspect of this prominent corner plot which would not be in keeping with the prevailing character of residential dwellings in the area and would appear incongruous within the streetscene. The development would therefore be harmful to the character and appearance of the site, the street scene and the wider area contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two-Development Plan Policies (2020) and Policies 3.5 and 7.4 of the London Plan (2016).",
    "The proposed development, would result in the unacceptable subdivision of an existing residential garden resulting in the loss of the openness of this prominent corner plot. The development would therefore constitute an unacceptable form of garden development and is therefore unacceptable in principle.The development would therefore be contrary to Policy DMH 6 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Plan Policies (2020).",
    "The proposal fails to provide amenity space of sufficient size and quality commensurate to the size and layout of the proposed development. As such the proposal would provide a substandard form of accommodation for future residents contrary to Policies DMHB11 an DMHB18 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Plan Policies (2020).",
    "In the absence of a Tree Survey and Arboricultural Implication Assessment to BS5837: 2005 standards, the application has failed to demonstrate that the development will safeguard existing street trees adjacent to the site and further fails to demonstrate protection for long-term retention of the trees.  The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies DMHB11, DMHB12 and DMHB14 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Plan Policies (2020).",
    "Due to the proposed siting of the off street parking bays and direct pedestrian access for the existing dwelling, it is considered this would result in a large area of hardstanding/parking on this frontage, and partial loss of the hedge which would not allow sufficient space to mitigate this impact by way of soft landscaping. The proposal would therefore be detrimental to the visual amenities of the street scene and character and appearance of the wider area, contrary to Policies DMHB11, DMHB12 and DMHB14 of the Hillingdon Local plan - Part Two (2020).",
    "The proposal has not demonstrated that sufficient off street parking/manoeuvring/access arrangements would be provided, and therefore the development is considered to result in substandard car parking provision with regard to the Councils approved car parking standard, leading to possible on-street parking /queuing to the detriment of public and highway safety and contrary to Policies DMT2 and DMT6 of the Hillingdon Local Plan - Part Two (2020).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan - The Spatial Development Strategy for London consolidated with alterations since 2011 (2016) and national guidance.",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2016). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal.",
    "This is a reminder that Under the terms of the Planning Act 2008 (as amended) and Community Infrastructure Levy Regulations 2010 (as amended), should an application for appeal be allowed, the proposed development would be deemed as 'chargeable development' and therefore liable to pay the London Borough of Hillingdon Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and the Mayor of London's Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This would be calculated in accordance with the London Borough of Hillingdon CIL Charging Schedule 2014 and the Mayor of London's CIL Charging Schedule 2012.",
