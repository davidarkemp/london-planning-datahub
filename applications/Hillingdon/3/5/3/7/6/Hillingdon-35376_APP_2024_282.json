    "The proposal represents inappropriate development within the Green Belt in terms of the guidance contained in the National Planning Policy Framework which is harmful by definition to its open character and appearance. Furthermore, there are no very special circumstances provided or which are evident which either singularly or cumulatively justify the development which would overcome the presumption against inappropriate development in the Green Belt. The development is therefore harmful to the Green Belt and the visual amenities of the street scene, contrary to the Section 13 of the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF), Policy G2 of the London Plan, Policy EM2 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies and Policy DMEI 4 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The proposed development would result in harm to surrounding area with specific reference to noise including the natural environment. In the absence of a noise assessment, the proposal fail to comply with Policy DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy EM8 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies (2012), Policy D14 of the London Plan (2021) requires proposals to avoid significant adverse noise impacts on quality of life, and minimise and mitigate potential adverse noise effects and Paragraph 191 of the NPPF (2023).",
    "It has not been demonstrated that the proposed development would not cause unacceptable adverse impacts arising from dust and deteriorating air quality resulting in significant harm to the living conditions and well-being of neighbouring residents. The proposal thereby conflicts with Paragraph 191 of the NPPF (2023), Policy SI 1 of the London Plan (2021), Policies BE1 and EM8 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies (2012) and Policies DMEI 14 and DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "Insufficient information has been provided regarding the risk and effects of drainage and flooding at the site. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy DMEI 9 and DMEI 10 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020), Policies SI 12 and SI 13 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The proposed development is not supported by any appropriate risk assessment, and it has not been demonstrated that the risk to controlled waters are acceptable or can be appropriately managed. It fails to meet the requirements set out in Paragraphs 180 and 189 of the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF 2023). Furthermore, the planning application is contrary to Policy DMEI 11 (Protection of Ground Water Resource) and Policy DMEI12 (Development of Land Affected by Contamination) of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2: Development Management Policies (Adopted January 2020) and Policy SI5 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "The application is not accompanied by an appropriate Ecology Report in order to assess the impact on the surrounding biodiversity. The proposed use has the potential to disturb local wildlife and insufficient information has therefore been provided to determine the impact of the proposals on ecology. The proposals are therefore considered to be contrary to Policy EM7 (Biodiversity and Geological conservation) of the Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies (2012), Policy DMEI6, DMEI7 and Policy DMHB 14 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (January 2020) and Policy G6 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "a) We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
