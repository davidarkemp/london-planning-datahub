    "The development, by virtue of the loss of the existing family dwelling, would conflict with the Borough's strategic housing goal of safeguarding 3-bedroom family dwellings and the proposed change of use to a Large HMO would be harmful to the character of the area. Consequently, the principle of development is considered to be unacceptable. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies DMH 1 and DMH 5 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2023).",
    "In the absence of a submitted transport appraisal and travel plan demonstrating that sufficient off-street parking has been provided, as required by the local parking standard for the proposed level of occupancy, the proposal has the potential to lead to undue on-street parking displacement to the detriment of parking capacity and safety on the local public highway, contrary to Local Plan: Part 2 Development Management Plan (2020) - Policies DMT 1, DMT 2 & DMT 6 (Appendix C) and Policy T4 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate that the proposal and the high number of potential occupants, would not result in noise and general disturbance to neighbouring properties alongside a harmful over intensification of the use of the site (through additional comings and goings generated by the additional occupants), detrimental to both the occupiers and neighbouring properties and the residential amenity of the area. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies DMH 5, DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policies D3 and D13 of the London Plan (2021) and Paragraph 135f) of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023).",
    "The proposed HMO use would provide inadequate internal communal space to accommodate the proposed increase in the number of occupants, coupled with an inadequately sized kitchen. Moreover, the application fails to demonstrate that noise transfer between the communal kitchen and ground floor HMO rooms could be adequately controlled, in order to provide a suitable level of acoustic amenity for the future occupant(s) together with poor level of privacy for the front facing HMOs rooms, collectively, these issues would result in a substandard form of accommodation for future occupants, contrary to Section 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023), Policies D6 and D14 of the London Plan (2021) and Policies DMH 5, DMHB 11 and DMHB 16 of the Hillingdon Local Plan - Part 2: Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2021). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
