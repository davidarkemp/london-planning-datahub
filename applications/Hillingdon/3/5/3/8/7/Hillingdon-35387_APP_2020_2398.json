  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed two-storey extension, by virtue of its siting, size, scale, bulk and design, along with the removal of boundary trees and vegetation, would be detrimentally harmful to the character, appearance and setting of the Grade II Listed Building and the visual amenity of the street scene and wider area, contrary to Policies BE1 and HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 1, DMHB 2, DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), Policy 7.8 of the London Plan (2016) and the NPPF.",
    "The proposed two-storey extension, by virtue of its size, scale and bulk would have a detrimental impact on the visual amenity and character of the Green Belt, contrary to Policy EM2 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policy DMEI 4 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), Policy 7.16 of the London Plan (2016) and the National Planning Policy Framework.",
    "The proposal, by virtue of the proposed temporary construction-related access to the site, fails to safeguard the existing Council owned Horse Chestnut tree and poses an unacceptable risk to the health and longevity of the Horse Chestnut tree, thereby impacting on the setting of the Grade II Listed Building and the visual amenity of the street scene and the wider area, contrary to Policies DMHB 1, DMHB 2, DMHB 11, DMHB 12  and DMHB 14 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2016). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020."
