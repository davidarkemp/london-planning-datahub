  "description": "Demolition of a late C20th single story extension and erection of a replacement 2 storey extension (Listed Building Consent)",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed two-storey extension, by virtue of its siting, size, scale, bulk and design, along with the removal of boundary trees and vegetation, would be detrimentally harmful to the character, appearance and setting of the Grade II Listed Building and the visual amenity of the street scene and wider area, contrary to Policies BE1 and HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 1, DMHB 2, DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), Policy 7.8 of the London Plan (2016) and the NPPF.",
    "The proposal, by virtue of the proposed temporary construction-related access to the site, fails to safeguard the existing Council owned Horse Chestnut tree and poses an unacceptable risk to the health and longevity of the Horse Chestnut tree, thereby impacting on the setting of the Grade II Listed Building, contrary to Policies DMHB 1, DMHB 2 and DMHB 14 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "The decision to REFUSE Listed Building Consent has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE Listed Building Consent has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan - The Spatial Development Strategy for London consolidated with alterations since 2011 (2016) and national guidance."
