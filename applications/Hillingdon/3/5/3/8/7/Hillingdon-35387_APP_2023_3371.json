    "The proposed window replacements by virtue of their harm to the retained fabric and unsympathetic design (including proportions and detailing) would adversely affect the character and special architectural and historic interest of the listed building and would cause harm to the significance of the heritage asset, with no public benefit to outweigh this harm. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy 16 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2024), Policies HC1, D3, and D6 of The London Plan (2021), Policies BE1 and HE1 of Hillingdon Council's Local Plan Part 1 Strategic Policies (2012), and Policies DMHB 1, DMHB 4, DMHB 11, DMHB 12, and DMHD 1 of the London Borough of Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 Development Management Policies (2020).",
