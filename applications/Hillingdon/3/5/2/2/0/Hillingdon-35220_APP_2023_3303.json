    "Due to the combination of its oversized single storey rear extension roof, elongated rear dormer, and oversized wrap around first floor extension the proposed development would result in a property that is visually overcomplicated, overdeveloped and that fails to respect or integrate with the architectural  composition of the original dwelling. Furthermore the first floor extension would result in the closing of an important visual gap between No.44 and No.46, the loss of the space between the properties would be harmful to the areas character. The proposal would therefore be detrimental to the visual amenities of the host dwelling, streetscene and character of the surrounding area, all contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies, Policies DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policies D1 and D3 of the London Plan (2021), as well as paragraph 135 of the NPPF (2023).",
    "In the absence of a Flood Risk Assessment it has not been demonstrated that the site is safe and flood risk would be suitably mitigated contrary to Policy EM6 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policy DMEI 9 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies, Policy SI12 of the London Plan (2021) and Chapter 14 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan (2021) and national guidance."
