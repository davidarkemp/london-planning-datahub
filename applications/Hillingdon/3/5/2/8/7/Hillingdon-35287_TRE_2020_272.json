  "description": "To carry out tree surgery including a crown reduction in height by 4m and selective reduction of overextending side laterals to shape/balance One Scots Pine T63 on TPO 90",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The Scots Pine is situated within the rear garden of 16 High Elms Close. It can be seen from the road and as a result has a moderate to high amenity value. It significantly contributes to the arboreal character of the local area.",
    "The applicant has ticked Yes to question 4.1 \"condition of the tree\" however they have not provided any arboricultural evidence to show this is the case. The applicant has provided an annotated photograph showing approximately where the tree will be pruned to. The Pine currently has an attractive crown shape typical of this species and a reduction to the extent indicated in the photograph would remove this natural shaping and therefore greatly reduce its amenity value.",
    "Having regard to the reasons given for the proposed work, the work is unjustified and will have a detrimental impact on the visual amenity and arboreal character of the area.",
    "The removal of deadwood, dangerous / hanging branches and ivy:  This does not require the formal consent of the Council."
