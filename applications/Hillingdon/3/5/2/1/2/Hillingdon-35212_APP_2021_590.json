  "decision_conditions": [
    "The development hereby permitted shall be begun before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.",
    "REASON",
    "To comply with Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990.",
    "The development hereby permitted shall not be carried out except in complete accordance with the details shown on the submitted plans, numbers 1186-P-004B, 1186-P-005A; 1186-P-006B and the Noise Impact Assessment prepared by Nova Acoustics and shall thereafter be retained/maintained for as long as the development remains in existence.",
    "REASON",
    "To ensure the development complies with the provision of Hillingdon Local Plan Parts 1 (November 2012) and 2 (January 2020) and the London Plan (2021).",
    "Prior to the first use of the application site as an MOT test centre, the noise mitigation measures set out in 3.1.1 Recommendations & Mitigation of the Noise Assessment prepared by Nova Acoustics (13.11.2020), shall be implemented and thereafter retained/maintained as such for the lifetime of the development.",
    "REASON",
    "To safeguard the residential amenity of the occupiers of adjoining and nearby properties in accordance with policy DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 (2020).",
    "The premises shall not be used except between:-",
    "09:00 and 19:00 Mondays - Fridays",
    "09:00 to 19:00 Saturdays",
    "The premises shall not be used on Sundays or bank holidays.",
    "REASON",
    "To safeguard the residential amenity of the occupiers of adjoining and nearby properties in accordance with policy DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 (2020).",
    "Prior to the first use of the application site as an MOT test centre, the parking provision and railings detailed on the approved drawings shall be laid out/constructed and thereafter shall be permanently retained/maintained for the lifetime of the development.",
    "REASON",
    "In the interests of highway and pedestrian safety and to accord with Policies DMT 1, DMT 2 and DMT 6 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 (2020).",
    "The premises shall only be used as a tyre fitting centre and MOT test centre and for no other use.",
    "REASON",
    "For the avoidance of doubt, as the application has been assessed on this basis and the impact of any further changes of use would need to be considered against planning policy.",
    "Prior to the first use of the application site as an MOT test centre, an operational management plan shall be submitted to the Local Planning Authority for approval in writing. The plan shall set out the measures that will be taken to minimise noise and disturbance impacts to neighbouring residents, and shall include details of how MOT and tyre fitting appointments will be managed to minimise the number of vehicles on site at any given time.",
    "Thereafter the site/premises shall only be operated in strict accordance with the approved operational management plan.",
    "REASON",
    "To safeguard the residential amenity of the occupiers of adjoining and nearby properties in accordance with policy DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 (2020).",
    "The decision to GRANT planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to GRANT planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan (2021) and national guidance.",
    "The Equality Act 2010 seeks to protect people accessing goods, facilities and services from discrimination on the basis of a 'protected characteristic', which includes those with a disability. As part of the Act, service providers are obliged to improve access to and within the structure of their building, particularly in situations where reasonable adjustment can be incorporated with relative ease. The Act states that service providers should think ahead to take steps to address barriers that impede disabled people.",
    "The applicant is advised that any external plant which may be required for a ventilation system is likely to require separate planning permission. This planning permission does not infer that consent will necessarily be forthcoming.",
    "This permission does not authorise the display of advertisements or signs, separate consent for which may be required under the Town and Country Planning (Control of Advertisements) Regulations 1992.
