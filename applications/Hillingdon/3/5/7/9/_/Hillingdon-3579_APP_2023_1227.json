    "The site lies in a Critical Drainage Area (CDA) identified in the Surface Water Management Plan (SWMP) for Hillingdon. A CDA is the catchment area from which surface water drains and contributes to drainage problems. Therefore you should minimise the water from your site entering the sewers.",
    "-Water run off from any roof or hard paving associated with the development should be directed to a soakaway, or tank or made permeable. This includes any work to front gardens not part of the planning application, must be permeable or be collected and directed to a permeable area, or it would need an additional permission.",
    "-A water butt should be incorporated.",
    "-No drainage to support the extension should be connected to any existing surface water network, other than as an overflow.",
    "Nuisance from demolition and construction works is subject to control under The Control of Pollution Act 1974, the Clean Air Acts and other related legislation. In particular, you should ensure that the following are complied with:-",
    "A. Demolition and construction works which are audible at the site boundary shall only be carried out between the hours of 08.00 and 18.00 hours Monday to Friday and between the hours of 08.00 hours and 13.00 hours on Saturday. No works shall be carried out on Sundays, Bank or Public Holidays.",
    "B. All noise generated during such works shall be controlled in compliance with British Standard Code of Practice BS 5228:2009.",
    "C. Dust emissions shall be controlled in compliance with the Mayor of London's Best Practice Guidance' The Control of dust and emissions from construction and demolition.",
    "D. No bonfires that create dark smoke or nuisance to local residents.",
    "You are advised to consult the Council's Environmental Protection Unit (www.hillingdon.gov.uk/nois",
    "On 1 July 1997, a new act, The Party Wall etc. Act 1996, came into force.",
    "This Act requires a building owner to notify, and obtain formal agreement from, any adjoining owner, where the building owner proposes to:-",
    "1)      carry out work to an existing party wall;",
    "2)      build on the boundary with a neighbouring property;",
    "3)      in some circumstances, carry out groundworks within 6 metres of an adjoining building.",
    "Notification and agreements under this Act are the responsibility of the building owner and are quite separate from Building Regulations or planning controls. Building Control will assume that an applicant has obtained any necessary agreements with the adjoining owner, and nothing said or implied by Building Control should be taken as removing the necessity for the building owner to comply fully with the Act.",
    "The decision to GRANT planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2021). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020.",
    "You are advised that if any part of the development hereby permitted encroaches by either its roof, walls, eaves, gutters, or foundations, then a new planning application may have to be submitted. The validity of this planning permission may be challengeable by third parties if the development results in any form of encroachment onto land outside the applicant's control for which the appropriate Notice under Article 13 of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015 has not been served."
