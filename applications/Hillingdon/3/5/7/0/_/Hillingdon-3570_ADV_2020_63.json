  "description": "Installation of illuminated 48-sheet D-Poster display and vertical meadow.",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed sign and vertical meadow by reason of their overall size, scale, design, colour, and illumination would result in a cluttered appearance that would appear visually intrusive and out of keeping with signage in the locality. The proposal would be detrimental to the character and appearance of the existing and adjoining properties and the visual amenity of the street scene. As such, the proposal is contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11 and DMHB 13A of the  Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "The Council has however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reason for refusal."
