    "The proposed first floor side and rear extensions, by virtue of their excessive size, scale, bulk, depth, and flat roofed  design, would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original building and would be detrimental to the character, appearance, and visual amenities of the street scene, failing to either preserve or enhance the character or appearance of the Greenway Conservation Area. The proposal is, therefore, contrary to the  Paragraphs 205; 206, 207 and 208 of the NPPF (2023), Policies D3 and HC1 of the London Plan (2021), Policies BE1 and HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012), and Policies DMHB 1, DMHB 4, and DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The proposed first floor side and rear extensions by reason of their size, scale and siting, including the overall length of the rear projection, would be detrimental to the residential amenities of the adjoining occupiers at number 58 and 54 The Greenway, in terms of loss of daylight/sunlight, outlook and overbearing effect. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The proposed first floor side and rear extensions by reason of the side facing first floor windows serving a habitable room  and its proximity to the neighbouring properties at Numbers 54 and 52 The Greenway would result in a form of development which would not provide satisfactory amenities for that adjoining properties, due to the loss of privacy that could arise. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy DMHB 11 and DMHD1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The proposed development has failed to demonstrate that it would provide an adequate level of outlook for the future occupiers of an existing first floor rear facing bedroom due to the close  proximity of the proposed side/rear extension. The proposal would therefore give rise to a substandard form of living accommodation to the detriment of the amenities of future occupiers contrary to Policy DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies and Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
