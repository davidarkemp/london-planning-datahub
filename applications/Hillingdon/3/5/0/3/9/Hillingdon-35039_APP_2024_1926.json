    "The proposed replacement of the front bay sash windows with upvc windows and the proposed front facing window in the garage conversion would fail to respond to the architectural integrity of the host building and would fail to conserve or enhance the character and appearance of this building which lies within the Greenway Conservation Area. and there are no public benefits that would outweigh the identified less than substantial harm. The proposal would therefore be contrary Policies BE1 and HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012), Policies DMHB 1, DMHB 4, and DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two- Development Management Policies (2020), Policies HC1, D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021) and Paragraphs 205; 206; 207 and 208 of the NPPF (2023) and Section 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended).",
