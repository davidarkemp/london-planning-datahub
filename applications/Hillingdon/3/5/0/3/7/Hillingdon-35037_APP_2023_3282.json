    "The first floor bedroom windows within the new dwelling would provide views toward the rear elevation window of No.9 Cleveland Road which serves a bedroom. Due to the position of the window and its close proximity to the mentioned neighbour, the proposed development would cause excessive overlooking and a significant loss of privacy to the detriment of the neighbours amenities and living conditions. The proposal is therefore considered to be contrary to Policies DMH 6 and DMHB 11, of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021), and paragraph 135 (f) of the NPPF (2021).",
    "The proposed private amenity space for the dwelling and the retained garden space for no.9 Cleveland Road would be undersized and would not meet the external private amenity space standards. Both the current and future occupiers of the properties would therefore be subjected to a poor standard of living accommodation to the detriment of their amenities. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policy DMHB 18 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "In the absence of the submission of a section plan, it cannot be determined from the proposed drawings the internal floor to celling height of the dwelling. As such, it cannot be determined that the property would have a sufficient level of internal accommodation. As such, the proposed development is contrary to Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "The application submission fails to fully demonstrate that the proposal would not give rise to adverse impacts upon the highway network to the detriment of traffic congestion, parking stress and highway safety. Based on the information submitted, the proposed development is considered to have an unacceptable impact on highway safety.  As such, the proposal is contrary to Policies DMT 1, DMT 2, DMT 5 and DMT 6 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), as well as policies T2, T4 and T6 of the London Plan (2021) and paragraph 115 of the NPPF (2023)."
