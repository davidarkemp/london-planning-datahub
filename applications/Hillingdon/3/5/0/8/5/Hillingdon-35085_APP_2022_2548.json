    "The establishment of a large HMO for up to ten occupants is inappropriate and incompatible with the character and form of existing residential development in the local area, contrary to Policy DMH 5 of the Hillingdon Local Plan - Part 2: Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "By virtue of the increase in the number of occupants, the proposal would give rise to undue noise and general disturbance to neighbouring residents from additional comings and goings, movements between parked vehicles on the street and the building and the use of the rear garden, contrary to Policy D14 of the London Plan (2021), Policy EM8 of the Hillingdon Local Plan - Part 1: Strategic Policies (2012), Policies DMH 5 and DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan - Part 2: Development Management Policies (2020) and the National Planning Policy Framework.",
    "The proposed development would fail to provide adequate car parking and electric vehicle parking to serve the increase in the number of occupants, resulting in increased pressure upon on-street car parking, additional traffic congestion on local roads and a lack of alternative forms of sustainable transportation. This is contrary to Section 9 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021, Policies T2, T4, T5 and T6 of the London Plan (2021) and Policies DMH 5, DMT 1, DMT 2 and DMT 6 of the Hillingdon Local Plan - Part 2: Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The dwelling has inadequate internal floorspace to accommodate the proposed increase in the number of occupants, coupled with an inadequately sized kitchen and Room 5 and no identified storage. Moreover, the application fails to demonstrate that noise transfer between the communal kitchen and Room 2 could be adequately controlled, in order to provide a suitable level of acoustic amenity for the future occupant(s) of Room 2. Collectively, these issues would result in a substandard form of accommodation for future occupants, contrary to Section 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies D6 and D14 of the London Plan (2021) and Policies DMH 5, DMHB 11 and DMHB 16 of the Hillingdon Local Plan - Part 2: Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "In the absence of a Flood Risk Assessment and by virtue of an increase in the number of proposed occupants, there is inadequate information to conclude that the proposal would not result in adverse flood risk to future occupiers, contrary to Section 14 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy EM6 of the Hillingdon Local Plan - Part 1: Strategic Policies (2012), Policy DMEI 9 of the Hillingdon Local Plan - Part 2: Development Management Policies (2020), and Policy SI12 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "The proposed development, in the absence of waste and recycling storage to cater for the increased number of people living at the property, would result in the uncontrolled and unsightly storage of waste to the front of the property, to the detriment of its appearance and that of the street scene. As such the proposal is contrary to Policy DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan (Part 2) 2020.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service. We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal.",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan 2021."
