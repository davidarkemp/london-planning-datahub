    "The proposed development by reason of its design, siting, bulk and size in this open prominent corner plot location, would result in a cramped, incongruous and insubordinate form of development that would cause harm to the character and appearance of the original property and surrounding area. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012), Policies DMHD 1, DMH 6, DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021) and Chapter 12 of the  National Planning Policy Framework (2024).",
    "Due to its location, access, proposed parking arrangement and cycle storage location, the proposed development would result in an overprovision of car parking, poor level of pedestrian and cycle access and would lead to a more dangerous highway network , contrary to",
    "Policies DMT 1, DMT 2, DMT 5 and DMT 6 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), as well as policies T2, T4 and T6 of the London Plan (2021) and paragraph 116 and 117 of the NPPF (2024).",
    "The proposed development would fail to provide a sufficient level of private external amenity space and would provide the future occupiers of the ground floor front facing bedrooms with a poor level of outlook and potential light spill due to the position of the car parking spaces. As such, the development would provide future occupiers of both properties with a poor level of external and internal accommodation to the detriment of their amenities, contrary to Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021) and Policies DMHB 16 and DMHB 18 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "The proposed development in terms of its design, intensification of use, highway impact and shortfall in on site private external amenity space to serve the retained and proposed dwelling would result in an overdevelopment of the site. The applicant has failed to demonstrate significant public benefits to outweigh the harm identified. As such the proposed development is contrary to paragraph 11 of the NPPF (2024)",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan (2021) and NPPF (2024).",
    "This is a reminder that Under the terms of the Planning Act 2008 (as amended) and Community Infrastructure Levy Regulations 2010 (as amended), should an application for appeal be allowed, the proposed development would be deemed as 'chargeable development' and therefore liable to pay the London Borough of Hillingdon Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and the Mayor of London's Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This would be calculated in accordance with the London Borough of Hillingdon CIL Charging Schedule 2014 and the Mayor of London's CIL Charging Schedule 2012.",
