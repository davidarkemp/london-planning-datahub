    "Due to its irregular siting (in the rear gardens of two properties) and uncharacteristic design, the proposed dwelling would form an incongruous addition to the area. It would fail to integrate with the layout of the surrounding area, scale of other garden development and appearance of other properties on Marlborough Road. The proposal is therefore detrimental to the visual amenity and character of the surrounding area and is considered to be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies, Policies DMH 6, DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policies D1, D3 and D6 of the London Plan (2021), as well as paragraphs 71, 124 and 130 of the NPPF (2021).",
    "Due to its height, design (mainly window positioning) and close proximity to the boundaries shared with No.2, 4 and 6 Marlborough Road, as well as 1A, 1B, and 3 Pole Hill Road, the proposed dwelling would lead to a significant loss of privacy and overlooking to the gardens of the mentioned properties, discouraging use of the neighbouring gardens and creating an uncomfortable external residential environment for their occupiers. The proposal would also cause a sense of enclosure from the rear gardens of the mentioned properties and would also provide views into the rear windows of No.6 Marlborough Road, causing harm to the privacy of its occupiers. The proposal is therefore considered to be contrary to Policy DMHB 11 of the Local Plan and 130 (f) of the NPPF (2021).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan (2021) and national guidance."
