    "By reason of its irregular siting (in the rear gardens of two properties), uncharacteristic design, excessive height and bulk, the proposed dwelling would form an oversized and incongruous addition to the area. It would fail to integrate with the layout of the surrounding area, scale of other garden development and appearance of other properties on Marlborough Road. Due to the mentioned features, as well as the fact that the proposal would provide inadequate amenity space for occupiers of No.2 Marlborough Road and uncharacteristically small gardens for all 3 properties, the proposal is considered to be an overdevelopment of the site. The proposal is therefore detrimental to the visual amenity and character of the surrounding area and is considered to be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies, Policies DMH 6, DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policies D1, D3 and D6 of the Londo",
    "No.2 Marlborough Road would provide 85sqm of private amenity space for existing/future occupants of the 4 bedroom dwelling, it would therefore fail to comply with Policy DMHB 18 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and is considered to provide a substandard level of private amenity space for future occupants of the property.",
    "The proposed development, by virtue of the site layout, access arrangements, internal design of the building, and absence of details to show that the internal layout would comply with Building Regulation requirement M4(2), fails to demonstrate that adequate provision would be provided to meet the needs of people with disabilities. The proposed development therefore conflicts with Policies D5 and D7 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The proposed development by virtue of its size, scale, bulk, height and proximity, would be detrimental to the amenities of the adjoining occupiers at Nos.2 and 4 Marlborough Road, 1A, 1B, and 3 Pole Hill Road, by reason of overdominance, visual intrusion and loss of outlook. Furthermore due to the 9.5m separation distance between the first floor rear windows of the property and rear garden of No.6 Marlborough Road, the proposed development is likely to lead to direct overlooking and a loss of privacy to that neighbour, subsequently harming their amenities. It is therefore considered that the proposal would be contrary to Policy DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies.",
    "The proposed refuse storage area would be sited approximately 35m from Marlbourough Road. It would therefore be located outside of the Council's maximum 'waste collection' distance standard of 10m and is considered to be in an unsuitable an inaccessible location, contrary to Policy DMHB 11 (D) of the Local Plan Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan - The Spatial Development Strategy for London consolidated with alterations since 2011 (2016) and national guidance."
