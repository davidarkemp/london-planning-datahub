  "description": "Two storey, 5-bed detached dwelling with habitable roofspace, parking and amenity space involving demolition of existing dwelling",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed development, by reason of its size, scale, bulk, height and design, would result in a poor and incongruous form of development that would be detrimental to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding North Uxbridge Area of Special Local Character. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies BE1 and HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 1, DMHB 5, DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), Policy 7.8 of the London Plan (2016) and the NPPF.",
    "The proposed single storey rear element, by reason of its size, scale bulk, excessive height and depth, would be detrimental to the amenities of the adjoining occupiers at 15 and 19 Fairfield Road, by reason of overdominance, overshadowing, visual intrusion, loss of light and loss of outlook. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policy DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two -Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan - The Spatial Development Strategy for London consolidated with alterations since 2011 (2016) and national guidance."
