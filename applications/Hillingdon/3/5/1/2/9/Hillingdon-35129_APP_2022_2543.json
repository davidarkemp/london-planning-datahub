    "The proposed dwelling would disrupt and unbalance the visual symmetry which exists between No.2 and No.4 Worcester Road, it would therefore cause harm to the appearance of those properties.  Furthermore the south side of Worcester Road is strongly defined by pairs of semi detached dwellings. The proposal would result in a block of terraced properties which would be out of keeping with the established character of the area. The proposed dwelling would therefore be detrimental to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the dwelling and street scene. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), as well as policies D3 and D6 of the London Plan and  paragraphs 130 (a) and (c) of the NPPF (2021).",
    "The proposed development includes no step free access, nor entrance level WC/bathroom. The applicant has failed to demonstrate that such facilities could be provided om site without comprising the sites parking facilities or the standard of internal living accommodation within the property. The proposed development would therefore be of poor design and it would add an inaccessible home to the borough's housing stock, harming the amenities of its future occupier's contrary to Policy D7 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "This is a reminder that Under the terms of the Planning Act 2008 (as amended) and Community Infrastructure Levy Regulations 2010 (as amended), should an application for appeal be allowed, the proposed development would be deemed as 'chargeable development' and therefore liable to pay the London Borough of Hillingdon Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and the Mayor of London's Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This would be calculated in accordance with the London Borough of Hillingdon CIL Charging Schedule 2014 and the Mayor of London's CIL Charging Schedule 2012.",
