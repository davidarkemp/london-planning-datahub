    "The proposed part single storey, part two storey side and rear extension, by reason of its bulk, width and design would fail to form a subordinate addition to the host dwelling which harmonises with its original size and architectural composition. The extension would also disrupt and unbalance the visual symmetry which exists with the neighbouring semi detached dwelling, such symmetry between pairs of semi detached dwellings characterises the area. The proposed extension would therefore be detrimental to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the dwelling and street scene. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), as well as policies D3 and D6 of the London Plan and  paragraphs 130 (a) and (c) of the NPPF (2021).",
    "The proposed development fails to provide an on site safe, direct and inclusive access (which is linked to the wider highways network) for the existing/future occupiers of No.2 Worcester Road. The proposal is therefore considered to be of a poor design, which would also cause inconvenience for occupiers of the No.2, whilst creating a residential environment which is disconnected from the main road via foot. In the absence of a footpath (or similar access) the proposed development is considered to be contrary to Policy DMT 5 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "Due to the proposed parking layout and excessive width of the proposed vehicle crossover, there would be no crossover island for pedestrians trying to pass the development site. The lack of a crossover island would endanger pedestrians trying to pass the site, as there would be no place for them to safely stop when vehicles are entering or exiting the site. It would also create a more hazardous environment for vehicle users of the site, as the lack of a crossover island could encourage pedestrians to run across the site. The proposal is therefore considered to result in a more dangerous and hazardous environment for pedestrians and vehicle users of the site. The proposed development is therefore considered to be contrary to Policies DMT 2 and DMT 6 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), as well as policy T4 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "The proposed development fails to provide 60sqm of good quality, useable, outdoor private amenity space for the future occupiers of the new dwelling. The proposal would therefore create a substandard living environment for future residents, to the detriment of their amenities and as such it  is considered to be contrary to Policy DMHB 18 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan 92021) and NPPF (2021).",
    "This is a reminder that Under the terms of the Planning Act 2008 (as amended) and Community Infrastructure Levy Regulations 2010 (as amended), should an application for appeal be allowed, the proposed development would be deemed as 'chargeable development' and therefore liable to pay the London Borough of Hillingdon Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and the Mayor of London's Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This would be calculated in accordance with the London Borough of Hillingdon CIL Charging Schedule 2014 and the Mayor of London's CIL Charging Schedule 2012.",
