    "The proposed part single storey, part two storey side and rear extension, by reason of its bulk, width and design would fail to form a subordinate addition to the host dwelling which harmonises with its original size and architectural composition. The extension would also disrupt and unbalance the visual symmetry which exists with the neighbouring semi detached dwelling, such symmetry between pairs of semi detached dwellings characterises the area. The proposed extension would therefore be detrimental to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the dwelling and street scene. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), as well as policies D3 and D6 of the London Plan and  paragraphs 130 (a) and (c) of the NPPF (2021).",
    "Due to the proposed parking layout and excessive width of the proposed vehicle crossover, there would be no crossover island for pedestrians trying to pass the development site. The lack of a crossover island would endanger pedestrians trying to pass the site, as there would be no place for them to safely stop when vehicles are entering or exiting the site. It would also create a more hazardous environment for vehicle users of the site, as the lack of a crossover island could encourage pedestrians to run across the site. The proposal is therefore considered to result in a more dangerous and hazardous environment for pedestrians and vehicle users of the site. Furthermore there is no justification for the proposed increased level of parking on site. The proposed development is therefore considered to be contrary to Policies DMT 2 and DMT 6 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), as well as policy T4 of the London Plan (2021)."
