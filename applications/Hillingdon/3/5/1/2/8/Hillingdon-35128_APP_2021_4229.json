    "The proposed extensions and alterations by virtue of their cumulative size, scale, bulk and design, would fail to respect the design of the original house and fail to appear subordinate to the original dwelling, to the detriment of the character, appearance and visual amenity of the street scene, failing to preserve or enhance the wider Copse Wood Estate Area of Special Local Character. Therefore the proposal is contrary to Policies BE1 and HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 (2012), Policies DMHB 1, DMHB 5, DMHB 6, DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), Policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
