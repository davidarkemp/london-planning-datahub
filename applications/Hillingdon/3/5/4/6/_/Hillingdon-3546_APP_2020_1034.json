The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies BE1 and HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 1, DMHB 4, DMHB 11 and DMHD 2 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), Policy 7.8 of the London Plan (2016) and the NPPF.",
    "In the absence of a Tree Survey and Arboricultural Implication Assessment the proposal has failed to demonstrate that the development will safeguard existing protected trees on and adjoining the site and further fails to demonstrate protection for and long-term retention of those trees. The proposal is therefore detrimental to the visual amenity of the street scene and the Ruislip Village Conservation Area contrary to Policies BE1 and HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 1, DMHB 4, DMHB 11, DMHB 14 and DMHD 2 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",

Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020."
