    "The proposed development does not constitute permitted development by virtue of the provisions of Schedule 2, Part 3, Class M of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 2015 (as amended), the proposal has not demonstrated that sufficient off street parking/manoeuvring/access arrangements would be provided, and therefore the development is considered to result in substandard car parking provision to the Council's approved car parking standard, leading to on-street parking/queuing to the detriment of public and highway safety. The parking arrangement would result in a development where access into the building would be limited/blocked by way of the parking spaces."
