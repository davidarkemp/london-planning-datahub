    "By virtue of its siting, size, scale, bulk, massing, height, design and external finish, the proposed side extension, together with the roof extension, would result in a dominant, incongruous and visually obtrusive form of development. The proposal would therefore cause significant harm to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the host building and the surrounding area, contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One- Strategic Policies (2012), Policies DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two- Development Management Policies (2020), Policies D1, D3 and D4 of the London Plan and the National Planning Policy Framework (2024).",
    "The proposal would provide an indoor living area of an unsatisfactory quality for the future occupiers of the existing flats and would therefore give rise to a substandard form of living accommodation to the detriment of the amenity of future occupiers. The proposal is thus contrary to Policies DMHB11 and DMHB16 of the Hillingdon Local Plan - Part Two (2020) and Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "Inaccuracies and contradictions on or between plans relating to the red line boundary. Therefore it was not possible to undertake a full assessment of the application. Officers have based the information on the description of development.",
    "Therefore contrary to Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One- Strategic Policies (2012), Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two- Development Management Policies (2020), The London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2024).",
    "The development is proposed to be used in connection with five flats within the building at No.81 Bedwell Gardens which does not benefit from planning permission or a certificate of lawful development being granted to establish their lawful uses as flats. The development would therefore conflict with the requirements of Paragraph 57 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2024).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan - The Spatial Development Strategy for London consolidated with alterations since 2011 (2016) and national guidance.",
    "This is a reminder that Under the terms of the Planning Act 2008 (as amended) and Community Infrastructure Levy Regulations 2010 (as amended), should an application for appeal be allowed, the proposed development would be deemed as 'chargeable development' and therefore liable to pay the London Borough of Hillingdon Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and the Mayor of London's Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This would be calculated in accordance with the London Borough of Hillingdon CIL Charging Schedule 2014 and the Mayor of London's CIL Charging Schedule 2012.
