    "The oak tree is situated within the rear garden. It has not been reduced before and therefore has an attractive natural canopy. The oak has a moderate to high amenity value and significantly contributes to the arboreal character of the local area. It has the potential for a long life.",
    "The applicant has ticked yes to the tree having caused property damage however they have provided no information about what damage the property has and no level or crack monitoring to prove that any damage has been caused by the tree. Furthermore a reduction of three metres will significantly reduce the canopy creating multiple wounds with a higher likelihood of decay forming.",
    "Having regard to the reasons given for the proposed work, the work is unjustified and will have a detrimental impact on the visual amenity and arboreal character of the area.",
    "The removal of deadwood, dangerous / hanging branches and ivy:  This does not require the formal consent of the Council."
