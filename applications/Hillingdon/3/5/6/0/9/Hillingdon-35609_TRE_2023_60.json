    "The oak tree is situated within the rear garden. It has not been reduced before and therefore has an attractive natural canopy. The oak has a moderate to high amenity value and significantly contributes to the arboreal character of the local area. It has the potential for a long life.",
    "The applicant applied to complete the same work in February 2023 this was refused due to them not providing any technical evidence and the work would likely impact the health and amenity of the tree.",
    "They have reapplied and this time supplied historic subsidence information in relation to damage occurring in 2005 and 2018.",
    "There are two historic applications to carry out reduction works to the Oak in question in 2006 both were refused. From information within the document dated 04/02/2019 \"engineering appraisal report\" in 2006 it was concluded that reduction works would not be successful in relation to the subsidence and tree removal had too much heave potential, as a result the property was underpinned.",
