    "The  proposed part two storey, part single storey rear extension by reason of its excessive size, scale and bulk and incongruous and unsympathetic roof design would represent an unduly intrusive and incongruous form of development which would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original  dwelling and would be detrimental to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area. Therefore, the proposed development would be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan (November 2012), Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan - Part Two (2020) and Policies D3 and D6 of the London Plan (2021).",
