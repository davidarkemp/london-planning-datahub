    "The rendering of the elevations of the building creates a dwelling with an incongruous appearance out of place with the predominant brick finish of dwellings within the area within a prominent position in the North Uxbridge Area of Special Local Character. The new window to the front elevation is also inappropriate in terms of proportions, appearance and detailing and fails to respect the architectural integrity of the original dwelling and result in an incongruous addition to this building. The proposal is therefore contrary to Section 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021, policies BE1 and HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan (November 2012)  and policies DMHB5, DMHB11, DMHB12 and DMHD1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan - Part Two (2020).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service. Because of its retrospective nature, we have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
