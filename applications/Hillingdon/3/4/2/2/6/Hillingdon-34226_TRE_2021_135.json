    "The Silver Birch is situated within the rear garden of 15 Kings Road, it can be partly seen from the highway between the properties and many other properties within Kings Road and Elthorne Road have a view of the Birch from their gardens. As a result, the Silver Birch has a Moderate amenity value. It significantly contributes to the arboreal character and amenity of The Greenway Conservation Area.",
    "The applicant's reasons behind why the work is required is \"General Maintenance\" however no previous tree work applications have been approved and no arboricultural evidence has been provided as to why it requires this maintenance. A reduction and thin would unnecessarily introduce multiple wounds into it's crown, which would likely cause stress and lead to infection, affecting the birch's long-term health; this would affect the safe useful life expectancy of the tree. Pruning would also result in weakly attached re-growth forming that would be prone to future failure.",
