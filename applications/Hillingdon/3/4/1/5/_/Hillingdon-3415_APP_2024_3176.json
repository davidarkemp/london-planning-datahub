    "The proposal, by reason of the loss of the boundary treatment to the frontage, the majority of the soft landscaped front area, and the grass verge would be detrimental to the visual amenity and character of the area. The proposal is, therefore, contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One Strategic (2012) and Policies DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The proposal, by reason of vehicles reversing onto Victoria Road and the increase in the number of potential conflict points along the road, would result in the disruption of the free flow of traffic and would be detrimental to highway and pedestrian safety contrary to Policy T4 of the London Plan (2021) and Policies DMT 1 and DMT 2 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2: Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan - The Spatial Development Strategy for London consolidated with alterations since 2011 (2016) and national guidance."
