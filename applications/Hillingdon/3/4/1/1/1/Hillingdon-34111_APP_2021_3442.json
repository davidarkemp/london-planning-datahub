    "The proposed extensions, by virtue of its siting, combined height, width and in particular depth, bulk and massing, would result in a boxy, bulky, visually intrusive, disproportionate, incongruous, dominant and overbearing addition that would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original dwelling, relationship with the uniform semi-detached pairs (No.63, 65, 67 and 69 Chester Road) of which it forms a part to and character and appearance of the Northwood Area of Special Local Character. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policies D1 and D4 of the London Plan (2021), Policies BE1 and BE5 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012) and Policies DM HB5, DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The proposed extensions, by virtue of its siting, combined height, width and in particular depth, bulk and massing including placement of windows/doors would give rise to unacceptable loss of outlook, overbearing impact, visual intrusion, sense of enclosure and loss of daylight/sunlight to the occupiers at at No.65 Chester Road. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policy D4 of the London Plan (2021), Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012) and Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2021). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020."
