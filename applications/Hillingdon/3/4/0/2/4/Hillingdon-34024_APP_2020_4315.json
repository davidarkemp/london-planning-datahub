    "The proposal would result in a crossover of excessive width and would make inadequate provision for pedestrian refuge and would therefore be prejudicial to pedestrian and highway safety. As a result it would be contrary to Policy DMT 2 of the Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
