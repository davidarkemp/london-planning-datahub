  "description": "To carry out tree surgery including, a crown reduction by 3m from height, 2m from sides and back from house to provide 3m clearance to One Sycamore (T1 on application), crown reduction by 4m from height and 1.5-2m from sides to Three Limes (T2, T3 and T4 on application) all within Group 4 on TPO 88",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "Refused - To carry out tree surgery including, a crown reduction by 4m from height and 1.5-2m from sides to Three Limes (T2, T3 and T4 on application) all within Group 4 on TPO 88",
    "Approved - To carry out tree surgery including, a crown reduction by 3m from height, 2m from sides and back from house to provide 3m clearance to One Sycamore (T1 on application) within Group 4 on TPO 88",
    "All four trees are situated within the front garden. The Sycamore has a moderate to high amenity value where as the Limes have a collective High amenity value as a group with seven other limes in neighbouring properties. These create an attractive line of 10 mature Limes and I would suggest the nicest tree feature within The Avenue, Northwood. All four trees significantly contribute to the arboreal character of the local area.",
    "With regard to the proposed reductions of the Lime trees. Currently they form a linier feature with seven other Limes within the neighbouring properties. A reduction in height by 4m and 1.5-2m from the sides to only three of the group would be harmful to the appearance of the line of Lime trees as a whole and therefore, the amenity of the area. The removal of the basal growth and lifting of branches over the footpath to 2.4m are exempt from the application process.",
    "Conclusion: Having regard to the reasons given for the proposed reduction of the Limes the works w",
    "The Sycamore tree to be pruned shall be crown reduced as per the approved specification. This work shall comprise a reduction in both height and spread over the whole crown by shortening or removing peripheral branches in a uniform and systematic manner.  Where branches are shortened, they should be cut back to a suitably positioned secondary branch.",
    "Crown reduction shall not be construed as 'lopping' or 'topping' and shall result in a tree of typical form for the species and of balanced appearance. The works shall be carried out in accordance with the recommendations contained in BS 3998:2010 'Tree work - Recommendations'. Climbing irons or 'spikes' shall not be used during the execution of the work.",
    "REASON",
    "In order to protect health of the tree and the visual amenity of the area.",
    "The removal of deadwood, dangerous / hanging branches and ivy:  This does not require the formal consent of the Council.",
    "Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981:  Note that it is an offence under this act to disturb roosting bats, nesting birds or any other protected species.  Therefore, if applicable, it is advisable to consult your tree surgeon / consultant to agree an acceptable time for carrying out the approved works.",
    "Statutory crown lifting of trees: This does not require formal consent of the Council if the clearance only involves the removal of branches to give a separation between the footway and the tips of the lowest branches by up to 2.3m or the carriageway by up to 5.2m.",
    "Expected standard of tree work: The approved works must be carried out in accordance with the conditions laid out above. If they are not, then enforcement action could being taken which could lead to prosecution and heavy fines. Therefore, it is highly recommended that the works are only carried out by a professional and competent arboriculturist who undertakes to comply with the conditions of this consent and in accordance with industry best practice (BS 3998:2010). The Arboricultural Association can provide details of its approved contractors, who have demonstrated such professionalism and competence, on their website (www.trees.org.uk) or by calling 01242 522152. Or on request the Council can provide a list of contractors who are known to carry out tree work to a good standard and to normally maintain an appropriate policy of indemnity insurance."
