    "The removal of deadwood, dangerous / hanging branches and ivy:  This does not require the formal consent of the Council.",
    "The sycamore tree is located along The Avenue, Northwood and appears in good health. The tree has a moderate to high amenity value on the grounds that it is a mature tree in a prominent position along The Avenue, and is part of a row of other mature trees. These trees can be viewed by the public and from nearby properties along The Avenue and Chelwood Close.",
    "The application is requesting for a reduction of 3.5m from the East and South sides due to the proximity of nearby buildings. It is in our opinion that a 3.5m reduction in excessive and will leave the tree with an unbalanced appearance and negatively effect the amenity value.",
    "In regards to the above statements, this application is refused on the grounds that the amenity value of the tree will be reduced under this proposal.",
    "We would be more sympathetic to a lesser, balanced reduction, you may wish to discuss this with an Arboricultural Consultant and re-apply."
