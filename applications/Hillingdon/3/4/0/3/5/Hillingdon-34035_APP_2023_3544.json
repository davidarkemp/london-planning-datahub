    "The development, by reason of its depth, size, bulk, design, crown roof, massing, materials, bin store location, balconies and roof terrace, would be harmful to the character and appearance of the area and the visual amenities of the street scene which is located on the edge of the Dene Road Area of Special Local Character. The development therefore conflicts with Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012), Policies DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021) and Paragraph 135(b) and (c) of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023).",
    "The development, by reason of the siting and close proximity of the rear terrace and balconies to neighbouring properties would result in visual intrusion and an unacceptable real and perceived loss of privacy and overlooking of neighbouring occupiers. The development therefore conflicts with Policy DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021) and Paragraph 135(f) of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023).",
    "The development, by virtue of its failure to provide an adequate provision of private external amenity space, outlook and daylight/sunlight would have a harmful effect on the living conditions of the future occupants. The development therefore conflicts with Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 16 and DMHB 18 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policies D3 and D6 of the London Plan (2021) and Paragraph 135(f) of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2021). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal.",
    "This is a reminder that Under the terms of the Planning Act 2008 (as amended) and Community Infrastructure Levy Regulations 2010 (as amended), should an application for appeal be allowed, the proposed development would be deemed as 'chargeable development' and therefore liable to pay the London Borough of Hillingdon Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and the Mayor of London's Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This would be calculated in accordance with the London Borough of Hillingdon CIL Charging Schedule 2014 and the Mayor of London's CIL Charging Schedule 2012.
