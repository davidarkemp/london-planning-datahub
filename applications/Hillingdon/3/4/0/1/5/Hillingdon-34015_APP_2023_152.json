    "The proposed two storey side extension, by reason of its siting, size, scale, bulk, staggered siting with adjacent Number 94 Attlee Road and proximity to the side boundary, would result in the loss of an important gap, characteristic to the area and the loss of the sense of spaciousness between the application dwelling and the side boundary. This would give rise to a cramped form of development on the site. The proposal would therefore represent an overdevelopment of the site, would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original dwelling and would be detrimental to the visual amenities of the street scene and the character and appearance of the wider Barnhill Estate Area of Special Local Character. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies DMHB 1,DMHB 5, DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The proposed two storey side extension, and part single and part two storey rear extension, by virtue of its height, scale, mass, depth and siting on the boundary would have an unacceptable impact on the occupiers of the adjacent property at No. 94 Attlee Road and would result in an unacceptable overbearing impact, visual intrusion, and loss of outlook and natural light. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020)."
