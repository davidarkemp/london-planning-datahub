  "site_name": "126 STATION ROAD",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed development would give rise to an unacceptable adverse impact on the amenity of neighbouring residential properties, particularly in relation to noise nuisance. In the absence of a Noise Impact Assessment, given the close proximity of the site to established residential dwellings, the anticipated increase in noise levels arising from operational activities, vehicle traffic, deliveries and intensification of the day centre use within the main building, it is likely to result in a significant and harmful intrusion into the enjoyment of those properties. The proposal therefore fails to comply with Policy DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and the National Planning Policy Framework.",
    "In the absence of a Transport Statement the applicant has failed to demonstrate that the removal of the condition to permit an extension of the use of the day centre activities to a broader range of activities (outside of ancillary storage) would not result in an increase in staff numbers and patrons thus creating additional parking demand which cannot be absorbed within the site boundary. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy DMT 6 of the Local Plan : Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020)."
