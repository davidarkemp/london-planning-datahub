    "The signs by reason of their size, materials, design and means of illumination, are detrimental to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the street scene and fail to either preserve or enhance the character or appearance of the surrounding Old Uxbridge/Windsor Street Conservation Area. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies BE1 and HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies BE4, BE13, BE27 and BE29 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Saved UDP Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 1, DMHB 4 and DMHB 13A of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies with Modifications (March 2019), the adopted Supplementary Planning Document HDAS: Shopfronts, Policy 7.8 of the London Plan (2016), the adopted Supplementary Planning Document HDAS: Residential Extensions and the NPPF.",

    "The decision to REFUSE advertisement consent has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Unitary Development Plan Saved Policies (September 2007) as incorporated into the Hillingdon Local Plan (2012) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan - The Spatial Development Strategy for London consolidated with alterations since 2011 (2016) and national guidance.",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant saved policies (referred to as policies from the Hillingdon Unitary Development Plan - Saved Policies September 2007), then London Plan Policies (2016).  On the 8th November 2012 Hillingdon's Full Council agreed the adoption of the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies. Appendix 5 of this explains which saved policies from the old Unitary Development (which was subject to a direction from Secretary of State in September 2007 agreeing that the policies were 'saved') still apply for development control decisions."
