    "The proposed development by reason of its bulk, size, massing, design and crown roof would fail to read as subordinate to the host dwelling or respect its architectural integrity, appearing as an incongruous and visually dominant addition to the streetscene, failing to respond to the establish context and the wider character and appearance of the area, all contrary to Policies DMHB11 and DMHD1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two (2020).",
    "The proposed development, by virtue of its size, scale, bulk, height and proximity, would be detrimental to the amenities of the neighbouring occupiers at number 31 Cedars Drive, by reason of overdominance, overshadowing and sense of enclosure. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020)."
