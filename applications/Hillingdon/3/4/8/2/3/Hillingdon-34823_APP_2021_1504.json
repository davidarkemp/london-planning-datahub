    "The proposed part two storey, part single storey side/rear extension, in combination with the existing roof extensions, by reason of its siting in this open prominent position, size, scale, bulk and design, including its roof design, would fail to appear as a subordinate addition, which would be detrimental to the appearance of the original house, would exacerbate the asymmetry of the pair of semi-detached houses of which it forms a part and would be detrimental to the visual amenities of the street scene and the character and appearance of the wider area. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020) and policy D4 of the London Plan (2021).",
