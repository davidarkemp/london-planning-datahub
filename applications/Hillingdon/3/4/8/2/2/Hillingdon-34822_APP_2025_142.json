    "The proposed scheme by reason of overall design, positioning, scale, bulk and massing would result in an incongruous and visually intrusive form of development that could not be considered to constitute subordinate additions to the existing dwellinghouse and the works would fail to respect the architectural composition of the existing dwellinghouse. The proposed development would also fail to harmonise with the established built environment along Cornwall Road resulting in a detrimental impact on the character and appearance of the street scene. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012), Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two- Development Management Policies (2020) Policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021), and Chapter 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2024).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the Local Plan Part 1, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service."
