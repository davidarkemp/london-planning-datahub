    "The Pine and Oak in group G15 are conspicuous trees in the local landscape and contribute to the wooded character of the Hillingdon Court Park Area of Special Local Character.  The trees have a high (collective) amenity value.",
    "The applicant mentions they have consulted an Arborist in 2019 to ensure the proposed works will have no effect on the tree's health, however no report from said Arboriculturist has been provided. Tree sap and pinecones form part of a trees natural cycle, and are not seen as a valid arboricultural reason to carry out tree work. The applicant may wish to look for other solutions to this nuisance. It is agreed that the Oak has several low branches over the highway these can be lifted as part of the statutory duty (see informative). A full reduction of the Oak is not deemed necessary to ensure there are no obstructions to the highway, a reduction would unnecessarily introduce multiple wounds into the Oaks crown, which would likely cause stress and lead to infection,",
    "Statutory crown lifting of trees: This does not require formal consent of the Council if the clearance only involves the removal of branches to give a separation between the footway and the tips of the lowest branches by up to 2.3m or the carriageway by up to 5.2m.",
    "The removal of deadwood, dangerous / hanging branches and ivy:  This does not require the formal consent of the Council.",
    "Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981:  Note that it is an offence under this act to disturb roosting bats, nesting birds or any other protected species.  Therefore, if applicable, it is advisable to consult your tree surgeon / consultant to agree an acceptable time for carrying out the approved works."
