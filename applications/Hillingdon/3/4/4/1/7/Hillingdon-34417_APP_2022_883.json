  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed single storey rear extension, by reason of its cumulative size, bulk and proximity, would result in an overly dominant and overbearing feature that overshadows the adjoining property at No.128 Ashford Avenue and as such would result in a visually intrusive and an un-neighbourly form of development, resulting in a loss of light and outlook and a material loss of residential amenity. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan - Part Two (2020).",
    "The proposed development has failed to demonstrate that it would provide an adequate level of light and outlook for the future occupiers of the property in relation to the living/dining room which would not be served by a window.  The proposal would therefore give rise to a substandard form of living accommodation to the detriment of the amenities of future occupiers contrary to Policy DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies and Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service."
