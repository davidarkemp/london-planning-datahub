  "description": "To carry out tree surgery including a height reduction by 4m and sides by 1.5m to One Hornbeam (T1 on application) and a crown reduction by 4m to One Hornbeam (T2 on application) both within Area 1 on TPO 399",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The hornbeams are situated within the rear garden and collectively alongside other trees within the garden have a moderate amenity value. They significantly contribute to the arboricultural character of the Copse Wood Estate an Area of Special Local Character (ASLC) and provide a gradual transition of mature tree cover between the dwellings in the Copse Wood estate and the nearby Ruislip woods National Nature Reserve (NNR). The benefit in amenity and biodiversity afforded by the trees is both present and future because they have the potential for long life expectancies.",
    "Pruning by as much as 4m would greatly reduce the size of these hornbeams and their visual amenity.  It would unnecessarily introduce multiple wounds into its crown, which would likely cause stress and lead to infection, affecting their long-term health; this would affect the safe useful life expectancy of the trees. Pruning would also result in weakly attached re-growth forming that would be prone to future failure.",
    "The removal of deadwood, dangerous / hanging branches and ivy:  This does not require the formal consent of the Council.",
    "Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981:  Note that it is an offence under this act to disturb roosting bats, nesting birds or any other protected species.  Therefore, if applicable, it is advisable to consult your tree surgeon / consultant to agree an acceptable time for carrying out the approved works."
