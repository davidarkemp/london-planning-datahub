  "description": "To carry out tree surgery including to reduce lateral growth over patio by up to 2 m to balance crown One Hornbeam (T1 on application), To fell Two twin stemmed Hornbeam (T2 and T3 on application), To remove two smaller stems growing towards the house One Multistem Hornbeam (T4 on application), To fell one Hornbeam (T5 on application), all within Area 1 on TPO 400",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The Hornbeams are situated within the rear garden of 6 The Covert. They have attractive, natural-looking crowns typical of their species. The trees significantly contribute to local biodiversity and significantly contribute to the amenity and arboreal character of the Copse wood Estate (Area of Special Local Character). The benefit in amenity and biodiversity afforded by the trees is both present and future because they have the potential for a long life expectancy. Collectively, the trees have a high amenity value.",
    "The group of Hornbeams form a significant landscape feature behind the house. The proposed pruning and removal would reduce the size and amenity value of the group of trees and would leave gaps within the cluster. There are more than five hornbeams within the rear garden and the map provided could lead to ambiguity in relation to which trees are to be removed.",
    "Having regard to the reasons given for the proposed work, the work is unjustified and will have a detrimental impac",
    "The removal of deadwood, dangerous / hanging branches and ivy:  This does not require the formal consent of the Council."
