The remaining trees within the application are situated within the rear garden and as a result have a moderate to high group amenity value and significantly contribute to the arboreal character of the Copse Wood Estate (Area of Special Local Character). The trees also contribute to local biodiversity and form part of the area of mature, protected trees that help to provide a gradual transition of mature tree cover between the dwellings in the Copsewood Estate and the nearby Ruislip woods National Nature Reserve (NNR). The benefit in amenity and biodiversity afforded by these trees is both present and future because apart from one hornbeam (T4 on application) they have the potential for a long life expectancy.",
