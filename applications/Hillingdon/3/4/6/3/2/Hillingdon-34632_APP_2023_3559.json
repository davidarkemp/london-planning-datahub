    "The development would result in a harmful loss of garden land and the principle of intensifying the residential use involving the loss of existing private garden areas is considered to be unacceptable. The development is therefore contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012), Policies DMH 6 and DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2023).",
    "The development, by reason of its siting, design and layout, would fail to harmonise with the prevailing development pattern of the street scene and would appear as an incongruous addition, resulting in harm to the character and appearance of the area. The development is therefore contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012), Policies DMH 6, DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2023).",
    "The development, by virtue of the proximity to the bin/cycle store, would not maintain an adequate outlook and source of natural light for the bedroom, resulting in substandard living conditions for future occupiers. The development is therefore contrary to the Housing quality and standards of Policies D3 and D6 of London Plan (2021), Policies DMHB 11 and DMHB 16 of Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and Paragraph 135f) of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023).",
    "The development would fail to provide safe, acceptable and accessible parking which would increase parking stress in a controlled zone; would prejudice highway safety; and would fail to encourage sustainable modes of transport including cycling, walking and the use of public transport. The development is therefore contrary to Policies DMT 1, DMT 2, DMT 5 and DMT 6 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policies T2, T4, T6 and T6.1 of the London Plan (2021) and Paragraphs 115 and 116 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2021). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020.",
    "This is a reminder that Under the terms of the Planning Act 2008 (as amended) and Community Infrastructure Levy Regulations 2010 (as amended), should an application for appeal be allowed, the proposed development would be deemed as 'chargeable development' and therefore liable to pay the London Borough of Hillingdon Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and the Mayor of London's Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This would be calculated in accordance with the London Borough of Hillingdon CIL Charging Schedule 2014 and the Mayor of London's CIL Charging Schedule 2012.
