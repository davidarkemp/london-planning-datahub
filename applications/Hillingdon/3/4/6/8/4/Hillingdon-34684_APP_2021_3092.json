    "The proposed development, by reason of its siting, design and layout, would fail to harmonise with the existing local and historic context of the surrounding area of special local character. The principle of intensifying the residential use of the site through the part loss of private gardens would have a detrimental impact on the character, appearance, visual amenities and local distinctiveness of the area. The proposal therefore conflicts with Policies HE1 and BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012), Policies DMH 6, DMHB 5, DMHB 11 and DMHB 12  of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020), Policies D3 and HC1 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "By virtue of its proximity, siting, size, scale, height and massing, the proposed dwelling would cause harm to the living conditions of the existing occupiers at numbers 2-8 Hilliard Road and their respective private amenity space, in terms of loss of outlook, overshadowing, loss of privacy and overbearing impact. The proposal therefore conflicts with Policy DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "In the absence of a satisfactory Flood Risk Assessment, the application fails to demonstrate that the development would not be at unacceptable risk of surface water flooding and furthermore, it has not been demonstrated that the development would not increase the risk of flooding to other sites, contrary to Policies DMEI 9 and 10 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020), Policies SI12 and SI13 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "This is a reminder that Under the terms of the Planning Act 2008 (as amended) and Community Infrastructure Levy Regulations 2010 (as amended), should an application for appeal be allowed, the proposed development would be deemed as 'chargeable development' and therefore liable to pay the London Borough of Hillingdon Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and the Mayor of London's Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This would be calculated in accordance with the London Borough of Hillingdon CIL Charging Schedule 2014 and the Mayor of London's CIL Charging Schedule 2012. For more information on CIL matters please visit the planning portal page at: www.planningportal.gov.uk/planning/applications/howtoapply/whattosubmit/cil",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service. We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
