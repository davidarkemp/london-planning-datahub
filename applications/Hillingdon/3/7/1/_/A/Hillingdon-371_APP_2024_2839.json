    "Condition 2 of planning permission ref. 371/AA/85/905 dated 16-08-1985 shall be reworded to read as follows:",
    "The premises shall only be used for the preparation, sale of food and drink and clearing up between the hours of 06:00 to 00:00 Monday - Sunday",
    "REASON",
    "To ensure that the amenity of the occupiers of adjoining or nearby properties is not adversely affected in accordance with Policies DMHB 11, DMTC 1 and DMTC 4 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 (2020) and Policy D13 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "Notwithstanding Condition 2, the development shall otherwise be carried out, retained, and maintained in compliance with all other approved details and conditions of planning permission ref.371/AA/85/905 dated 16-08-1985",
    "The development hereby permitted shall not be carried out except in complete accordance with the submitted Noise Impact Assessment reference 24-0120-0 R01 dated 01 October 2024 completed by Sustainable Acoustics Ltd.",
    "REASON",
    "To safeguard the amenity of surrounding areas in accordance with Policy DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 (2020).",
    "For the lifetime of the development hereby permitted the rating level (LAr) of noise caused by its operation shall not exceed: 40 dB LAr 15 min for any fifteen-minute period between 2300 and 0700, and 50 dB LAr 1 hour for any one-hour period between 0700 and 2300, determined one metre free field external to any window or door of any permanent residential, or equivalently noise sensitive premises, in accordance with 'Methods for rating and assessing industrial and commercial sound' British Standards Institution BS4142 2014.'",
    "REASON: To ensure that occupants of dwellings would not be exposed to noise caused by the permitted development that would be likely to cause an adverse effect on their health and quality of life with windows open for the purposes of ventilation and cooling.",
    "It is considered that a condition based on fixed noise levels is consistent with noise and planning policy by relating external noise levels to the point at which adverse effects on health and quality of life start to be observed. The limit values are intended to be consistent with the evidence base that is reflected in guidance: 'Guidance on Sound Insulation and Noise Reduction for Buildings' BS8233 2014. This is combined with the assessment principles and procedures detailed in guidance: 'Methods for rating and assessing industrial and commercial sound' British Standards Institution BS4142 2014.' This is used to set reference time periods for the assessment and adjust measured or calculated LAeq values for character as detailed in BS4142 to determine the rating level.",
    "The decision to GRANT planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to GRANT planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan (2021) and NPPF (2024).",
    "The Equality Act 2010 seeks to protect people accessing goods, facilities and services from discrimination on the basis of a 'protected characteristic', which includes those with a disability. As part of the Act, service providers are obliged to improve access to and within the structure of their building, particularly in situations where reasonable adjustment can be incorporated with relative ease. The Act states that service providers should think ahead to take steps to address barriers that impede disabled people."
