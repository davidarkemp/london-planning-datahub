    "The decision to GRANT planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan - The Spatial Development Strategy for London consolidated with alterations since 2011 (2016) and national guidance.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably.",
    "The Equality Act 2010 seeks to protect people accessing goods, facilities and services from discrimination on the basis of a 'protected characteristic', which includes those with a disability. As part of the Act, service providers are obliged to improve access to and within the structure of their building, particularly in situations where reasonable adjustment can be incorporated with relative ease. The Act states that service providers should think ahead to take steps to address barriers that impede disabled people.",
    "Cadent have identified operational gas apparatus within the application site boundary. This may include a legal interest (easements or wayleaves) in the land which restricts activity in proximity to Cadent assets in private land. The Applicant must ensure that proposed works do not infringe on Cadent's legal rights and any details of such restrictions should be obtained from the landowner in the first instance.",
    "If buildings or structures are proposed directly above the gas apparatus then development should only take place following a diversion of this apparatus. The Applicant should contact Cadent's Plant Protection Team at the earliest opportunity to discuss proposed diversions of apparatus to avoid any unnecessary delays.",
    "If any construction traffic is likely to cross a Cadent pipeline then the Applicant must contact Cadent's Plant Protection Team to see if any protection measures are required.",
    "All developers are required to contact Cadent's Plant Protection Team for approval b",
    "Given the nature of the proposed development it is possible that a crane may be required during its construction. We would, therefore, draw the applicant's attention to the requirement within the British Standard Code of Practice for the safe use of Cranes, for crane operators to consult the aerodrome before erecting a crane in close proximity to an aerodrome. This is explained further in Advice Note 4, 'Cranes and Other Construction Issues' (available at http://www.aoa.org.uk/policy-campaigns/operations-safety/)",
    "Wind Turbines can impact on the safe operation of aircraft through interference with aviation radar and/or due to their height. Any proposal that incorporates wind turbines must be assessed in more detail to determine the potential impacts on aviation interests.  This is explained further in Advice Note 7, 'Wind Turbines and Aviation' available at http://www.aoa.org.uk/policy-campaigns/operations-safety/",
    "There is a possibility that contaminating substances may be present in the ground at depth. We have some relatively recent (2013) site specific information of ground conditions within the site boundary of the proposed works. We would advise persons working on site to take basic precautions in relation to any contamination they may find. Remedial works were undertaken at the site, however the possibility of contamination being present at depth remains. Precautions should be taken to minimise the mixing of any material that is dug up with clean shallow soils that are to remain on site.",
    "Any tree or scrub removal should be undertaken between mid-September to February to avoid the nesting bird season.",
    "The applicant is advised that where the conditions requiring the submission of details have been discharged in connection with the original permission, the Local Planning Authority will not require these details to be re-submitted as part of this new planning permission where those details would remain the same."
