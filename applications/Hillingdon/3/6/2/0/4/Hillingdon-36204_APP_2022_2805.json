    "The proposed development, by reason of its excessive depth, size, scale, bulk, visual dominance, insubordinate and incongruous design including the large crown roof form, would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original building and the local context, established street pattern and building lines.  The proposal would be detrimental to the character and appearance of the dwelling and the visual amenities of the street scene and is therefore contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020) and Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "The proposed development, by reason of the side facing views from the rear balcony and its proximity to the neighbouring property at No.1 Ebury Close, would result in a form of development that would result in overlooking and loss of privacy. The proposal would harm the residential amenities of the neighbouring property and is therefore contrary to Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan - Part Two (2020).",
    "The site forms part of an area covered by Tree Preservation Area TPO 114. In the absence of an updated tree report, it has not been demonstrated that trees within the site will be unaffected by the development and provision has not been made for their long term protection. For these reasons, the proposal would conflict with Policies DMHB 14 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2021). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
