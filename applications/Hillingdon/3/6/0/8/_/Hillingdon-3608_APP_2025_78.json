    "The cumulative impact of the proposed extensions, particularly the proposed roof conversion, including proposed 2 no. side dormers main side extension and resulting crown roof forms would result in additions to the dwelling that would fail to respect the architectural composition of the existing dwelling and would appear as visually incongruous, overbearing and would result in a top heavy appearance to the dwelling, particularly given the openness and prominence of the plot. The proposed development would result in harm to the character and appearance of the dwelling and wider street scene, contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One Strategic (2012) and Policies DMDH 1, DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
