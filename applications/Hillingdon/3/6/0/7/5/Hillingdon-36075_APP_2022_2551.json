    "The proposed single storey side/rear extension, by reason of the prominent siting, combined height, depth and excessive width, bulk and massing would result in a dominant, excessive, bulky and unsympathetic and disproportionate addition that would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original dwelling, would be detrimental to the character and appearance of the context of which it forms a part and to the visual amenities of the prominent corner siting location, street scene and the surrounding area. Therefore, the proposal would be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012) and Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",

Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020."
