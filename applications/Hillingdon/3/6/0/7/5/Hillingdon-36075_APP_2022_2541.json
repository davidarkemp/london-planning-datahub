    "The proposed detached rear outbuilding, by reason of its combined siting, height, width, depth, plot coverage and design would result in an excessive, visually intrusive, disproportionate and overbearing addition that would dominate the host plot and fail to read as an incidental addition. The development would be detrimental to the character and appearance of the area and would be jarring to the visual amenities of this prominent corner site. Therefore, the proposal would fail to comply with Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021), Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012)and  Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12, DMHD 1 and DMHD 2 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2021). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020."
