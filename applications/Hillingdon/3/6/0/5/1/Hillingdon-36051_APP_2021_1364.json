    "The development hereby permitted shall be begun before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.",
    "REASON",
    "To comply with Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990.",
    "The development hereby permitted shall not be carried out except in complete accordance with the details shown on the submitted plan, number 4552101 Rev. E and the approved fencing/trellis shall be installed concurrently with the patio and thereafter retained and maintained in perpetuity.",
    "REASON",
    "To ensure the development complies with the provisions of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020), and the London Plan (2021).",
    "The materials to be used in the construction of the raised patio hereby permitted shall be as detailed in the application and shall thereafter be retained as such.",
    "REASON",
    "To safeguard the visual amenities of the area and to ensure that the proposed development does not have an adverse effect upon the appearance of the existing building in accordance with Policy DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 (2020)",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably.",
    "The application site forms part of a Critical Drainage Area. Accordingly, the Council's Flood and Water Management Team advise that the development should minimise the water from the application site entering the sewers. Water run off from any hard paving associated with the development should be directed to a soakaway, tank or be made permeable. No drainage to support the extension should be connected to any existing surface water network, other than as an overflow."
