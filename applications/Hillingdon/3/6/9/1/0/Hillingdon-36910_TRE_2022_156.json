    "The Western Red Cedar form a row to the front of 2 Linksway, it is believed that originally they were planted as a boundary hedge but having been left to grown and and work in 2021 to lift the lower branches to 6m they now form a line of trees. 2 Linksway is one of the first properties seen when entering the Copse Wood Estate (an Area of Special Local Character) and as a result these trees form a prominent feature and collectively have a high amenity value.",
    "The applicant's main reason for wishing to remove the Western Red Cedars is to enable them to plant a hedge for privacy. It is noted that there are already some new saplings planted below the current trees which currently appear to be establishing well and if they continue to do so should be able to create the level of privacy the resident wishes for without the need to remove the current trees. There are signs of decline with the Cedar's canopies however on balance currently their amenity value outweighs this.",
    "Having regard to",
    "The removal of deadwood, dangerous / hanging branches and ivy:  This does not require the formal consent of the Council."
