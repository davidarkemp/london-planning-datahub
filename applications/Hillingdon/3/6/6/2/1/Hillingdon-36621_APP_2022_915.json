    "The proposed extensions by reason of their size, scale, bulk, depth, siting, design, proximity to the side boundary, projection forward of the principal front building line and projection forward of the return building line along St Peters Close, in this open prominent position, would result in the closing of an important gap characteristic to the area, resulting in a cramped appearance and overdevelopment of the site. The proposal would therefore represent an overdevelopment of the site to the detriment of the appearance of the dwelling, the visual amenities of the street scene and the character and appearance of the surrounding area. The proposed development is therefore contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies and Section 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The proposed single storey rear extension by reason of its combined depth and scale in proximity to the shared boundary would result in loss of outlook from and an undue sense of enclosure to the neighbouring occupiers resulting in harm to the residential amenity of occupants of No. 11 Cambridge Drive contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies and Section 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2016). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.  A pre-application was submitted and comments made.  This led to some design changes",
    "The Council has however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reason for refusal."
