  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed development, by virtue of the poor overall layout of Flat One including the reliance of side facing habitable windows (serving Bedroom 3) there would be a harmful effect upon the living conditions of the future occupants of Flat One in terms of loss of privacy, overlooking issues, poor outlook, noise and disturbance. In addition, the front facing window (serving Bedroom 2) would be in close proximity the front access to both flats and car parking space.",
    "Furthermore the application has failed to demonstrate that there would be satisfactory amount of private usable external amenity space to serve both flats. Therefore, it would result in an unsatisfactory quality of internal and external residential accommodation to the   detriment of the amenity of the future occupiers of the proposed development, contrary to Policies DMHB 16  DMHB18 of the  Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planni",
    "In the absence of a Tree Survey and Arboricultural Implication Assessment to BS5837:2012 standards and given the proximity of the excavation works to accommodate the car parking space, the application has failed to demonstrate that the development will safeguard the long term future of the existing tree within the front garden which is subject to a Tree Preservation OrderThe proposal is therefore detrimental to the visual amenity of the street scene and the wider area contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policy DMHB 14 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policie",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan (2021)  and national guidance.",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2021). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
