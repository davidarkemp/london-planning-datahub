    "The Lawson Cypress is situated within the front garden of 68 Knoll Crescent. The tree is highly visible from the nearby properties in the road. The tree is the remnant of a removed group of trees at the location, has a moderate-to-high amenity value and makes a positive contribution to the local area.",
    "The application to remove the Cypress is supported by an arboricultural advice containing inconclusive observations of the tree health, and no diagnostic information from an appropriate expert has been supplied to justify the removal of this tree. The proposed work to remove this Cypress will substantially affect the aesthetics and visual amenity of the area and have a negative impact on the local landscape.",
    "Having regard to the reasons given for the proposed work, the work is unjustified and will have a detrimental impact on the visual amenity and arboreal character of the area.",
    "The removal of deadwood, dangerous / hanging branches and ivy:  This does not require the formal consent of the Council.",
    "Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981:  Note that it is an offence under this act to disturb roosting bats, nesting birds or any other protected species."
