    "The Oaks T1 and T2 are situated at the bottom of the rear garden of 8 Ravenscourt Close. These trees present mature and attractive crowns. Views of these can be gained between and over the roofs in Ravenscourt Close, and from the nearby field where a public footpath runs. These trees have been recently protected for their high amenity value and their significant contribution to local biodiversity making them an important feature of the local landscape, both present and future because the Oaks have the potential for long-life expectancy.",
    "The crowns of these Oaks appear healthy and in good condition. The work proposed would considerably lessen the height and spread of the appeal trees and consistently reduce their contribution to the character and appearance of the area.",
    "No arboricultural reason has been provided concerning the need to remove 3m on T1 and 4m on T2, being excessive shading not considered an arboricultural reason. No arboricultural assessment has been supplied as evidence",
    "The removal of deadwood, dangerous / hanging branches and ivy:  This does not require the formal consent of the Council.",
    "Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981:  Note that it is an offence under this act to disturb roosting bats, nesting birds or any other protected species.",
    "Statutory crown lifting of trees: This does not require formal consent of the Council if the clearance only involves the removal of branches to give a separation between the footway and the tips of the lowest branches by up to 2.3m or the carriageway by up to 5.2m."
