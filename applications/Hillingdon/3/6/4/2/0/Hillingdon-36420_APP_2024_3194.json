    "The proposed 3 bedroom, 4 person dwelling fails to meet the minimum floor space standards set out within Policy D6 of the London Plan. Additionally, it includes a unacceptably small and undersized single bedroom at first floor. Taking into consideration these points, the new dwelling is considered to provide its future residents with cramped and substandard internal living accommodation to the detriment of their amenities, contrary to Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021) and paragraph 135 of the NPPF (2024).",
    "The development would result in a harmful loss of garden land and the principle of intensifying the residential use involving the loss of existing private garden areas is considered to be unacceptable. Furthermore the development by reason of its design would fail to respect the prevailing character and appearance of the street scene and wider Barnhill Estate Area of Special Local . The development is therefore contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012), Policies DMHB 5, DMH 6, DMHB 12 and DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021) and Paragraph 128d) of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023).",
    "Due to its design and internal arrangement, the proposed dwelling would fail to meet the requirements for a M4(2) accessible and adaptable dwelling as set out in Approved Document M to the Building Regulations (2015 edition). The proposed dwelling would therefore fail to comply with Policy D7 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "Due to its excessive length and lack of crossing refuge points, the resulting vehicle crossover would create a more hazardous environment for road users and pedestrians, whilst simultaneously leading to a reduction in the free flow of traffic on the local highways network. No detailed site layout or crossover plans have been submitted to suggest otherwise. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy DMT 2 and DMT 6 of the Local Plan and Policy T4 and T6 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "By reason of its poor design and location, insufficient private amenity space would be provided for the future occupiers of the new dwelling. As such its future occupiers would have cramped and poor quality external amenity space to the detriment of their amenities. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policy DMHB 18 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan (2021) and NPPF (2024).",
    "This is a reminder that Under the terms of the Planning Act 2008 (as amended) and Community Infrastructure Levy Regulations 2010 (as amended), should an application for appeal be allowed, the proposed development would be deemed as 'chargeable development' and therefore liable to pay the London Borough of Hillingdon Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and the Mayor of London's Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This would be calculated in accordance with the London Borough of Hillingdon CIL Charging Schedule 2014 and the Mayor of London's CIL Charging Schedule 2012.",
