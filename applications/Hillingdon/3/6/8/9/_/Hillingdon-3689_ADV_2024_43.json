    "The proposed digital display, by reason of its substantially sized screen, prominent siting, luminance, and design, would result in an obtrusive and incongruous development that would harm the character and appearance of the Eastcote Village Conservation Area and the settings of the nearby Grade II Listed buildings The Black Horse P.H., K6 Telephone kiosk outside Post Office, and Old Barn House. The limited public benefits would not outweigh the identified less than substantial harm to the designated heritage assets. The proposal would neither preserve nor enhance these heritage assets. The proposal is, therefore, contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies HC1 and D3 of The London Plan (2021), Policies HE1 and BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012), and Policies DMHB 1, DMHB 2, DMHB 3, DMHB 4, DMHB 11, and DMHB 13A of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The decision to REFUSE Advertisement Consent has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE Advertisement Consent has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan (2021) and national guidance."
