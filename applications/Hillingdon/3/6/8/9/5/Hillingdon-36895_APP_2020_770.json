  "description": "Demolition of existing garage and erection of two storey side extension and part two, part single storey rear extension",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed two storey side extension by reason of its siting in this visually prominent location, its size, scale, bulk, width and design, including proximity to the side boundary and lack of a set back from the front at all levels, would result in a closing of the visually open gap between it and the neighbouring property, would fail to appear as a subordinate addition and would exacerbate the asymmetry between the pair of semi-detached houses of which it forms a part and would thus be detrimental to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "The proposed two storey rear extension, by reason of its size, scale, bulk and design would result in an awkward juxtaposition between the existing rear dormer and the roof of the proposed extension which would be detrimental to the character and appearance of the existing dwelling and the visual amenities of the street scene and the wider area. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHD 1 and DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the 'Saved' UDP 2007, Local Plan Part 1, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service."
