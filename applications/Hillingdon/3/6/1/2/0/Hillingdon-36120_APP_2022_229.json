  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed extensions by reason of their combined size, bulk, massing and design, result in an awkward an uncharacteristic set of extensions which fail to read as a sympathetic and cohesive design. The extensions relate poorly to the original architectural composition of the original dwelling and unbalance the semi-detached pair of properties. As a result the proposals have a detrimental impact on the character, appearance and of the street scene and surrounding area, all contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
