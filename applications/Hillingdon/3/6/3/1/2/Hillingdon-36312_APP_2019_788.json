  "description": "Retention of single storey outbuilding at rear of garden",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The outbuilding, by reason of its overall size, scale design and choice of materials, fails to respect the architectural character and setting of the Grade II Listed property, and is considered harmful to the significance of the Grade II Listed Building. The proposal, thus, fails to either preserve or enhance the character or appearance of the Grade II Listed property. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies BE1 and HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies BE8, BE10 and BE13 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Saved UDP Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 1 and DMHB 2 of the emerging Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies with Modifications (March 2019), Policy 7.8 of the London Plan (2016), the adopted Supplementary Planning Document HDAS: Residential Extensions and the NPPF.",
    "The outbuilding, by reason of its location, minimal set in from the northern boundary, distance from the rear boundary and overall footprint would result in a dominant addition to the rear garden, detracting from the visual amenities of the occupiers and neighbouring properties, and from the character and appearance of the wider area. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies BE13, BE15 and BE19 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Saved UDP Policies (November 2012), Policy DMHD 2 of the emerging Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies with Modifications (March 2019) and the Council's adopted Supplementary Planning Document HDAS: Residential Extensions.",
    "The applicant is advised that the outbuilding would require Listed Building Consent as it is located within the curtilage of the Grade II Listed Building."
