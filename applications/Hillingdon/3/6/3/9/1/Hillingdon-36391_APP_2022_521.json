    "The proposed dwelling fails to provide adequate parking for its future residents. The shortfall in parking is likely to result in roadside parking which would create a more hazardous environment for road users and pedestrians. The proposal would therefore result in a more dangerous environment for pedestrians and vehicle users, having an adverse impact on the free flow of traffic on the local highways network. The development is therefore contrary to Policies DMT 2 and DMT 6 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), as well as policy T4 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "Due to the proposed design, height, irregular width, siting and uncharacteristic frontage, the proposed dwelling would form a harmful and incongruous addition to the streetscene of St Luke Close. The new property would appear unusually narrow and linear when compared with other dwellings and proposes an irregular access which includes only a footpath, as well as a flank in close proximity to the rear gardens of neighbours. The proposed dwelling would therefore be detrimental to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the street and wider area. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), as well as policies D3 and D6 of the London Plan and  paragraphs 130 (a) and (c) of the NPPF (2021).",
    "Due to its size, siting, proximity, height, bulk and massing the proposed dwelling would lead to a loss of outlook from the rear bedroom and kitchen diner windows of No.10 St Luke Close as well as an overbearing sense of enclosure to the rear garden of No.13 St Nicholas Close. For the same reasons the new dwelling would have an enclosing impact on the rear patio of No.10, whilst also leading to overshadowing and a significant loss of light to these adjacent spaces. The proposal would adversely impact on the amenities and living conditions of No.10 and No.12's occupiers as a result and is therefore contrary to Policy DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies and paragraph 130 (f) of the NPPF (2021).",
    "This is a reminder that Under the terms of the Planning Act 2008 (as amended) and Community Infrastructure Levy Regulations 2010 (as amended), should an application for appeal be allowed, the proposed development would be deemed as 'chargeable development' and therefore liable to pay the London Borough of Hillingdon Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and the Mayor of London's Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This would be calculated in accordance with the London Borough of Hillingdon CIL Charging Schedule 2014 and the Mayor of London's CIL Charging Schedule 2012.",
