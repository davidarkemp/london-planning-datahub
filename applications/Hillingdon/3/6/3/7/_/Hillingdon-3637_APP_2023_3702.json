    "The proposed development, as a result of the subdivision, would result in insufficient ground floor space for a suitable Class E Use. The proposal development fails to demonstrate that the ground floor area would remain a viable unit within the existing shopping parade, thereby failing to comply with Policy DMTC 3 which requires the protection and enhancement of the function of local centres and local shopping parades contrary to Section 7 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2023, Policies E9 of the London Plan 2021, Policies E1 and E6 of the Hillingdon Local Plan (Part 1) 2012 and Policy DMTC 3 of the Hillingdon Local Plan (Part 2) 2020.",
    "The proposed ground floor flat would fail to provide a satisfactory internal living environment for their future occupiers by virtue of the proximity of the proposed habitable windows to the access road and an absence of detail of satisfactory provision of defensible space. Consequently the habitable rooms would lack an appropriate degree of privacy and would be subject to noise and disturbance from the comings and goings taking place within the parking/access court, contrary to Policy DMHB 15 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), London Plan (2021) Policy D6 and the National Planning Policy Framework (2023).",
    "The proposed development, by virtue of its poor outlook and poor levels of natural light and inadequate external amenity space provision would result in substandard forms of residential accommodation to the detriment of future occupants. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy DMHB 16 and DMHB 18 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2023).",
    "The proposed development, by virtue of its proximity and design would cause harm to the living conditions of the neighbouring occupiers  at No. 2 Merle Avenue, in terms of outlook, privacy and overlooking. The proposal therefore conflicts with Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One -Strategic Policies (2012), Policy DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2023).",
    "The proposed development has failed to provide adequate provision for 1 cycle stores. Due to the constrained nature of the site, it is questioned whether there is available space to secure a  cycle store that would not prejudice the quality of accommodation for existing or future occupiers at the site. The proposal would therefore conflict with Policies DMHB 11 and DMT 5 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2- Development Management Policies (2020), Policy T5 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2023).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "a) We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
