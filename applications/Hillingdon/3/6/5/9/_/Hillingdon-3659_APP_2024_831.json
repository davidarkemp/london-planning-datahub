    "The development hereby permitted shall be begun before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.",
    "REASON",
    "To comply with Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990.",
    "The development hereby permitted shall not be carried out except in complete accordance with the details shown on the submitted plans, numbers 2024-103-04 and 2024-103-07.",
    "REASON",
    "To ensure the development complies with the provisions of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020), and the London Plan (2021).",
    "The materials to be used in the construction of the external surfaces of the development hereby permitted shall match those used in the existing building and shall thereafter be retained as such.",
    "REASON",
    "To safeguard the visual amenities of the area and to ensure that the proposed development does not have an adverse effect upon the appearance of the existing building in accordance with Policy DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 (2020)",
    "The development hereby approved may be subject to the Construction (Design and Management) Regulations 1994, which govern health and safety through all stages of a construction project. The regulations require clients (ie. those, including developers, who commision construction projects) to appoint a planning supervisor and principal contractor who are competent and adequately resourced to carry out their health and safety responsibilities. Further information is available from the Health and Safety Executive, Rose Court, 2 Southwark Bridge Road, London, SE1 9HS (telephone 020 7556 2100).",
    "On 1 July 1997, a new act, The Party Wall etc. Act 1996, came into force.",
    "This Act requires a building owner to notify, and obtain formal agreement from, any adjoining owner, where the building owner proposes to:-",
    "1)      carry out work to an existing party wall;",
    "2)      build on the boundary with a neighbouring property;",
    "3)      in some circumstances, carry out groundworks within 6 metres of an adjoining building.",
    "Notification and agreements under this Act are the responsibility of the building owner and are quite separate from Building Regulations or planning controls. Building Control will assume that an applicant has obtained any necessary agreements with the adjoining owner, and nothing said or implied by Building Control should be taken as removing the necessity for the building owner to comply fully with the Act."
