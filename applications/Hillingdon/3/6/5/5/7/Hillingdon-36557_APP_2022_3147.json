    "The proposed front development, by reason of its height, design and siting would result in a fortified appearance to the site which would fail to respect the established character and appearance of the host property and wider streetscene. The proposal would result in in a harmful loss of openness along this part of Northwood Road, detrimental to the established character and appearance of the area. As such the proposal is contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12, DMHB 14 and DMEI 6 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "Due to the height, siting and close proximity of the gate to the carriageway, the proposal would have an unacceptable impact on highway and pedestrian safety. The proposal would increase potential for conflict or near misses with northbound traffic. The proposal also has a hazardous impact on visibility as it impedes important sight lines. The proposed development would therefore be unacceptable in terms of highway and pedestrian safety and would be considered to be contrary to Policies DMT 2 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020)."
