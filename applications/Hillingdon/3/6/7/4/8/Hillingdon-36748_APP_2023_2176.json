    "The proposed development by reason of its siting, scale, massing and design would result in a oversized, incongruous and harmfully dominant form of development. Consequently, the proposed development would be detrimental to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area. Additionally, the proposed car park to the rear of the site would form an isolated and uncharacteristic addition to the street scene, causing further harm to its visual amenities. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012), Policies DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policies D1 and D3 of the London Plan (2021) and Chapter 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023).",
    "Due to its depth, scale, siting and design, the proposed development would be overbearing and would lead to a harmful sense of enclosure, loss of outlook from and loss of light to No. 12 Oakwood Road, thus significantly harming the residential amenity enjoyed by the occupiers of this neighbouring property. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policy DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2023).",
    "The proposed development would fail to provide private external amenity space of sufficient accessibility and quality for the proposed homes resulting in substandard living conditions for prospective residents contrary to Policy DMHB 18 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2023).",
    "The proposed ground floor Flat 2 would fail to provide a satisfactory internal living environment for future occupiers by virtue of the proximity of a habitable room side window to the shared communal access to the rear gardens, cycle and parking spaces. Consequently this habitable room would lack an appropriate degree of privacy and would be subject to noise and disturbance from the comings and goings of residents accessing their gardens, cycles and parked vehicles, contrary to Policy DMHB 15 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), London Plan (2021) Policy D6 and the National Planning Policy Framework (2023).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan (2021) and national guidance.",
    "This is a reminder that Under the terms of the Planning Act 2008 (as amended) and Community Infrastructure Levy Regulations 2010 (as amended), should an application for appeal be allowed, the proposed development would be deemed as 'chargeable development' and therefore liable to pay the London Borough of Hillingdon Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and the Mayor of London's Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This would be calculated in accordance with the London Borough of Hillingdon CIL Charging Schedule 2014 and the Mayor of London's CIL Charging Schedule 2012.",
