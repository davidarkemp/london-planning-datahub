    "The proposed development does not constitute permitted development by virtue of the provisions of Schedule 2, Part 3, Class O of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended). This application fails to provide sufficient evidence to demonstrate beyond reasonable doubt that the site at No 3C High Road, Eastcote was in use as an administrative office (Use Class B1a) on 29th May 2013.",
    "The proposed development does not constitute permitted development by virtue of the provisions of Schedule 2, Part 3, Class O of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 2015 (as amended), as the proposal does not demonstrate that there would not be any impacts of noise from commercial premises on the intended occupiers of the development. Therefore the development is considered to result in a substandard level of residential accommodation.",
    "The proposed development does not constitute permitted development by virtue of the provisions of Schedule 2, Part 3, Class O of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 2015 (as amended), as the proposal does not demonstrate that there would not be any contamination risks on the site. Therefore the development is considered to result in potential contamination risks.",
    "The Application does not demonstrate that surface water run off can be controlled to ensure that the development would not increase the risk of flooding contrary to Policy EM6 in Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1- Strategic Policies (Nov 2012); Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 Saved Unitary Development Plan Policy OE8; Draft Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Polices with Modifications (March 2019) Policy DMEI 10; Policies 5.12, 5.13 and 5.15 of the London Plan (March 2016); the National Planning Policy Framework (2019); and the Planning Practice Guidance (Flood Risk and Coastal Change March 2014)."
