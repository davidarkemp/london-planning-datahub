    "The proposed part two storey/part single storey rear extension, by reason of its excessive depth, size, scale, bulk and design, would be a disproportionate addition to the host building that would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original dwelling. The proposal would therefore be detrimental to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the host dwelling, and the surrounding area, contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12",

Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020."
