    "The Oak is situated within the PROW R3 and has a high amenity value. The proposed removal of T6 would create a gap in the row of mature trees along the public footpath thus significantly reducing the aesthetic and amenity value of this as well as disrupting a valuable wildlife corridor, thus having a significant and adverse impact on the local environment.",
    "Having regard to the reasons given for the proposed work, the work will have a detrimental impact on the visual amenity and arboreal character of the area.",
    "The removal of deadwood, dangerous / hanging branches and ivy:  This does not require the formal consent of the Council."
