  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed outbuilding by virtue of its detailed design and proximity to the boundary, would result in harm to the character and appearance of the site, the adjoining properties and the wider area. As such the outbuilding would be contrary to Policies DMHB 11, DMHD 1 and DMHD 2  of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "The proposed outbuilding, by virtue of its excessive height and proximity to the boundary, would be detrimental to the amenities of the adjoining occupiers at No. 7 Southcote Rise by reason of over dominance, visual intrusion and perceived overlooking. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policies DMHB 11, DMHD 1 and DMD 2 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan - The Spatial Development Strategy for London consolidated with alterations since 2011 (2016) and national guidance.",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2016). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020."
