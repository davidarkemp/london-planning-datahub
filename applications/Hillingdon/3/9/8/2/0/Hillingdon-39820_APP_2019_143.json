    "The proposed crossover, by reason of its siting in close proximity to the existing central pedestrian refuge in Rickmansworth Road, which forms an informal pedestrian crossing and the increase in the number of potential conflict points along the road would be prejudicial to highway and pedestrian safety by virtue of conflict between pedestrian and vehicular movements generated by the address and further exacerbated by the high traffic flows on Rickmansworth Road, contrary to Policies AM7 and AM14 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Saved UDP Policies (November 2012) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document HDAS: Residential Extensions.",
    "In the absence of a Tree Survey and Arboricultural Implication Assessment to BS5837:2012 standards, the application has failed to demonstrate that the development will safeguard the existing street tree to the front of the site and fails to demonstrate the long-term retention of the tree. The proposal would therefore be detrimental to the visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area generally, contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies BE13 and BE38 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Saved UDP Policies (November 2012) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document HDAS: Residential Extensions.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. The Council's supports pre-application discussions. As such, the Council has however been unable to achieve a solution to problems arising from the application which would overcome the reasons for refusal."
