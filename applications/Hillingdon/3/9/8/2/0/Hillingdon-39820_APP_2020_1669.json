    "The proposed staircase by reason of its location, design and appearance would constitute an incongruous form of development that would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original dwelling and would be detrimental to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "The proposed staircase, by virtue of its siting and proximity, would be detrimental to the amenities of the adjoining occupier at 'Newlands' by reason of overlooking and loss of privacy. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies.",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then policies from the Council's Local Plan Part Two-Development Management Policies, then London Plan Policies (2016)."
