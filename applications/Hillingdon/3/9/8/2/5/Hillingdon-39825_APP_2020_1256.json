    "The development hereby permitted shall be begun before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.",
    "REASON",
    "To comply with Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990.",
    "The development hereby permitted shall not be carried out except in complete accordance with the details shown on the submitted plans, numbers DE(0)001 (Proposed Floor Plan) and shall thereafter be retained/maintained for as long as the development remains in existence.",

With regards to servicing the plan must identify process, internal storage locations, scheduling of deliveries and staffing, and set out how it will be carried out in a sensitive manner to ensure noise and highway impacts are minimised.",
    "Thereafter, the measures included in the approved Operational Management Plan shall be carried out at all times that the Public House is in use.",
    "REASON",
    "To ensure that the development  is in accordance with Local Plan: Part 2 Development Plan Policies DMHB 11, DMT 1, DMT 2 & DMT 6 and Policies 6.3, 6.9, and 6.13 of the London Plan (2016).",

    "The Equality Act 2010 seeks to protect people accessing goods, facilities and services from discrimination on the basis of a 'protected characteristic', which includes those with a disability. As part of the Act, service providers are obliged to improve access to and within the structure of their building, particularly in situations where reasonable adjustment can be incorporated with relative ease. The Act states that service providers should think ahead to take steps to address barriers that impede disabled people.",
