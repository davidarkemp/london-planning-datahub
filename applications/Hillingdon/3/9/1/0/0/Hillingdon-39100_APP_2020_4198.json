  "description": "Part two storey, part first floor side extension",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed two storey side extension by reason of its size, scale, bulk and proximity to the side boundary, would give rise to a cramped form of development which would be detrimental to the visual amenities of the street scene and would fail to either preserve or enhance the character or appearance of the surrounding Rockingham Bridge Conservation Area. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies BE1 and HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 1, DMHB 4, DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), Policy 7.8 of the London Plan (2016) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2019).",
    "The proposed development, by virtue of its failure to maintain an adequate amount of private usable external amenity space for the occupiers of the extended property, would result in an over-development of the site detrimental to the residential amenity of existing and future occupiers. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies DMHD 1 and DMHB 18 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020)."
