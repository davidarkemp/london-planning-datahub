    "The proposed first floor side extension, by reason of its overall size and proximity to the side boundary, would result in overshadowing and the closing of the visually open gap between it and the neighbouring property, no. 27 Hyde Way, giving rise to a cramped form of development, which would be detrimental to the visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area generally.  The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "The proposed first floor side extension, by reason of its size, scale, bulk, depth and roof design would be a discordant and incongruous addition which would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original dwelling, would be detrimental to the character and appearance of the pair of semi-detached houses of which it forms a part and to the visual amenities of the surrounding area. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "The proposed development fails to provide sufficient private amenity space of a quantity and quality commensurate to the size and number of bedrooms in the development proposed. The shortfall in private amenity space identified would result in a poor quality residential environment for future occupiers, contrary to Policy BE1 of the Local Plan: Part One (2012), Policies DMHB 11 and DMHB 18 of the Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and Para 127 of the NPPF (2019).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan - The Spatial Development Strategy for London consolidated with alterations since 2011 (2016) and national guidance.",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2016). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020."
