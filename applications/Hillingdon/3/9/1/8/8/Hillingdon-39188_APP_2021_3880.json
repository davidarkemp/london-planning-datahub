    "The proposed first floor side extension, by reason of its form and roof design, whilst also having regard to pre-existing extensions to the original dwellinghouse, would be a discordant and incongruous addition which would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original dwelling, would be detrimental to the character and appearance of the pair of semi-detached houses of which it forms a part and to the visual amenities of the surrounding area. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "The proposed development fails to provide sufficient private amenity space of a quantity and quality commensurate to the size and number of bedrooms in the development proposed. The shortfall in private amenity space identified would result in a poor quality residential environment for future occupiers, contrary to Policy BE1 of the Local Plan: Part One (2012) and Policies DMHB 11 and DMHB 18 of the Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) .",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
