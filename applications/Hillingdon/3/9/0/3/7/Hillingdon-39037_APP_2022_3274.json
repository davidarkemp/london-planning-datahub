    "The proposed extension, in particular the first floor side element, by reason of the prominent open siting, combined height, depth and in particular excessive width, would result in a visually intrusive, disproportionate, incongruous, dominant and excessive addition that would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original dwelling, relationship with the attached semi-detached neighbour, visual amenities of the streetscene and would disrupt and negatively enclose the open nature of the nearby corner properties of which the site forms a part to.Therefore, the proposal would be contrary to Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021), Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012), Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2021). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020."
