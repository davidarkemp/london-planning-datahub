    "The Willow is located in the rear garden of 21 Kirby Close. The mature tree appears to be in a poor to moderate condition. The tree is primarily visible from the applicant's property and neighbouring gardens. While it contributes to the local green character, its visibility and prominence are limited, giving it a moderate amenity value overall.",
    "This application has been refused as no supporting evidence has been provided to demonstrate that the tree poses a danger.",
    "The photographs submitted show an apparent cavity with a ruler indicating a depth of 18\". However, there is no reference to the overall stem diameter, so it is not possible to assess whether this cavity exceeds the threshold for concern (i.e. the t/R ratio). Cavities alone are not sufficient grounds for felling; many trees with internal decay or hollowness can remain structurally stable for decades, depending on species, location, and extent of decay.",
    "The photos also show a high percentage of live crown, which contradicts",
    "The removal of deadwood, dangerous / hanging branches and ivy:  This does not require the formal consent of the Council.",
    "Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981:  Note that it is an offence under this act to disturb roosting bats, nesting birds or any other protected species.  Therefore, if applicable, it is advisable to consult your tree surgeon / consultant to agree an acceptable time for carrying out the approved works.",
    "Owner(s)'s permission:  Permission should be sought from the owner(s) of the tree(s) and / or the owner(s) of the land that the tree(s) overhang prior to any approved work being carried out.",
    "Expected standard of tree work: The approved works must be carried out in accordance with the conditions laid out above. If they are not, then enforcement action could being taken which could lead to prosecution and heavy fines. Therefore, it is highly recommended that the works are only carried out by a professional and competent arboriculturist who undertakes to comply with the conditions of this consent and in accordance with industry best practice (BS 3998:2010). The Arboricultural Association can provide details of its approved contractors, who have demonstrated such professionalism and competence, on their website (www.trees.org.uk) or by calling 01242 522152. Or on request the Council can provide a list of contractors who are known to carry out tree work to a good standard and to normally maintain an appropriate policy of indemnity insurance."
