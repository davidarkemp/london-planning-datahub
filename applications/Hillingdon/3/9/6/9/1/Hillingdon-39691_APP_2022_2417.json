    "The proposed extensions by reason of their size, siting, bulk and design  would fail to read as subordinate to the host dwelling, harming its architectural integrity. The proximity to the boundary would also result in the harmful loss of a first floor gap and an associated terracing effect, which would appear cramped and incongruous with the character and appearance of the wider street scene. As a result the development as a whole would fail to comply with Policies DMHD1 and DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020)."
