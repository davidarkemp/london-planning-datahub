    "The trees are situated within the grounds of The Poplars Care Home. The oak is situated at the front of the property close to Ickenham Road, and is in a prominent position along Ickenham Road (B466). The tree is in a good condition and has a high amenity value.",
    "The purple plum is situated on the western boundary of the Care Home, next door to Ruislip Methodist Church. The tree appears to be in a moderate condition and, due to the location of this tree being off of the main road, has a moderate amenity value.",
    "The proposal has been refused for the following reasons:",
    "English oak: There is no valid arboricultural reasons provided in the application to warrant a 20% crown reduction. This is considered too severe and unnecessary in relation to dealing with the reasons provided of being close to the road. If work would like to be done to the tree for the reason of it being close to the road, a crown lift or a reduction on selected branches would be a more appropriate work specification.",
    "The removal of deadwood, dangerous / hanging branches and ivy:  This does not require the formal consent of the Council.",
    "Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981:  Note that it is an offence under this act to disturb roosting bats, nesting birds or any other protected species.  Therefore, if applicable, it is advisable to consult your tree surgeon / consultant to agree an acceptable time for carrying out the approved works.",
    "Owner(s)'s permission:  Permission should be sought from the owner(s) of the tree(s) and / or the owner(s) of the land that the tree(s) overhang prior to any approved work being carried out.",
    "Works to trees protected by Conservation Area: The Council has not made a Tree Preservation Order to protect the other trees outlined in your application and therefore you can proceed with the work specified in your application / notice. Under Section 211 (3) (b) (ii) of the Act, the work must be completed before the expiry of two years from the date of your application, after which a further notice of intent to carry out the work will be required.",
    "Expected standard of tree work: The approved works must be carried out in accordance with the conditions laid out above. If they are not, then enforcement action could being taken which could lead to prosecution and heavy fines. Therefore, it is highly recommended that the works are only carried out by a professional and competent arboriculturist who undertakes to comply with the conditions of this consent and in accordance with industry best practice (BS 3998:2010). The Arboricultural Association can provide details of its approved contractors, who have demonstrated such professionalism and competence, on their website (www.trees.org.uk) or by calling 01242 522152. Or on request the Council can provide a list of contractors who are known to carry out tree work to a good standard and to normally maintain an appropriate policy of indemnity insurance."
