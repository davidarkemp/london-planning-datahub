    "The development by reason of its scale, design, bulk and massing, would result in a visually dominant, insubordinate and incongruous form of development that fails to harmonise with the architectural composition of the host dwelling to the detriment of the character, appearance and visual amenities of the Hillingdon Court Park Area of Special Local Character. The development therefore conflicts with Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One (2012), Policies DMHB 5, DMHB 11, DMHB 12  and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two (2020) and Policy D3 of The London Plan (2021) and Chapters 12 and 16 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2024).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2021). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020.",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
