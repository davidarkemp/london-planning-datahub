    "The proposed development by reason of its siting, design, size, bulk and appearance would appear incongruous, boxy and overly prominent, failing to harmonise with the existing architectural features of the host buildings and wider street scene. The proposal would therefore result in visual harm to the street scene of Corwell Lane and the wider area, all contrary to Policies DMHD1 and DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two: Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
