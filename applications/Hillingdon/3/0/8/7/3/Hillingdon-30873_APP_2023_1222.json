    "The proposed development by reason of its design, siting, flat roof, bulk, excessive scale and positioning would engulf and subsume the original property and appear as an incongruous, disjointed form of development that fails to compliment the prevailing pattern of development in the locality and would be harmful to the character and appearance of the host property and surrounding area, contrary to the aims and requirements of Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1, Policy D4 of D8 of the London Plan (2021) and Policies DMHB11, DMHB12 and DMHD1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan - Part Two (2020).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "a) We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
