    "The proposed development by reason of its height, design, siting, bulk and massing would result in a discordant and unsympathetic addition to the dwelling which would result in an oversized roof and the harmful loss of an important, established gap between the application property and No.57 Mellow Lane East, harming the character and appearance of the site and streetscene, failing to respond to local character and context or read as subordinate to the main house. The proposal is therefore considered contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB11, DMHB12 and DMHD1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan - Part Two (2020) and Policies D4 and D6 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
