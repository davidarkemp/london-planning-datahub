    "The development, by reason of its overall design, scale, bulk of the revised roof form, in particular the half hipped roof design would result in an excessive, incongruous, dominant and visually intrusive form of development that would harm the character, appearance and visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012), Policy DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy D3 and D8 of the London Plan (2021) and Paragraphs 139 and 140 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023).",
    "The proposed development, by reason of the increased number of bedrooms would result in inadequate private amenity space provisions. This would be detrimental to the amenity of the current and any future occupiers of 1-3 Haystall Close, and would give rise to a substandard form of accommodation. As such, the proposal would be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One Strategic Policies (2012) and Policy DMHB 18 of the  Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020)"
