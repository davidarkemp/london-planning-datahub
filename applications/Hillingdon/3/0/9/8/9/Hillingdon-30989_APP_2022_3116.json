    "The constructed covered structure, by reason of its design, materials and siting and when viewed collectively against the other structures and outbuildings within the rear garden, appears as an incongruous and visually obtrusive form of development which is detrimental to the visual amenity of the application site and the surrounding area.  The proposal therefore conflicts with Policies BE1 and HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One- Strategic Policies (2012) , Policies DMHD 2 , DMHB 1, and DMHB 11  of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020), and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The constructed covered structure, by virtue of the combined impacts arising from the design, materials, siting, height and overall scale, has caused harm to the residential amenities of the existing occupiers at No. 146 Pine Gardens, 51 Coombe Drive and the Bowling Green, in terms of deterioration of the outlook and visual intrusion. The proposal is therefore be contrary to Policy DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (January 2020) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service. We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal and its retrospective nature is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
