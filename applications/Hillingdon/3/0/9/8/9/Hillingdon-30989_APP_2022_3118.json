    "No Basement Impact Assessment has been submitted in support of the application. In the absence of such an assessment, the applicant has failed to demonstrate that the proposal would not or has not caused unacceptable harm to the built and natural environment and local amenity and that it would not result in flooding or ground instability. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy DMHD 3 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The constructed side extension to the existing outbuilding, by reason of its siting, and design and when viewed collectively against the other structures and outbuildings within the rear garden appears as an incongruous and visually obtrusive form of development which is detrimental to the visual amenity of the application site and the surrounding area.  The proposal therefore conflicts with Policies BE1 and HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One- Strategic Policies (2012) , Policies DMHD 2 , DMHB 1, and DMHB 11  of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020), and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service. We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
