    "The proposed extensions, particularly the proposed roof conversion, including proposed 4 no. side dormers would result in additions to the dwelling that would fail to respect the architectural composition of the existing dwelling and would appear as visually incongruous, overbearing and would result in a top heavy appearance to the dwelling, particularly given the openness and prominence of the plot. In addition, the loss of soft landscaping to the front of the dwelling would result in harm to the character and appearance of the dwelling and wider street scene, contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One Strategic (2012) and Policies DMDH 1, DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably. In addition further guidance was offered to the applicant by the case officer during the processing of the application to identify the amendments to address those elements of the scheme considered unacceptable which the applicant chose not to implement."
