    "The constructed boundary treatment, by virtue of its siting, scale, width, height and design, appears an incongruous and prominent feature within the street scene, out of character with the open frontages of the neighbouring properties in this section of Woodgate Crescent. Furthermore, the constructed boundary treatment has significantly eroded the openness of the street scene by reducing the visibility between the property at No.10 and the highway. The proposal has significantly harmed the character, appearance and visual amenities of the area and the surrounding Gatehill Farm Estate, Northwood, Area of Special Local Character. The proposal therefore conflicts with Policies BE1 and HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One Strategic Policies (2012), Policies DMHD 1, DMHB 5, DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the  Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policies D3, D4 and HC1 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021)."
