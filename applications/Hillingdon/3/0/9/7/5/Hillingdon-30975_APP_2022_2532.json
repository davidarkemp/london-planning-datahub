    "The proposed canopy in conjunction with the existing single storey rear extension, by virtue of its size, scale, bulk, depth and proximity, would be detrimental to the amenities of the adjoining occupiers at number 40 Greencroft Avenue, by reason of overdominance, overshadowing and loss of outlook. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The proposed canopy, in conjunction with the existing single storey rear extension, by virtue of its size, scale, bulk, depth and use of materials, would appear as a disproportionate and unsympathetic addition to the original dwelling and would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original semi-detached dwelling, resulting in an overdevelopment of the site which would be detrimental to the character, appearance and symmetry of the pair of semi-detached bungalows of which it forms a part and to the visual amenities of the street scene and the character of the surrounding area. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policies DMHD 1 and DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021) and Chapter 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021)."
