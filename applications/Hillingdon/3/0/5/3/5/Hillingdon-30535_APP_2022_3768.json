    "Due to its height, bulk, design and siting (on the roof of the existing dwelling) the proposed extension would make the property's front elevation top heavy, harming its existing visual balance and original architectural composition. Furthermore the proposed extension would protrude above the existing ridgeline forming an incongruous and unduly prominent addition to the area, which would harm its character and appearance. The extension would also break and unbalance the visual symmetry which currently exists between the row of houses along Hartshill Close, such visual symmetry characterises the area and therefore the proposal would cause additional harm to the areas appearance and character. Additionally, the resulting height would form an uncharacteristic addition the street scene.",
    "It is therefore considered that the proposal fails to comply with Schedule 2, Part 1, Class AA, paragraph AA.2.(3)(ii) of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2020"
