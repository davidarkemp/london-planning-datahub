  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed development, by reason of its siting and layout would result in a development of the site, which would fail to harmonise with the existing local and historic context of the surrounding area. The principle of intensifying the residential use of the site as proposed, as well as the proposed loss of existing private rear garden area would have a detrimental impact on the street scene and character and appearance of the area as a whole. The proposal is therefore detrimental to the visual amenity and character of the surrounding area and contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012),  Policies DMH 6, DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the adopted Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), Policies D1, D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021) and the NPPF.",
    "The proposed development, by reason of its siting, size, scale and design, including its gabled roof form, set forward of the building line along Bedford Road and proximity to the front boundary, would fail to harmonise with the character and architectural composition of surrounding properties, appearing as an awkward, incongruous and cramped form of development which would be detrimental to the visual amenity of the street scene and harmful to the character and appearance of the surrounding area, contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the of the adopted Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), Policies D1, D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021) and the NPPF.",
    "The proposal would provide an indoor living area of an unsatisfactory size and quality for the future occupiers of the proposed dwelling and would therefore give rise to a substandard form of living accommodation to the detriment of the amenity of future occupiers. The proposal is thus contrary to Policy DMHB 16 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies, Policy D6 and Table 3.1 of the London Plan (2021) and the Technical Housing Standards - Nationally Described Space Standard (March 2015)..",
    "The proposed development fails to provide sufficient on-plot parking and therefore the development is considered to result in substandard car parking provision, leading to on-street parking/queuing to the detriment of public and highway safety and contrary to policies DMT 2 and DMT 6 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), to Hillingdon's Adopted Parking Standards as set out in Appendix C of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020) and Policy T6 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "The proposed development by virtue of its size, scale, bulk, and proximity, would be detrimental to the amenities of the adjoining occupiers at 22 and 24 Stafford Road by reason of overdominance, visual intrusion and loss of outlook. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policies DMH 6 and DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service."
