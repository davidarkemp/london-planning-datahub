  "description": "Change of use to day nursery for 20 children aged up to 5 years old (Application for Prior Approval under the Town and Country Planning General Permitted Development (GPD) Order 2015 (Class T - Part 3 of Schedule 2) (as amended))",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed development does not constitute permitted development by virtue of the provisions of Part 3, Class T of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended) as in the absence of a full Transport Appraisal and information relating to any anticipated on-plot/on-street parking demand and vehicular activity profiles for the nursery related activities, the proposal has not demonstrated that sufficient parking arrangements would be provided, and therefore the development is considered to result in conditions prejudicial to public and highway safety and contrary to policies DMCI 1A, DMT 2, DMT 5 and DMT 6 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020) and to Hillingdon's Adopted Parking Standards as set out in Appendix C of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "The proposed development does not constitute permitted development by virtue of the provisions of Part 3, Class T of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended) as the proposal has not demonstrated that sufficient mitigation measures would be provided to protect the occupants of nearby residential dwellings from noise and is therefore in conflict with  Policy DMCI 1A of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service. We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
