    "The proposal is for a detached structure which, by reason of its size, scale and design is considered capable of independent occupation from the main dwelling and is thus tantamount to a separate dwelling in a position where such a dwelling would not be acceptable. The proposal is therefore contrary to policies DMHB 11, DMT 6, DMHB 18 and DMHD 2 of the London Borough of Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The proposed extended outbuilding, by virtue of its excessive size, scale, bulk, siting and design would be wholly uncharacteristic of the area and would represent an intrusive addition to the site, which would visually compete with the host dwelling and be harmful to the established character and appearance of the local area and visual amenities of the street scene in conflict with Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DHMB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 2 of the London Borough of Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
