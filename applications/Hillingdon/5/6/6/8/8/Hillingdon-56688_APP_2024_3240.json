    "The development, by reason of its resulting disjointed appearance and poor design when taking into account other existing/previous additions, has created an unsympathetic visual appearance, affecting the architectural composition of the host dwelling and the character and appearance of the surrounding area which is largely made up of properties with smaller rear extensions. Therefore the proposal has had a harmful impact on the character and appearance of the host dwelling and surrounding area, contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One Strategic Policies (2012) and Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "Due to its depth, design (which includes side facing windows) and siting, the part retrospective development would be overbearing to the occupiers of the neighbouring property No.87 Falling Lane and could lead to a loss of privacy to the rear garden and rear habitable rooms of this neighbouring property. It is therefore considered that the proposed development would have an adverse impact on the amenities of the occupiers of No.87 Falling Lane. The development is therefore contrary to Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), as well as Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021) and paragraph 135 (f) of the NPPF 2024."
