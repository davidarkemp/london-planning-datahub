    "The development would provide an indoor living area of an unsatisfactory size for the future occupiers of the proposed flats and would therefore give rise to a substandard form of living accommodation to the detriment of the amenity of future occupiers. The proposal is thus contrary to Policy 3.5 and Table 3.3 of the London Plan (2016), Policy DMHB 16 of the emerging Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies with Modifications (March 2019), the Housing Standards Minor Alterations to The London Plan (March 2016), the Mayor of London's adopted Supplementary Planning Guidance - Housing (March 2016) and the Technical Housing Standards - Nationally Described Space Standard (March 2015).",
    "The proposal would provide a bedroom within Flat B of an unsatisfactory size for future occupiers and would therefore give rise to a substandard form of living accommodation to the detriment of the amenity of future occupiers. The proposal is thus contrary to Policy 3.5 and Table 3.3 of the London Plan (2016), Policy DMHB 16 of the emerging Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies with Modifications (March 2019), the Housing Standards Minor Alterations to The London Plan (March 2016), the Mayor of London's adopted Supplementary Planning Guidance - Housing (March 2016) and the Technical Housing Standards - Nationally Described Space Standard (March 2015).",
    "The proposal would result in very poor levels of natural/sunlight and outlook for bedroom 1 of Flat A due to its proximity to the site boundary wall. The proposal would therefore give rise to a substandard form of living accommodation and reliance upon artificial means of lighting to the detriment of the amenity of future occupiers. The proposal is thus contrary to Policies BE19, BE20 and BE21 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Saved UDP Policies (November 2012), Policies 3.5 and 5.3 of the London Plan (2016), the Council's adopted Supplementary Planning Documents HDAS: Residential Extensions and HDAS: Residential Layouts and the Mayor of London's adopted Supplementary Planning Guidance - Housing (March 2016).",
    "The proposal has not demonstrated that sufficient off street parking/manoeuvring/access arrangements would be provided, and therefore the development is considered to result in substandard car parking provision to the Council's approved car parking standard, leading to on-street parking/queuing to the detriment of public and highway safety and contrary to policy AM14 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Unitary Development Plan Saved Policies (November 2012), to Hillingdon's Adopted Parking Standards as set out in the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Unitary Development Plan Saved Policies (November 2012), Policy DMT6 of the emerging Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies with Modifications (March 2019) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document HDAS: Residential Layouts.",
    "The proposal would result in more than 10% of properties on a residential street being redeveloped into flats to the detriment of the character and appearance of the street scene and surrounding area. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy BE13 and BE19 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Saved UDP Policies (November 2012), Policy DMH 4 of the Emerging Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies with Modifications (March 2019) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document HDAS: Residential Layouts.",
    "The proposal fails to demonstrate that as a result of the conversion of the existing dwelling into 2 self contained flats, the development would provide adequate private usable amenity space for the said units. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policy BE23 Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Saved UDP Policies (November 2012), Policy DMHB 18 of the emerging Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies with Modifications (March 2019) and to the Council's Supplementary Planning Documents HDAS Residential Layouts.",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Unitary Development Plan Saved Policies (September 2007) as incorporated into the Hillingdon Local Plan (2012) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan - The Spatial Development Strategy for London consolidated with alterations since 2011 (2016) and national guidance.",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant saved policies (referred to as policies from the Hillingdon Unitary Development Plan - Saved Policies September 2007), then London Plan Policies (2016).  On the 8th November 2012 Hillingdon's Full Council agreed the adoption of the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies. Appendix 5 of this explains which saved policies from the old Unitary Development (which was subject to a direction from Secretary of State in September 2007 agreeing that the policies were 'saved') still apply for development control decisions.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the 'Saved' UDP 2007, Local Plan Part 1, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
