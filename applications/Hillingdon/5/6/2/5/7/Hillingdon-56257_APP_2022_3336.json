    "Please note that works to trees must be undertaken outside of the nesting season as required by the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981. All birds, their nests and eggs are protected by law and it is thus an offence, with certain exceptions. It is an offence to intentionally take, damage or destroy the nest of any wild bird whilst it is in use or being built, or to intentionally or recklessly disturb any wild bird listed on Schedule 1 while it is nest building, or at a nest containing eggs or young, or disturb the dependent young of such a bird. The maximum penalty that can be imposed for an offence under the Wildlife and Countryside Act - in respect of a single bird, nest or egg - is a fine of up to Â£5,000, and/or six months' imprisonment. You are advised that the official UK nesting season is February until August.",
    "The applicant is advised that to comply with the condition relating to the standard of works to trees, the work should be carried out in accordance with British Standard BS 5837:2012 \"Trees in relation to design, demolition and construction - Recommendations\"."
