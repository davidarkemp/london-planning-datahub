    "In the absence of an Arboricultural Impact Assessment, Method Statement and Tree Protection Plan, the application has failed to demonstrate that the proposed development could be constructed without undue harm to the trees at the site, including trees protected by TPO 400. The potential harm caused to the trees would undermine the character and visual amenity of the area. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One Strategic Policies (2012) and Policies DMHB 1, DMHB 5, DMHB 11, DMHB 12, DMHB 14 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2: Development Management Policies (2020), Policy 5.10 of the London Plan (2016) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2019).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2016). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020."
