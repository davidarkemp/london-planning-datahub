    "The proposed rear extensions by reason of their scale, siting and design would result in an incongruous and visually intrusive form of development, which would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original property, would be detrimental to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the street scene and would fail to either preserve or enhance the character or appearance of the surrounding Ruislip Village Conservation Area. The proposal would result in less than substantial harm to the conservation area with no public benefits identified. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies BE1 and HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 1, DMHB 4 and DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), Policies D3 and HC1 of the London Plan (2021) and Chapters 12 and 16 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023).",
    "The proposed development, by virtue of its siting, size, scale, bulk, height and proximity, would be detrimental to the amenities of the adjoining residents at 88A High Street, by reason of overdominance, overshadowing, visual intrusion, loss of light and loss of outlook to and from a habitable room window and private amenity space. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "a) We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
