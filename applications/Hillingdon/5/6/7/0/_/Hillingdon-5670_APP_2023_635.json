    "The proposed two storey side extension, by reason of its size, scale, bulk and proximity to the side boundary, would result in a closing of the visually open gap between it and the neighbouring property, 5 Hamilton Road, giving rise to a cramped form of development, which would be detrimental to the visual amenities of the street scene and the wider Orchard Drive, Hamilton Road, Clayton Way Area of Special Local Character. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12, DMHD 1 and DMHB 5 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",

The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12, DMHD 1 and DMHB 5 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "The proposed two storey side extension, by virtue of its height, bulk and proximity/setback form the boundary, would be detrimental to the amenities of the adjoining occupier at 5 Hamilton Road by reason of overdominance, overshadowing, visual intrusion, loss of light and loss of outlook. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",

We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "In order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably. In addition further guidance was offered to the applicant by the case officer during the processing of the application to identify the amendments to address those elements of the scheme considered unacceptable. However, the amendments required to make the application acceptable are substantial and would materially change the development proposal. They would require further consultation to be undertaken pri"
