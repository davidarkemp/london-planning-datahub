    "The proposed development, given the number of potential occupants across 7no. separate bedrooms would give rise to undue noise and general disturbance to neighbouring residents, particularly as a result of a marked increase in comings and goings, use of the rear garden and the lack of information relating to sound insulation. The proposal would therefore be contrary to the requirements of Policies DMH 5 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and paragraph 130 (f) of the NPPF (2021).",
    "Due to its size, cramped design, limited usable space and access to undersized communal space,  bedroom 7 of the proposed HMO would provide its future occupants with a poor standard of living accommodation to the detriment of their amenities. Additionally, occupiers and visitors to the proposed HMO would have direct views into the bedrooms windows of rooms 2 and 3 when accessing the sites rear garden, subsequently occupiers of those rooms would have no privacy to the detriment of their amenities. Furthermore, all 7 residents of the property would be provided with inadequately sized communal living space (due to the undersized kitchen diner and lack of other communal space within the building), confining them to their rooms and creating a unsatisfactory and poor level of living accommodation which would harm their amenities. The proposal is therefore considered to be contrary to paragraph 130 (f) of the NPPF, Policy D6 of the London Plan and Policy DMH 5 of the Hillingdon Local Plan : P",
    "The proposed development would result in the creation of a 7 bedroom HMO with 2 off road vehicular parking spaces. No robust travel plan or transport assessment, has been submitted detailing how the significant parking shortfall or increased vehicular trip generation would impact on the local highways network. As a result the applicant has failed to demonstrate the proposed development would have no adverse impact on the local highways network or its users. Furthermore the proposed parking layout is awkward and contrived discouraging use of the spaces and endangering pedestrians and cars struggle to manouver in and out of the proposed parking spaces. The proposal is therefore considered to be contrary to Policies DMT 2, DMT 4 and DMT 6 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy T4 and T6 of the London Plan (2021) and paragraph 111 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan (2021) and national guidance."
