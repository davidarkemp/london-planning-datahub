    "The alterations to the shopfront by virtue of the proposed loss of the existing central corbel and pilaster and the proposed creme rendered finish to the shopfront and stall riser would neither preserve nor enhance the character and appearance of the Ruislip Village Conservation Area. As such the shop front appears as an incongruous addition to the detriment of the visual amenity of the street scene and the character and appearance of the wider Ruislip Village Conservation Area. The proposal is thus contrary to Policies BE1 and HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies BE4, BE13, BE15 and BE28 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Saved UDP Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 4, DMHB 11, DMHB 13 and Appendix B: Design Guidance for Shopfronts of the emerging Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies with Modifications (March 2019) and the Council's adopted Supplementary Planning Document HDAS: Shopfronts.",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant saved policies (referred to as policies from the Hillingdon Unitary Development Plan - Saved Policies September 2007), then London Plan Policies (2016).  On the 8th November 2012 Hillingdon's Full Council agreed the adoption of the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies. Appendix 5 of this explains which saved policies from the old Unitary Development (which was subject to a direction from Secretary of State in September 2007 agreeing that the policies were 'saved') still apply for development control decisions.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the 'Saved' UDP 2007, Local Plan Part 1, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service."
