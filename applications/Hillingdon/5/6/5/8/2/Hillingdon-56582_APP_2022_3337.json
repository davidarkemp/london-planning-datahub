  "description": "Raising of roof to provide habitable accommodation within loft space, to include a double hip to gable conversion, roof lights, front and rear dormers, and erection of a two-storey side/rear extension, rear patio and external alterations to property (Revised description, no changes to the submitted drawings)",
  "decision_date": "23/12/2022",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed raising of the roof, double hip to gable conversion, front dormers and two storey side/rear extension, by reason of their cumulative size, scale, bulk, height and design (including uncharacteristic roof profiles), would result in a disproportionate, visually obtrusive and top heavy form of development that would be detrimental to the appearance of the original host dwelling, and would cause harm to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the existing street scene and the setting of the adjoining Ickenham Village Conservation Area. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies HE1 and BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2021), Policies DMHD 1, DMHB 1, DMHB 4, DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management (2020), Policies D3, D4 and HC1 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The proposed development, by virtue of its proximity, depth, size, scale, bulk and height of the new proposed two-storey side gable wall, would have a harmful impact on the living conditions of the neighbouring occupiers at number 100 Long Lane and their associated private amenity space, in terms of outlook, overdominance, sense of enclosure and overbearing impact. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012), Policies DMHD 1 and DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The proposed development, by virtue of the proposed rear dormer window, would have a harmful impact on the living conditions of the neighbouring occupiers at number 4 Halford Road and their associated private amenity space, in terms of overlooking and loss of privacy. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012), Policies DMHD 1 and DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021)."
