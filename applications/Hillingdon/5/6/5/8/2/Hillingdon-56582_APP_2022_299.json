  "description": "Raising of roof to provide habitable accommodation within loft space, to include a double hip to gable conversion, and erection of a part two storey, part single storey side/rear extension, rear patio and external alterations to the property",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed raising of the roof, double hip gable conversion and part two storey, part single storey side/rear extension, by reason of their cumulative size, scale, bulk, height and design (including uncharacteristic roof profiles), would result in an incongruous, disproportionate and cramped  form of development that would be detrimental to the appearance of the original host dwelling, and cause harm to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the  existing street scene and the setting of the adjoining Ickenham Village Conservation Area. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies HE1 and BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2021), Policies DMHD 1, DMHB 4, DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management (2020), Policies D1, D3, D4 and HC1 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The proposed part two storey, part single storey side/rear extension, by reason of its siting, size, scale, bulk, and proximity to the side boundary, would result in a closing of the visually open gap at first floor level between it and the mutual boundary shared with number 4 Halford Road, giving rise to a cramped form of development and setting a precedent for a possible terracing effect, which would be detrimental to the visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area, including the setting of the adjoining Ickenham Village Conservation Area. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies HE1 and BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2021), Policies DMHD 1, DMHB 4, DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management (2020), Policies D1, D3, D4 and HC1 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The proposed double hip to gable conversion and increase to the main ridge height of the host dwelling would result in an unduly prominent, visually incongruous and top-heavy form of development that would be detrimental to the character, appearance and visual",
    "amenities of the existing street scene and the surrounding area, including the setting of the adjoining Ickenham Village Conservation Area. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies HE1 and BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2021), Policies DMHD 1, DMHB 4, DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management (2020), Policies D1, D3, D4 and HC1 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The proposed development, by virtue of its proximity, depth, size, scale, bulk and height, would have a harmful impact on the living conditions of the neighbouring occupiers at number 100 Long Lane and their associated private amenity space, in terms of outlook, overdominance, sense of enclosure and overbearing impact. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012), Policies DMHD 1 and DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The proposed development, by virtue of the first floor bedrooms being served by roof lights and not being afforded with any direct outlook, would result in a substandard form of internal residential accommodation to the detriment of the amenity of occupants of the host property at number 2 Halford Road. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policy DMHB 16 of Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The proposed development, by virtue of its failure to maintain an adequate provision of private external amenity space, would have a harmful effect on the living conditions of the occupants of the host property at number 2 Halford Road. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policies DMHB 18 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "a) We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal.",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2016). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020."
