    "This semi-mature Oak tree is situated next to Symphony House, on the northwestern corner. This tree does not appear to have been pruned (reduced) before and, as a result, it has retained an attractive, natural looking crown. This semi-mature Oak tree has a moderate amenity value - making a good contribution to the visual amenity and arboreal character of the local area.",
    "No reasons have been provided which justify the level of pruning which is proposed. These works would unnecessarily introduce multiple wounds into the crown of these trees which would likely lead to infection. Additionally, the proposed work would reduce the size and amenity value of this tree and would also be detrimental to the natural balance and appearance of the tree.",
    "The compact and columnar habit of this tree would also mean that its appearance would be even more unsightly as a result of carrying out a crown reduction.",
