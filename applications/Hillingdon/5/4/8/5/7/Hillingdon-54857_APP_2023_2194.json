    "The proposed single storey side and front extension, by reason of its siting in a visually prominent position, size and scale would result in incongruous and insubordinate form of development. Furthermore it would result in the loss of openness on the corner plot, resulting in a cramped appearance. The proposal would therefore be an unsympathetic addition and represent an overdevelopment of the site, to the detriment of the character, appearance and visual amenities of the surrounding area. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHD 1, DMHB 1, DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",

We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service."
