    "The proposed development refers to the erection of an outbuilding that is proposed to be used in connection with the recently approved flats under reference 54817/APP/2022/2568 (appeal reference APP/R5510/W/23/3326327). At the time the application was determined, the approved flats had not been substantially completed. The application site address refers to Land Adjacent to 1A Nicholls Avenue, which is currently a vacant plot of land. As such, a condition to restrict the outbuilding with the residential use of the non-existent flats would not be enforceable or precise. The development would, therefore, conflict with the requirements of Paragraph 56 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023).",
    "The proposed development, by reason of its location, independent access, design, and proposed landscaping, is considered capable of independent occupation. As a result, the proposal would be tantamount to a separate self-contained residential unit in a position where such a dwelling would be unacceptable. The proposal is, therefore, contrary to Chapter 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023), Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021), and Policies DMHD 2 and DMHB 11 of the  Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "In the absence of accurately scaled floor plans and elevation plans, it cannot be determined the level of internal living accommodation for future occupiers. The proposal is, therefore, contrary to Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021) and Policy DMHB 16 of the  Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan (2021) and national guidance."
