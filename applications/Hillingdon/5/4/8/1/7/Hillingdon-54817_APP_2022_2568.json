    "Due to its design, depth, bulk and scale, the resulting building, including its roof, would form an oversized, uncharacteristic and visually incongruous form of development which would fail to harmonise with the established character of the area and appearance of the street scene and locality. The proposal would therefore be detrimental to the visual amenities of the streetscene and the character and appearance of the surrounding area, all contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012), Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policies D1 and D3 of the London Plan (2021) and paragraphs 130 (a) and (c) of the NPPF (2021).",
    "The proposed first floor side elevation bedroom window facing No.1a at Nicholls Avenue would lead to an unacceptable loss of privacy to users of the space, adversely impacting on the amenities of the occupiers of the property. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policy DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020) and paragraph 130 (f) of the NPPF (2021).",
    "The proposal includes no provision of family sized residential units (3 bedrooms or more) nor justification as to why such units cannot be included in the proposed development. The proposal therefore consists of a unsuitable housing mix contrary to Policies DMH 2 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy H10 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The proposed development includes an over provision of vehicle parking and therefore fails to promote sustainable forms of transportation. The proposed additional vehicle crossover would endanger pedestrians crossing the site as well as vehicle users entering and exiting the site. Insufficient electrical vehicle charging points would be provided for the proposed development. For these reasons, the proposal would be contrary to Policies DMT 2 and DMT 6 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020) and Policy T4 and T6 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan (2021) and national guidance.",
    "This is a reminder that Under the terms of the Planning Act 2008 (as amended) and Community Infrastructure Levy Regulations 2010 (as amended), should an application for appeal be allowed, the proposed development would be deemed as 'chargeable development' and therefore liable to pay the London Borough of Hillingdon Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and the Mayor of London's Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This would be calculated in accordance with the London Borough of Hillingdon CIL Charging Schedule 2014 and the Mayor of London's CIL Charging Schedule 2012.",
