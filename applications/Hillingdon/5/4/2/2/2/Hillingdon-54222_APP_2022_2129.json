    "The design and appearance of the porch due to its excessive scale and unacceptable materials, fails to read as a subordinate and visually sympathetic addition to the application dwelling. As a result the development harms the character and appearance of the application property, the pair of semi-detached dwellings of which it forms a part, the visual amenity of the street scene and fails to preserve or enhance the character and appearance of the Ickenham Village Conservation Area. This less than substantial harm to the conservation area would not be outweighed by any identified public benefits. Therefore the application is contrary to HE1 and BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One Strategic (2012) and Policies DMHB1, DMHB 4, DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policies D3 and HC1 of the London Plan (2021) and Chapters 12 and 16 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021) and refused.",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2016). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020."
