    "The swamp cypress can be seen over the properties within Fringewood Close, and from within Ruislip Woods National Nature Reserve (NNR) and as a result, has a high amenity value. It significantly contributes to the public amenity and arboreal character of the area. It is situated just outside the Copse Wood Estate and contributes to the gradual transition of mature tree cover between dwellings and the nearby Ruislip woods NNR.",
    "Our inspection suggests that the swamp cypress does not have a low live crown ratio as described in the report. The tree shows a significant portion of its height covered by healthy, live foliage, indicating a more robust structure than reported.",
    "While the tree does bifurcate into a co-dominant stem at 17-18 meters, it should be noted that the condition and stability of the co-dominant union could not be fully established from a ground-level inspection. The visible branch unions above the bifurcation appeared stable. No evidence for a structurally weak union ha",
    "The removal of deadwood, dangerous / hanging branches and ivy:  This does not require the formal consent of the Council.",
    "Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981:  Note that it is an offence under this act to disturb roosting bats, nesting birds or any other protected species.  Therefore, if applicable, it is advisable to consult your tree surgeon / consultant to agree an acceptable time for carrying out the approved works.",
    "Owner(s)'s permission:  Permission should be sought from the owner(s) of the tree(s) and / or the owner(s) of the land that the tree(s) overhang prior to any approved work being carried out.",
    "Expected standard of tree work: The approved works must be carried out in accordance with the conditions laid out above. If they are not, then enforcement action could being taken which could lead to prosecution and heavy fines. Therefore, it is highly recommended that the works are only carried out by a professional and competent arboriculturist who undertakes to comply with the conditions of this consent and in accordance with industry best practice (BS 3998:2010). The Arboricultural Association can provide details of its approved contractors, who have demonstrated such professionalism and competence, on their website (www.trees.org.uk) or by calling 01242 522152. Or on request the Council can provide a list of contractors who are known to carry out tree work to a good standard and to normally maintain an appropriate policy of indemnity insurance."
