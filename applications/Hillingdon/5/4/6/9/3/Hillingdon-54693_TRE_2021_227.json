    "The tree can be seen over the properties within Fringewood Close and from within Ruislip Woods National Nature Reserve (NNR) as a result it has a high amenity value. It significantly contributes to the public amenity and arboreal character of the area. It is situated just outside the Copse Wood Estate and contributes to the gradual transition of mature tree cover between dwellings and the nearby Ruislip woods NNR.",
    "The supplied arboricultural report does not provide a conclusive reason as to why the branch failure has occurred. It is noted that the inspection carried out was from the ground and it might be worth completing a further aerial inspection of the tree to check the remaining crown. On balance the visual amenity of this tree is seen to currently outweigh the reasons for removal.",
    "Having regard to the reasons given for the proposed work, the work is unjustified and will have a detrimental impact on the visual amenity and arboreal character of the area.",
    "The removal of deadwood, dangerous / hanging branches and ivy:  This does not require the formal consent of the Council."
