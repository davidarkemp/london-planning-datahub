    "The proposed development, by reason of its siting and layout would result in a development of the site, which would fail to harmonise with the existing local and historic context of the surrounding area. The principle of intensifying the residential use of the site to the level proposed, as well as the proposed loss of existing private rear garden area would have a detrimental impact on the character and appearance of the area as a whole. The proposal is therefore detrimental to the visual amenity and character of the surrounding area and contrary to Policies DMH 6 and DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021), and paragraphs 126 and 130 of the NPPF (2021).",
    "The proposal fails to demonstrate that the floor to ceiling height of each of the proposed dwellings would be a minimum of 2.5m high, throughout 75% of each property. The proposal is therefore considered to create an unsatisfactory and poor level of living accommodation for future residents, contrary to Policy D6 (8) of the London Plan (2021).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan - The Spatial Development Strategy for London consolidated with alterations since 2011 (2016) and national guidance.",
    "This is a reminder that Under the terms of the Planning Act 2008 (as amended) and Community Infrastructure Levy Regulations 2010 (as amended), should an application for appeal be allowed, the proposed development would be deemed as 'chargeable development' and therefore liable to pay the London Borough of Hillingdon Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and the Mayor of London's Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This would be calculated in accordance with the London Borough of Hillingdon CIL Charging Schedule 2014 and the Mayor of London's CIL Charging Schedule 2012.",
