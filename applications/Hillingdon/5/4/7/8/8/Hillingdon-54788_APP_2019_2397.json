    "The roof alteration/extensions, by reason of the siting in this visually open prominent position, size, scale, bulk and design of the rear dormer would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original dwelling and would be detrimental to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the street scene and the Gatehill Farm Estate, Northwood Area of Special Local Character. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policy BE1 and HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies BE5, BE13, BE15 and BE19 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Unitary Development Plan Saved Policies (November 2012) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document HDAS: Residential Extensions.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the 'Saved' UDP 2007, Local Plan Part 1, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "The existing property has a kick to the roof at the eaves (sprocketed eaves) and this has not been depicted in the drawings for the existing property. This is often not depicted in plans for ease of drawing. However, it is an early key feature in the area and desirable to retain. No request seems to have been made for a change to this aspect of the roof form, but given the amount of work being proposed to the roof this feature may be in danger of being ignored. This eaves detail should be retained and carried through to the proposed roof form to match the existing."
