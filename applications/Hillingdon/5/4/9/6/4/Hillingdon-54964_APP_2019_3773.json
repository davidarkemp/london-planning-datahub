No samples have been submitted to the Council. Additionally the schedule of materials on the submitted plans differ from that stated within the application form. As such insufficient information has been submitted and the proposal is thus contrary to Policy DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020)."
