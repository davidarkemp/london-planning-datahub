    "Approved - To reduce Leylandii by 3 metres from top and sides, cut back from building & tidy. (T1 within A1 on TPO 160) to front.",
    "Fell one conifer tree adjacent to Leylandii (T2 within A1 on TPO 160)",
    "Crown reduction and/or crown reshaping:  Involves the overall reduction of the height and spread of a tree's crown, whilst, as far as possible, retaining its natural shape. It is advisable to retain smaller branches close to the pruning wounds to aid in the drawing up of water to the wounded tissue.",
    "Pruning:  The branches on (T1 Leyland Cypress) should be cut back from the building to suitable growth points such as a side branch or outward facing bud.  The retained bud or branch ought to be at least one third of the diameter of the removed limb, to reduce the likelihood of dieback occuring and to maintain a flowing branch line.",
    "Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981:  Note that it is an offence under this act to disturb roosting bats, nesting birds or any other protected species.  Therefore, if applicable, it is advisable to consult your tree surgeon / consultant to agree an acceptable time for carrying out the approved works.",
    "Stump removal: After felling, tree stumps are frequently colonised by honey fungus (Armillaria sp.) which is known to spread and colonise nearby trees. Some trees and woody plants can often be killed by honey fungus and, therefore, it is advisable to remove the tree stump and roots as soon as possible after felling.",
    "Expected standard of tree work: The approved works must be carried out in accordance with the conditions laid out above. If they are not, then enforcement action could being taken which could lead to prosecution and heavy fines. Therefore, it is highly recommended that the works are only carried out by a professional and competent arboriculturist who undertakes to comply with the conditions of this consent and in accordance with industry best practice (BS 3998:2010). The Arboricultural Association can provide details of its approved contractors, who have demonstrated such professionalism and competence, on their website (www.trees.org.uk) or by calling 01242 522152. Or on request the Council can provide a list of contractors who are known to carry out tree work to a good standard and to normally maintain an appropriate policy of indemnity insurance.",
    "The tree(s) to be pruned shall be crown reduced as per the approved specification / by a maximum of 3m. This work shall comprise a reduction in both height and spread over the whole crown by shortening or removing peripheral branches in a uniform and systematic manner.  Where branches are shortened, they should be cut back to a suitably positioned secondary branch.",
    "Crown reduction shall not be construed as 'lopping' or 'topping' and shall result in a tree of typical form for the species and of balanced appearance. The works shall be carried out in accordance with the recommendations contained in BS 3998:2010 'Tree work - Recommendations'. Climbing irons or 'spikes' shall not be used during the execution of the work.",
    "REASON",
    "In order to protect health of the tree and the visual amenity of the area.",
    "No felling shall take place until such time as a scheme has been submitted to, and approved in writing by, the Local Planning Authority for a replacement tree(s), which shall be of 'Standard' size (about 2-3m high) and short-staked for support. The replacement tree shall be planted during the first planting season following the felling works hereby permitted. Thereafter, the replacement tree(s) shall be retained indefinitely and maintained (watered and weeded during the spring and summer) for 2-3 years, or until established.",
    "REASON",
    "In order to comply with the requirements of Section 206 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990.",
    "Refused  - T3  Fell 3 x small conifer trees to ground level (within A1 on TPO 160).",
    "T4 Fell Lawson Cypress to ground level (within A1 on TPO 160).",
    "The removal of deadwood, dangerous / hanging branches and ivy: This does not require the formal consent of the Council.",
    "The group of Lawson Cypresses (T3 on plan within A1 on TPO 160) and the other Lawson Cypress (T4 on plan within A1) have a lower amenity value, but are more visible to neighbouring properties.",
    "With regard to the proposed felling of all of these trees, the reasons provided are not considered to be justified reasons for felling these trees. The 3 Lawson Cypresses on the western boundary are not in particularly poor condition and still retain a good amount of live foliage. The ivy is extensive on a section of trunk on T4, however, this can be removed from the trunk and the rest of the tree is still alive.",
    "Conclusion: Having regard to the reasons given for removing these four trees, the works are not considered to be justified with the reasons provided in the application.",
    "Refusal of part of the requested works: The applicant retains a right of appeal against the part of the application that has effectively been refused To fell four Lawson Cypresses T3 & T4 on plan with A1 on TPO 160).",
