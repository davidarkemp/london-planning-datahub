    "The proposed rear extension, by virtue of its excessive size, width, bulk, depth, massing and proximity to the neighbouring boundary, would be detrimental to the amenities of the neighbouring occupiers at 39 Clivesdale Drive, by reason of the overbearing scale of the extension, overshadowing, visual intrusion and loss of outlook. Therefore, the proposal would be contrary to Policies BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012), Policies DMHD 1 and DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and Policies D4 and D6 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination)."
