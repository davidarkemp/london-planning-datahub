    "To fell one Ash within Area 2 in TPO 5",
    "No felling shall take place until such time as a scheme has been submitted to, and approved in writing by, the Local Planning Authority for a replacement tree, which shall be of 'Standard' size (about 2-3m high) and short-staked for support. The replacement tree shall be planted during the first planting season following the felling works hereby permitted. Thereafter, the replacement tree shall be retained indefinitely and maintained (watered and weeded during the spring and summer) for 2-3 years, or until established.",
    "REASON",
    "In order to comply with the requirements of Section 206 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990.",
    "The works hereby permitted shall be carried out within 2 years of the date of this consent.",
    "REASON",
    "To enable the Local Planning Authority to reconsider the appropriateness of the works in the light of any change in circumstances.",
    "To prune two Scots Pines T109 and T110 in TPO 5",
    "The removal of deadwood, dangerous / hanging branches and ivy:  This does not require the formal consent of the Council.",
    "Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981:  Note that it is an offence under this act to disturb roosting bats, nesting birds or any other protected species.  Therefore, if applicable, it is advisable to consult your tree surgeon / consultant to agree an acceptable time for carrying out the approved works.",
    "Refusal of part of the requested works: The applicant retains a right of appeal against the part of the application that has effectively been refused.",
    "The Ash is located at the bottom of the rear garden of 38 Court Road and has a large and developed crown, which is partially visible from the road. The tree has a moderate amenity value.",
    "This Ash presents a large cavity at the base of the trunk which appears to be progressing and has the potential to make the tree unstable and hazardous. There is no objection to the removal of the tree.",
    "Having regard to the proposed works on the Ash, the work is justified and will not have a detrimental impact on the visual amenity or arboreal character of the local area.",
    "The two Scots Pines are located within the back garden of 36 Court Road. The trees present mature, thick and aesthetically attractive crowns and form a significant landscape feature with a moderate-to-high amenity value. The trees also greatly contribute to local biodiversity.",
    "The crowns of these Scots Pines have responded to light demands by developing more branches to one side, but appear healthy and attractive. Pruning would in",
    "Replacement tree: The replacement tree will require basic maintenance (watering and weeding during spring and summer) for approximately 2-3 years to encourage successful establishment.",
    "Expected standard of tree work: The approved works must be carried out in accordance with the conditions laid out above. If they are not, then enforcement action could being taken which could lead to prosecution and heavy fines. Therefore, it is highly recommended that the works are only carried out by a professional and competent arboriculturist who undertakes to comply with the conditions of this consent and in accordance with industry best practice (BS 3998:2010). The Arboricultural Association can provide details of its approved contractors, who have demonstrated such professionalism and competence, on their website (www.trees.org.uk) or by calling 01242 522152. Or on request the Council can provide a list of contractors who are known to carry out tree work to a good standard and to normally maintain an appropriate policy of indemnity insurance."
