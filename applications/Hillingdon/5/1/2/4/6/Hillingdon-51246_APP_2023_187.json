    "The proposed roof extension, side extension and rear extension, by reason of their  design, scale, size, bulk and massing, both individually and cumulatively, would appear as disproportionate and incongruous additions that would fail to respect the original roof form and architectural composition of the original dwelling, and would be detrimental to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the surrounding area. The proposal would therefore be contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020) and Policy D4 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "The proposed rear extension by reason of its size, scale, bulk, height, massing and proximity would have a harmful impact on the living conditions of Nos 156 and 152 Hoylake Crescent and their private amenity space, through loss of light, outlook and its overbearing impact. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHD 1 and DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020)."
