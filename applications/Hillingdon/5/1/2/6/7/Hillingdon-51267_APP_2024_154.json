  "decision_conditions": [
    "Condition 12 of planning permission ref 48612/G/98/2348, dated 01-09-1999, shall be reworded to read as follows:",
    "'When the premises are occupied by a toy retailer, toys, children's sports goods and equipment, wheeled goods and associated equipment, play equipment, baby equipment and associated accessories, electronic games and equipment and other products associated with toys and children's entertainment may be sold from the premises. Otherwise the premises shall be used primarily for the sale of non-food bulky goods, together with associated and ancillary products (sales of the latter accounting for no more than 20% of the total sales at the premises) and for no other purpose. Upon the reasonable request of the Local Planning Authority, the occupants of the unit shall provide a written breakdown of sales in sufficient detail to allow verification of compliance with this condition.'",
    "REASON",
    "To ensure that the sale of non bulky, non food goods remains a minor part of the use at this",
    "Notwithstanding Condition 12, the development shall otherwise be carried out, retained, and maintained in compliance with all other approved details and conditions.",
    "The decision to GRANT planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to GRANT planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan (2021) and NPPF (2023).",
    "The Equality Act 2010 seeks to protect people accessing goods, facilities and services from discrimination on the basis of a 'protected characteristic', which includes those with a disability. As part of the Act, service providers are obliged to improve access to and within the structure of their building, particularly in situations where reasonable adjustment can be incorporated with relative ease. The Act states that service providers should think ahead to take steps to address barriers that impede disabled people."
