    "The mature Willow tree is situated in the rear garden of the property. It is in good condition and can be seen by surrounding neighbours.",
    "The tree has a secondary limb that is the concern of this application, however removing a large amount of this could cause the limb to be shut off from the crown and die. This could lead to an imbalance in the crown. The limb is currently part of the biomechanics of the trees system.",
    "This application is refused as there is no evidence to suggest reducing this limb would be beneficial to the tree."
