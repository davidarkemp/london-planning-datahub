    "The proposed side and rear dormer, by reason of size, height, roof form and design would result in an incongruous addition which would would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original dwelling, and would also fail to harmonise with the established local context, having a harmful visual impact on the character and appearance of the Ruislip Village Conservation Area and wider area. It would fail to either preserve or enhance the character of the conservation area, and there are no public benefits that would outweigh the identified less than substantial harm. The proposal would therefore be contrary Policies BE1 and HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012), Policies DMHB 1, DMHB 4, and DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two- Development Management Policies (2020), Policies HC1, D3, and D4 of the London Plan (2021) and Paragraphs 124, 130, 197, 199, 202 and 203 of the NPPF (2021) and Section 72 of the Planning (Listed Building",
    "The proposed side and rear dormers, by virtue of its proximity, would be detrimental to the amenities of the adjoining occupiers at No.44 Wood Lane, and Nos. 65 and 65A Kingsend by reason of visual intrusion, overbearing nature, overlooking and loss of privacy. Therefore, the proposal would be contrary to policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020)."
