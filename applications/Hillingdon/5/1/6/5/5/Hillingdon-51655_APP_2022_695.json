    "The proposed single storey rear extension by reason of the cumulative size, scale and bulk would result in a disproportionate and incongruous form of development that would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original dwelling, and would be detrimental to the appearance of the original host dwelling, and cause harm to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the existing street scene.  The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012), Policies DMHD1, DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policies D1, D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The proposed single storey rear extension, by virtue of its siting, combined height, width and in particular depth, bulk and massing would result in overbearing impact visual intrusion and loss of outlook to the occupiers at at No.3 and No. 7 Clovelly Avenue. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012) and Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020)."
