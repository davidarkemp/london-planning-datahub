  "description": "To fell One Oak, within Group 17 on TPO 24.",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The Oak tree is situated to the rear of 3 Blacklands Drive's back garden. It can be seen from neighbouring properties as well as over the houses to the front. As a result it has a Moderate amenity value. It significantly contributes to the arboricultural character of the local area and has the potential for a long life.",
    "The applicant alleges that the tree is the cause of damage to the outbuilding however they have not provided any supporting evidence to colaborate this claim. It is noted that there is a active application (currently) proposing to remove the current outbuilding and rebuild (51464/APP/2020/3210). There are a few tips of branches touching the roof of the outbuilding, the cutting back of these to create a gap of upto 1m can be completed under an exemption to abate a nuisance. The complete removal of this oak would have a significant impact on the arboricultural character of the area and set an undesirable presedence for the removal of mature trees. The applicant suggests",
    "The removal of deadwood, dangerous / hanging branches and ivy:  This does not require the formal consent of the Council.",
    "There are a few tips of branches touching the roof of the outbuilding, the cutting back of these to create a gap of upto 1m can be completed under an exemption to abate a nuisance."
