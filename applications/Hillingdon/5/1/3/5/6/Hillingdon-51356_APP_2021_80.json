  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed development, by virtue of its siting, size, scale and design, including the lack of a set back from the front at all levels, width of side extension and depth of the first floor rear extension, would fail to appear as a subordinate addition and would thus fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original semi-detached dwelling, would be detrimental to the character, appearance and symmetry of the pair of semi-detached houses of which it forms a part and to the visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon  of the Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The proposed extensions by virtue of its size, scale, layout and the existence of an independent access, would be tantamount to the creation of a self contained separate dwelling, where such a dwelling would not be acceptable due to its impact on the character and appearance of the host dwelling and the wider locality, the need for additional parking and amenity space and issues relating to impact on the existing and adjoining dwellings. The proposal is therefore contrary to policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12, DMHB 16, DMHB 18 and DMT 6 of the Hillingdon  of the Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and Policies D6, T6 and T6.1 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2021). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020."
