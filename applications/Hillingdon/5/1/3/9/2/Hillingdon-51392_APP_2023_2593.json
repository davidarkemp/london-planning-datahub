    "Due to its adverse impact on protected trees, poor design, excessive height and bulk in a backland location, the new residential building would cause less than substantial harm to the conservation area, harm to the setting of the nearby locally listed buildings and harm to the general character and appearance of the area. The less than substantial harm caused to the Conservation Area is not outweighed by public benefits. The proposal is considered to be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies, Policies DMH 6, DMHB 1, DMHB 4, DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policies HC1, D1, D3 and D6 of the London Plan (2021), as well as paragraphs 71, 124,130, 197, 199, 202 and 203 of the NPPF (2021).",
    "Flat 4 within the converted Bakehouse would have a first floor bedroom window providing views toward the rear elevation windows and gardens of No's 10, 12, 14, 14a, 16, and 16a The Green. Due to the position of the window and its close proximity to the mentioned neighbouring properties, the proposed development would cause excessive overlooking and a significant loss of privacy to the detriment of those neighbours amenities and living conditions. The proposal is therefore considered to be contrary to Policies DMH 6 and DMHB 11, of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021), and paragraph 130 (f) of the NPPF (2021).",
    "The proposed development, on account of the intervisibility between habitable room windows serving flats 3 and 4, would result in poor levels of privacy to the occupiers of both units to the detriment of their amenities and contrary to Policy Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021) and paragraph 130 (f) of the NPPF (2021).",
    "No legal agreement is in place to prohibit future residents of the proposed development from applying for parking permits. In the absence of a satisfactory legal agreement, future residents could apply for parking permits, which would undermine planning policy which seeks to promote car free development and sustainable forms of transportation and add to pressure on on-street parking in the vicinity of the site. Consequently, the proposal would be contrary to Policy DMT 2 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020) and Policy T4 and T6 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan - The Spatial Development Strategy for London consolidated with alterations since 2011 (2016) and national guidance.",
    "This is a reminder that Under the terms of the Planning Act 2008 (as amended) and Community Infrastructure Levy Regulations 2010 (as amended), should an application for appeal be allowed, the proposed development would be deemed as 'chargeable development' and therefore liable to pay the London Borough of Hillingdon Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and the Mayor of London's Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This would be calculated in accordance with the London Borough of Hillingdon CIL Charging Schedule 2014 and the Mayor of London's CIL Charging Schedule 2012.",
