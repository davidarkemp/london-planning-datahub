    "The application site is located within an area of high flood risk where inappropriate development should be avoided by directing development away from areas at highest risk. The applicant has failed to demonstrate that the residential development could not be provided on a suitable sequentially preferable and reasonably available site at a lower risk of flooding. The proposal fails the sequential test and fails to accord with the Paragraphs 159, 161 and 162 of the NPPF (2021), Planning Practice Guidance; Flood Risk and Coastal Change March 2014, London Plan Policy SI 12 (2021); Policy EM6 of the Local Plan: Part 1 (2012), and Policy DMEI 9 of the Local Plan: Part 2 (2020).",
    "Due to its depth, bulk, scale, massing, design and siting, the proposed building would form an oversized, uncharacteristic and visually incongruous form of development, which would fail to harmonise with the established character and appearance of the street scene and the adjoining Eastcote Village Conservation Area. The proposal would therefore be detrimental to the visual amenities of the street scene and character of the surrounding area, all contrary to Policies HE1 and BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012), Policies DMHB 1, DMHB 4, DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policies HC1, D1 and D3 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "Due to its depth, size, siting and design, the proposed building would be overbearing and would lead to a harmful sense of enclosure and loss of outlook from the windows and gardens of 31 and 30 Deerings Drive and  292 Joel Street, as well as significant overlooking and a harmful loss of privacy to the adjoining occupiers. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policy DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and paragraph 130 (f) of the NPPF (2021).",
    "The proposed development fails to provide any three or more bedroom (family sized) units. Robust justification has not been provided to demonstrate that the provision of family sized units would be unsuitable or unviable. The proposal therefore fails to optimise the site and provide a suitable mix of housing to support sustainable, inclusive and mixed communities, contrary to Policy DMH 2 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy H10 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The proposed development fails to provide sufficient on-plot car parking thereby potentially leading to undue displaced on-street parking to the detriment of parking capacity and safety on the public highway, contrary to Local Plan: Part 2 Development Plan (2020) Policies DMT 1, DMT 2 & DMT 6 and Policies T4 and T6 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "The proposal would fail to provide satisfactory living conditions for future residents of the block itself, by reason of lack of private and communal external amenity space (gardens/balconies), adequate defensible space and a poor outlook for the proposed ground floor and fourth floor units, contrary to  Policies DMHB 15 and DMHB 18 of the Hillingdon Part 2 Local Development Plan (2020).",
    "The scheme has failed to make a policy compliant contribution to affordable housing, or demonstrate that the maximum level of affordable housing can be provided on the site. The submitted Financial Viability Assessment has been assessed by the Council's external consultants, who disagree with the assessor's approach to the Benchmark Land Value. The lack of provision of affordable housing fails to promote social cohesion and mixed communities and fails to ensure that there is a steady supply of lower-rent flats within the borough, or provide discounted home ownership options. This is contrary to London Plan Policies H4 and H5, Policy H2 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies (2012), Policy DMH 7 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020),  and the provisions of the NPPF.",
    "The site lies within Flood Zone 3a, which is an area having a high probability of flooding. The applicant has failed to adequately assess the development's flood risk. In particular, the application fails to demonstrate that adequate flood storage compensation will be provided on both a level for level and volume for volume basis. Therefore, the proposed development is expected to impede flood flow and reduce flood storage capacity, thus causing a net loss in floodplain storage and increasing the risk of flooding elsewhere. In addition, the application has not sufficiently demonstrated the use of the London Plan's drainage hierarchy. The proposal therefore fails to accord with Paragraphs 159 and 169 of the NPPF (2021), London Plan Policies  SI 12 and SI 13; Policy EM6 of the Local Plan: Part 1 (2012), Policies DMEI 9 and  DMEI 10 of the Local Plan: Part 2 (2020). and Planning Practice Guidance; Flood Risk and Coastal Change March 2014,",
    "The proposal fails to achieve acceptable standards of accessible and inclusive design. In particular, the submitted ground floor plan indicates a stepped approach to the ground floor flats and lift lobby from the principal communal entrance. Furthermore the side entrance ramp appears incongruous with the design and would result in an internal layout that is incompatible with the specifications for wheelchair adaptable accommodation, contrary to Policies D5, D7 and D12 of the London Plan and Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Strategic Policies",
    "The applicant has failed to provide contributions towards the improvement of services and facilities as a consequence of demands created by the proposed development (in respect of provision of affordable housing, a carbon offset contribution, a public open space contribution and Project Management and Monitoring). The scheme therefore conflicts with Policy, DMCI 7 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 Development Management Policies (2020), the London Borough of Hillingdon Supplementary Planning Document on Planning Obligations, Policy DF1 of the London Plan and the NPPF.",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan - The Spatial Development Strategy for London consolidated with alterations since 2011 (2016) and national guidance.",
    "You are advised that hard the Local Planning Authority not refused permission for the above reasons, and had the development been considered acceptable in other regards, it would have required that the applicant enter into a legal agreement to secure planning obligations set out within the Report and Addendum presented to the Major Applications Planning Committee.",
    "The Local Planning Authority has taken into consideration the requirements of the National Planning Policy Framework and has worked pro-actively with the applicant through extensive negotiations to address material planning issues wherever possible. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (Nov 2012), Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020); Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Site Allocations and Designations (2020), The London Plan (2021) and Supplementary Planning Guidance, and all relevant material considerations,",
    "including the NPPF and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service. Notwithstanding these discussions, the scheme was ultimately considered to fail to comply with the development plan for the reasons identified above.",
    "This is a reminder that Under the terms of the Planning Act 2008 (as amended) and Community Infrastructure Levy Regulations 2010 (as amended), should an application for appeal be allowed, the proposed development would be deemed as 'chargeable development' and therefore liable to pay the London Borough of Hillingdon Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and the Mayor of London's Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This would be calculated in accordance with the London Borough of Hillingdon CIL Charging Schedule 2014 and the Mayor of London's CIL Charging Schedule 2012.",
