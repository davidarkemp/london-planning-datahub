    "The proposed development by reason of its size, scale, bulk, massing and design would result in an incongruous and visually intrusive form of development that would fail to appear subordinate  to the existing dwellinghouse and the works would fail to respect the architectural composition of the existing dwellinghouse. The proposed development would also fail to harmonise with the established built environment on Thornhill Road resulting in a detrimental impact on the character and appearance of Blaydon Close. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012), Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two- Development Management Policies (2020) and Chapter 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023).",
    "The proposed development, by reason of its bulk, mass and height, in particular the two-storey front projection and proximity would result in an overly dominant feature that overshadows the adjoining property at No. 17 Thornhill Road resulting in loss of light, overdominance, overshadowing, visual intrusion and loss of outlook. and as such would result in a visually intrusive and an un-neighbourly form of development, resulting in a loss of light and material loss of residential amenity. Therefore, the proposal would be contrary to Policies DMHB11 and DMHD1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan - Part Two (2020).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service. We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
