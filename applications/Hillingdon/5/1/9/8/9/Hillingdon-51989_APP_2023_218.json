    "The proposed first floor side and rear wraparound extension, by reason of its cumulative size, scale, bulk,  and prominent siting, particularly within Milton Close, would fail to appear as a subordinate addition and would thus be detrimental to the appearance and architectural integrity of the host dwelling, and would unbalance this pair of semi-detached dwellings which would be detrimental to the visual amenities, character and appearance of the street scene and the wider area. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB11, DMHB12 and DMHD1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan - Part Two (2020) and Policies D4 and D8 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
