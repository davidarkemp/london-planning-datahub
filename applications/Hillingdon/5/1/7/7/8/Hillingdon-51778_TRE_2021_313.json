    "This Oak is situated within the rear garden of 3A Eastbury Avenue, near the boundary with the public road of Little Stream Close. The tree has a high-to-very high amenity value and is a significant and important landscape feature for those living within Little Stream Close and Eastbury Avenue. The tree contributes to the local biodiversity, and, for the species characteristics, has a significant wildlife value, acting as a host for a wide arrange of species. The benefit in amenity and biodiversity afforded by the tree is both present and future because it has the potential for long life expectancy.",
    "The applicant is seeking consent to fell and poison this Oak, as the tree is allegedly causing subsidence damage to property 5 Eastbury Avenue. The information and the scientific and technical evidence provided have been appraised. Two points have been noted in the documents provided, based on which the removal of this high-amenity tree is deemed unjustified; the level of damage to the prop",
