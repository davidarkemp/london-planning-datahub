    "The proposed development fails to provide sufficient off street parking provision which meets the councils approved parking standards to service the proposed and existing dwellings. The development would therefore lead to additional on street parking to the detriment of public and highway safety and is therefore contrary to Policies DMT 2 and DMT 6 of the Hillngdon Local Plan : Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020)",
    "The proposal fails to provide amenity space of sufficient size and quality commensurate to the size and layout of the both the proposed dwelling and retained dwelling at 67 Bishops Road. As such the proposal would provide a substandard form of accommodation for future residents and is therefore contrary to Policies DMHB 11 and DMHB 18 of the the Hillngdon Local Plan : Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The proposed development, by virtue of the provision of a balcony/terrace at first floor level and its siting and proximity to adjoining premises, would be detrimental to the amenities of the adjoining occupiers, including the host dwelling, by reason of overlooking and loss of privacy. Therefore, the proposal would be contrary to Policies DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The proposed dwelling, by reason of its size, design and layout fails to provide a dwelling which meets the requirements of people with disabilities and would therefore give rise to a substandard form of living accommodation to the detriment of the amenity of future occupiers. The proposal is thus contrary to Policy DMHB 11 of the the Hillngdon Local Plan : Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and Policies D5 and D7 of the London Plan (2021).",

    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan - The Spatial Development Strategy for London consolidated with alterations since 2011 (2016) and national guidance.",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant saved policies (referred to as policies from the Hillingdon Unitary Development Plan - Saved Policies September 2007), then London Plan Policies (2016). On the 8th November 2012 Hillingdon's Full Council agreed the adoption of the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies. Appendix 5 of this explains which saved policies from the old Unitary Development (which was subject to a direction from Secretary of State in September 2007 agreeing that the policies were 'saved') still apply for development control decisions.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the 'Saved' UDP 2007, Local Plan Part 1, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service."
