    "In the absence of a comprehensive scheme, the development of this site in isolation would result in a piecemeal development that would fail to safeguard the satisfactory redevelopment of this strategic site 'B' as identified within Policy SA 5 of the Hillingdon Revised Proposed Submission Version of the Local Plan: Part Two - Site Allocations and Designations (2019).  The proposed development is therefore contrary to Policy H1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012); Policy BE14 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Saved UDP Policies (November 2012); and Emerging Policy SA 5 of the Hillingdon Revised Proposed Submission Version of the Local Plan: Part Two - Site Allocations and Designations (2019).",
    "The proposal fails to provide a mix of uses including the provision of employment generating floorspace and appropriate community infrastructure onsite required as part of a comprehensive scheme. The proposal is therefore considered to be contrary to Policy 2.17 of the London Plan (2016), Policy LE1 and LE2 the Local Plan: Part 2 - Saved UDP Policies (2012), Policy DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Revised Proposed Submission Version of the Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2019) and Policy SA 5 of the Hillingdon Revised Proposed Submission Version of the Local Plan: Part Two - Site Allocations and Designations (2019).",
    "The proposed development fails to provide maximum reasonable amount of affordable housing on site. The proposal is therefore contrary to Saved Policy R17 of the the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Saved UDP Policies (November 2012); Policy H2 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012); the London Borough of Hillingdon's Supplementary Planning Document on Planning Obligations and policies Policies 3.10 -3.13 of the London Plan (March 2016); and National Planning Policy Framework, Para. 62 -64 (2019) or the Mayor's Affordable Housing and Viability SPD 2017.",
    "The proposed development, by reason of its overall size, scale, bulk and detailed design would result in a disproportionately large, dominating and incongruous form of development, which represents an over-development of the site,  in particular the ten and eight storey blank elevations against the southern boundary which would be highly visible from Nestles Avenue which would fail to respect the pattern and scale of development in the immediate area. The proposal would be detrimental to the visual amenities of the street scene and the character and appearance of the wider area and the Botwell/Nestles Conservation Area, contrary to Policies 3.4 and  7.6 of the London Plan (2016), Policies BE1 and HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies BE4, BE13 and BE19 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Saved UDP Policies (November 2012); Policies DMHB 1, DMHB 2, DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHB 14 of the Hillingdon Revised Proposed Submission Version",
    "The proposed development, due to its footprint and site coverage would create a narrow corridor along the eastern boundary of the site and fails to provide sufficient landscaping along the eastern boundary. Moreover, the eastern boundary provides entrances to residential units on a secondary elevation which is hidden along this access road. The principal elevation, along the eastern boundary, fails to provide a sense of arrival for future occupants and results in a poor streetscape. The narrow eastern corridor fails to provide a safe, suitable and convenient access for future residents.  The proposal would fail to provide a sense of arrival and would be detrimental to the visual amenities of the street scene and character and appearance of the wider area, contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework, Policies BE13, BE14, BE19 and BE38 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Saved UDP Policies (November 2012); Policies DMHB 1, DMHB 2, DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHB 14 of the Hillingdo",
    "The development provides a high proportion of single aspect dwellings and dwellings with their sole aspect facing towards Strategic Industrial Land. The development fails to provide sufficient separation from the western boundary of the site to mitigate against a potential noise generating use on the neighbouring site and as such, the proposal fails to take responsibility for mitigating impacts from existing noise-generating activities or uses on the proposed new noise-sensitive residential development and thereby fails to provide a suitably high quality of residential amenity for future occupiers contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012); Policy OE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Saved UDP Policies (November 2012) and Policy 7.15 of the London Plan (2016) and Paragraph 182 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2019).",
    "The proposed development would lead to an increase in kerbside parking and the waiting of cars on the highway, due to the operation of the car park stacking system. The proposed development fails to provide sufficient usable and sustainable car parking provision for the proposed development and would therefore result in an increase in on-street car parking in an area where such parking is at a premium thereby leading to conditions which would be detrimental to the free flow of traffic and to highway and pedestrian safety. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies AM7 and AM14 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Saved UDP Policies (November 2012),  Policy DMT 6 of the Hillingdon Revised Proposed Submission Version of the Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2019) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document HDAS: Residential Layouts.",
    "The proposed development, by virtue of its layout, vehicular access, and servicing and delivery and refuse collection arrangements along Nestles Avenue, would compromise highway and pedestrian safety by virtue of the proposed vehicular access into the site and the servicing and delivery arrangements, giving rise to conditions prejudicial to the free flow of traffic and would be detrimental to highway and pedestrian safety.  The development is therefore contrary to Policy AM7 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Saved UDP Policies (November 2012), Policies DMT 2 and DMT 5 of the the Hillingdon Revised Proposed Submission Version of the Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2019), Policy 6.12 of the London Plan (2016) and Chapter 9 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2019).",
    "The proposed shared vehicular and pedestrian path contained within an undercroft fails to provide a manoeuvring distance of 6m in accordance with Manual for Streets Standards. The proposed layout gives rise to conditions prejudicial to future users of this development as future occupants are required to use the shared vehicular and pedestrian footpath to access the residential and commercial entrances, whilst navigating vehicular traffic. The proposal is contrary to Policy AM7 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Unitary Development Plan Saved Policies (November 2012), to Hillingdon's Adopted Parking Standards as set out in the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Unitary Development Plan Saved Policies (November 2012) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document HDAS: Residential Layouts.",
    "The proposed development fails to provide on site private and communal amenity and children's play space of a quantity and quality commensurate to the size and layout of the proposals. Furthermore, the communal amenity areas are situated directly outside habitable rooms and balconies which would result in overlooking from communal spaces into balconies and habitable rooms. Such an arrangement would be detrimental to the residential amenity of the future occupiers the proposal would provide a substandard form of accommodation for future residents contrary to Policies BE21 and BE23 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Saved UDP Policies (November 2012), Policy DMCI 4 of the Hillingdon Revised Proposed Submission Version of the Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2019) , the adopted Supplementary Planning Document HDAS: Residential Layouts and Policy 7.1 of the London Plan (2016).",
    "The proposed development, in the absence of a comprehensive surface drainage strategy fails to demonstrate suitable sustainable urban drainage systems have been utilised and it is therefore contrary to Policy DMEI 10 of the Hillingdon Revised Proposed Submission Version of the Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2019), Policies OE7 and OE8 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Saved UDP Policies (November 2012) and Policy 5.13 of the London Plan (2016).",
    "In the absence of a comprehensive Air Quality Assessment that considers the development's the cumulative impacts alongside other consented developments within the area and in the absence of an Air Quality Neutral Assessment, the proposal fails to demonstrate appropriate reductions in emissions to sustain compliance with and contribute towards meeting EU limit values and national air quality objectives for pollutants. The proposal could therefore lead to further deterioration of existing poor air quality contrary to Policy DMEI 14 of the Hillingdon Revised Proposed Submission Version of the Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2019) and Policy 7.14 of the London Plan (2016).",
    "The proposed development, in the absence of a Section 106 legal agreement fails to provide contributions towards the improvements of services and facilities as a consequence of demands created by the proposed development (in respect of children's play space, C02 emissions, public realm improvements, air quality, construction training, canal quiet way, public transport and affordable housing). Given that a legal agreement to address this issue has not at this stage been offered or secured, the proposal is considered to be contrary to Policy R17 of the the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Saved UDP Policies (November 2012), DMCI 7 of the Hillingdon Revised Proposed Submission Version of the Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2019) , Policy 3.6, 3.10, 3.13, 5.2 and 8.2 of the London Plan (2016) and the London Borough of Hillingdon's Supplementary Planning Document on Planning Obligations.",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant saved policies (referred to as policies from the Hillingdon Unitary Development Plan - Saved Policies November 2012), then London Plan Policies (2016).  On the 8th November 2012 Hillingdon's Full Council agreed the adoption of the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies. Appendix 5 of this explains which saved policies from the old Unitary Development (which was subject to a direction from Secretary of State in November 2012 agreeing that the policies were 'saved') still apply for development control decisions.",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Unitary Development Plan Saved Policies (September 2007) as incorporated into the Hillingdon Local Plan (2012) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan - The Spatial Development Strategy for London consolidated with alterations since 2011 (2016) and national guidance.",
    "Under the terms of the Planning Act 2008 (as amended) and Community Infrastructure Levy Regulations 2010 (as amended), should an application be allowed at appeal, the proposed development would be deemed as 'chargeable development' and therefore liable to pay the London Borough of Hillingdon Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and the Mayor of London's Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This would be calculated in accordance with the London Borough of Hillingdon CIL Charging Schedule 2014 and the Mayor of London's CIL Charging Schedule 2012. For more information on CIL matters please visit the planning portal page at: www.planningportal.gov.uk/planning/applications/howtoapply/whattosubmit/cil",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the 'Saved' UDP 2007, Local Plan Part 1, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
