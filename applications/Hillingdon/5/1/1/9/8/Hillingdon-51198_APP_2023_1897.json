    "The proposed development, by reason of its proximity, siting, size, scale, bulk, height and fenestration treatment, would cause harm to the residential amenities of the neighbouring occupiers at number 8 and 10 Poplars Close, in terms of loss of sunlight/daylight, loss of outlook, loss of privacy and overlooking.  By virtue of the fenestration treatment, the proposed development would also cause harm to the amenities of the open space associated with Woodford Hall (Woodlands Day Nursery), in terms of  a perceived loss of privacy and overlooking. The proposal therefore conflicts with Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One- Strategic Policies (2012), Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The proposed development, by virtue of its narrow building width, and increased depth, scale, massing and height, coupled with the lack of set-in from the side boundaries, would result in the overdevelopment of a constrained site. This in turn, results in a cramped form of development that fails to respect the rhythm and spacing between buildings, which is identified as a positive contributor for the Ruislip Village Conservation Area. Furthermore, the choice of external materials would appear out of character with the immediate locality of the site. As a result, the proposed development would cause harm to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the area and would neither preserve or enhance the Ruislip Village Conservation Area. The proposal therefore conflicts with Policies  BE1 and HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One- Strategic Policies (2012), Policies DMHB 1, DMHB 4, DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies",
    "The proposed development, by virtue of poor outlook from the first floor front habitable windows which are labelled as being obscure glazed, would result in substandard forms of residential accommodation to the detriment of future occupiers of the proposed first floor flats. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies DMHB 15 and DMHB 16 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The proposed development, by virtue of the inadequate size of the external amenity space provision and lack of useability and functionality of the communal front garden spaces, would result in substandard form of living accommodation to the detriment of the future occupiers of the proposed flats. The proposal therefore conflicts with with Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One- Strategic Policies (2012), Policy DMHB 18 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The proposed development, by virtue of the position of the communal front garden space directly in front of the habitable room windows of the proposed ground floor flats and in the absence of any defensible space, would cause unacceptable overlooking, loss of privacy, noise and disturbance for the future occupants of these units. The proposal would therefore result in a substandard form of internal residential accommodation to the detriment of the amenity of the future occupiers of the proposed ground floor flats, contrary to Policies DMHB 15 and DMHB 16 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service. We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal.",
    "This is a reminder that Under the terms of the Planning Act 2008 (as amended) and Community Infrastructure Levy Regulations 2010 (as amended), should an application for appeal be allowed, the proposed development would be deemed as 'chargeable development' and therefore liable to pay the London Borough of Hillingdon Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and the Mayor of London's Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This would be calculated in accordance with the London Borough of Hillingdon CIL Charging Schedule 2014 and the Mayor of London's CIL Charging Schedule 2012.",
    "For more information on CIL matters please visit the planning portal page at: www.planningportal.gov.uk/planning/applications/howtoapply/whattosubmit/cil",
    "The submitted Location Plan shows two car parking spaces that fall outside of the red line boundary. Certificate B of the application form has been completed and the assessment of the application is based on the assumption that the applicant has rights over the land proposed for the parking is ensured."
