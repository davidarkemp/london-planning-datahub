    "The development will pose unacceptable amenity impacts to neighbouring properties, including dominance, overlooking and a sense of enclosure to the open space of Woodford Hall, overlooking and a loss of sunlight/daylight to and outlook from 8-10 Poplars Close and overlooking and noise disturbance from the northern courtyard to the ground floor flats, contrary to Policies BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan (Part 1) 2012 and Policies DMHD 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan (Part 2) 2020.",
    "The two detached flat buildings, by virtue of their narrow building width, nil side boundary setbacks, flat roof and boxed form and splayed front elevation, appear out of scale in their site context and relate poorly to and neither preserve or enhance but harm the character and appearance of the Ruislip Village Conservation Area as well as the surrounding area, contrary to Sections 12 and 16 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021, Policies D3 and HC1 of the London Plan 2021, Policies B1 and HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan (Part 1) 2012 and Policies DMHB1, DMHB 4, DMHB 11, Policy DMHB 12 and Policy DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan (Part 2) 2020.",
    "By virtue of insufficient internal floorspace, inadequate outdoor amenity space and poor connectivity thereto, the proposed units exhibit substandard amenity for future occupiers, contrary to Section 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021, Policy D6 of the London Plan 2021, Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan (Part 1) 2012 and Policies DMH 16 and DMH 18 of the Hillingdon Local Plan (Part 2) 2020",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service. We have also allowed for revisions to the scheme and assessed these revisions. However we have been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal.",
    "The submitted Location Plan does not include a red line boundary and the block plan shows four parking spaces that may or may not fall outside of the red line boundary. Certificate A of the application form has been completed and the assessment of the application is based on the assumption that ownership of the land proposed for the parking is ensured. Anything to the contrary would require Certificate B to be completed."
