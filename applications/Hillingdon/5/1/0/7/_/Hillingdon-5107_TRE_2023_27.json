    "The Horse Chestnut is situated on Porters Way in a row with two other chestnuts. It has a high amenity value and significantly contributes to the arboricultural character of the local area.",
    "It is agreed that there is some decay within the base of the branch where a branch has previously been removed. There is evidence of some reaction wood and limited information has been supplied by the applicant in relation to the level of decay. The branch the applicant wishes to remove is a major structural limb, the removal of which would adversely affect the shape of the canopy and therefore negatively affect the trees amenity value. It would also leave a large wound which is likely to lead to further decay. Currently there is not enough evidence supplied to justify this work, subject to an application it might be suitable to carry out a lighter weight reduction.",
    "Having regard to the reasons given for the proposed work, the work is unjustified and will have a detrimental impact on the visual am",
    "The removal of deadwood, dangerous / hanging branches and ivy:  This does not require the formal consent of the Council."
