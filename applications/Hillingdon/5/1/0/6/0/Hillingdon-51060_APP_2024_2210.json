    "The proposed two-storey side/rear extension, by reason of its size, scale, bulk, depth, width, height, proximity to the side boundary, and projection forward of the return building line along Hurstfield Crescent, in this open and prominent position, would result in the closing of an important gap characteristic to the area, resulting in a cramped appearance. The proposal would, therefore, represent an over-development of the site to the detriment of the visual amenities of the street scene and the character and appearance of the surrounding area. The proposed development is contrary to Policy BE 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012) and Policies DMHD 1 and DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service."
