    "The development, by virtue of the loss of the existing family dwelling, would conflict with the Borough's strategic housing goal of safeguarding family dwellings and the proposed change of use to a Large House in Multiple Occupation (HMO) would be harmful to the area's character. Consequently, the principle of development is considered to be unacceptable. The proposal is, therefore, contrary to Policies DMH 1 and DMH 5 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2023).",
    "The proposal has failed to demonstrate that sufficient off-street parking and secure cycle storage would be provided, as required by the local parking standard for the proposed occupancy level. The proposal has the potential to lead to undue on-street parking displacement to the detriment of parking capacity and safety on the local public highway, contrary to Local Plan: Part 2 Development Management Plan (2020) - Policies DMT 1, DMT 2 & DMT 6 (Appendix C) and Policy T4, T5 and T6  of the London Plan (2021).",
    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate that the proposal and the high number of potential occupants would not result in noise and general disturbance to neighbouring properties alongside a harmful over-intensification of the use of the site (through additional comings and goings generated by the additional occupants), detrimental to both the occupiers and neighbouring properties and the residential amenity of the area. The proposal is, therefore, contrary to Policies DMH 5, DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policies D3 and D13 of the London Plan (2021) and Paragraph 135f) of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023).",
    "The proposed HMO use would provide inadequate internal communal space to accommodate the proposed increase in occupants, coupled with an inadequately sized kitchen. Moreover, the application fails to demonstrate that noise transfer between the communal kitchen and ground floor HMO rooms could be adequately controlled to provide a suitable level of acoustic amenity for the future occupant(s), together with two rooms failing to provide adequate floor area for single occupancy. Collectively, these issues would result in a substandard form of accommodation for future occupants, contrary to Section 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023), Policies D6 and D14 of the London Plan (2021) and Policies DMH 5, DMHB 11 and DMHB 16 of the Hillingdon Local Plan - Part 2: Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service."
