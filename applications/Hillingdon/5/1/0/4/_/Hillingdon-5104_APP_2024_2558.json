    "The proposed rear extension, by virtue of its cumulative size, scale, bulk, design and proximity, would be detrimental to the amenities of the adjoining occupiers on 7 Maylands Drive, by reason of overdominance, visual intrusion, sense of enclosure and loss of outlook. Therefore, the proposal would be contrary to Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The proposed extension's design, scale, and appearance would not appear subordinate and sympathetic to the dwelling and neighbouring properties. The inappropriate extension would be out of keeping with the prevailing planning approved development pattern to the detriment of the subject dwelling's appearance and the area's character. The proposal is contrary to Policy D3 of The London Plan and Policies BE1, DMHB 5, DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the London Borough of Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service. We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
