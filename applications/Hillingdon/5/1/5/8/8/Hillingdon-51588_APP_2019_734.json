    "The proposal for the change of use of the premises from a retail/cafe (Use Class A1/A3) to childcare/nursery (Use Class D1) does not provide adequate information regarding car parking and on-site pickup and drop off facilities to the detriment of child safety and fails to have regard to existing highway and pedestrian safety concerns. The proposed use would result in an increase in parking stress on the local highway network and surrounding area which is already subject to considerable pressure and would create an environment that would present considerable hazard to pedestrians. The proposed use is therefore in conflict with Policies AM7 and AM14 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two Saved UDP Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMT 2 and DMT 6 of the Emerging Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies with Modifications (March 2019).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Unitary Development Plan Saved Policies (September 2007) as incorporated into the Hillingdon Local Plan (2012) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan - The Spatial Development Strategy for London consolidated with alterations since 2011 (2016) and national guidance.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the 'Saved' UDP 2007, Local Plan Part 1, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "In order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably. In addition further guidance was offered to the applicant by the case officer during the processing of the application to identify the amendments to address those elements of the scheme considered unacceptable which the applicant chose not to implement."
