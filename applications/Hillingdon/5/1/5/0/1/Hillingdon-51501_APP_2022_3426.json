    "The proposed development, by reason of the extension and alterations to the existing dormer, materials and colours, and design would fail to appear as a subordinate addition or harmonise with the architectural composition of the original dwelling and local character, having a harmful visual impact on the streetscene of Ferrers Avenue and the West Drayton Green Conservation Area. It would fail to either preserve or enhance the character of the conservation area, and there are no public benefits that would outweigh the identified less than substantial harm. The proposal would therefore be contrary Policies BE1 and HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012), Policies DMHB 1, DMHB 4, and DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two- Development Management Policies (2020), Policies HC1, D3, and D4 of the London Plan (2021) and Paragraphs 124, 130, 197, 199, 202 and 203 of the NPPF (2021) and Section 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) A"
