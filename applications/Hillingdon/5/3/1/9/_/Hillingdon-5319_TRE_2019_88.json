    "The Oak (T51) is situated in the rear garden of 5 Kewferry Road, to the side of a public footpath and also to the side of the Holy Trinity Church of England School. The tree has a very large, attractive, domed crown, and is a significant skyline feature in this, the southern part of, Kewferry Road. The Oak (T51) is highly visible and has a very high amenity value.",
    "The Oak tree has received numerous approvals for work in the past. The most recent was in 2017 to crown thin and lift, previously this tree has been managed on a three year cycle. As a result this Oak currently has an open attractive crown, further thinning only two years after the previous approval would likely give many of the branches a top heavy 'lion's tail' appearance.",
    "Having regard to the reasons given for the proposed work, the work is unjustified and will have a detrimental impact on the visual amenity and arboreal character of the area.",
    "The removal of deadwood, dangerous / hanging branches and ivy:  This does not require the formal consent of the Council."
