    "The proposed front and rear extensions, by reason of their design, overall size, scale, bulk and crown roofed design, would cumulatively result in a large, dominating and incongruous form of development which would fail to respect the proportions and appearance of the original dwelling and the pattern of development in the area. The proposal would thus be detrimental to the visual amenities of the street scene and the character and appearance of the wider West Drayton, Garden City Area of Special Local Character, contrary to Policies BE1 and HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), and Policies DMHB 1, DMHB 5, DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), Policies D3 and D8 of the London Plan (2021) and the NPPF (2021).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
