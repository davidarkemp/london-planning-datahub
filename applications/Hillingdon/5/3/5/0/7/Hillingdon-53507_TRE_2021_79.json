    "The group of Ash trees is located within the back garden of Tanglewood Highfield Close. These trees are part of a larger group of Ash trees which are all protected. The group of trees is also comprised within the Area of Special Local Character of Old Northwood, and represents an important feature for the local landscape. The group of trees significantly contribute to the local amenity of the area by providing a mature tree cover for the residents of adjacent properties. The trees also represent an important feature for the local biodiversity, by providing habitat for wildlife.",
