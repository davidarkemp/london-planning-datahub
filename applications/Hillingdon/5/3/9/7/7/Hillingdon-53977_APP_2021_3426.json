    "The proposed single storey side and rear extension, by virtue of the scale, siting, design, independent access, combined height, width and in particular depth would result in a visually intrusive, dominant, bulky, disproportionate, incongruous and uncharacteristic enlargement that would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original dwelling, or the established pattern of development in the area, to the detriment of the character, appearance, and visual amenities of the subject dwelling and the surrounding area. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012) and Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The proposed single storey side/rear extension, by virtue of the general enclosure, independent access, its size, scale, bulk, combined height, width and in particular excessive depth and proximity, would be detrimental to the amenities of the adjacent occupiers at 60 Blacklands Drive by reason of overdominance, visual intrusion, overbearing impact, sense of enclosure, loss of outlook and loss of light. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2021). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020."
