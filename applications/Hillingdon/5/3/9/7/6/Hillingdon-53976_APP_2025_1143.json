    "The cumulative impact of the proposed two storey rear extension and resulting crown and three hipped roof forms would result in additions to the dwelling that would not be considered to be subordinate in terms of size and scale and the proposed roof design would fail to respect the architectural composition of the existing dwelling. The proposed development would result in harm to the character and appearance of the dwelling and wider street scene, contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One Strategic (2012) and Policies DMDH 1, DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
