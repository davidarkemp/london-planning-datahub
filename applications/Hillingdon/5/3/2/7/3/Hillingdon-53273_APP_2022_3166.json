    "The proposed two-storey side extension and first floor rear extension, by reason of its prominent siting, lack of set backs, uncharacteristic roof transformation and combined height, width and depth would result in a disproportionate, incongruous, boxy, dominant and visually intrusive addition that would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original dwelling, relationship with the attached pair, character and appearance of the wider area and visual amenities of the streetscene. Therefore, the proposal would be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012), Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021), Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2021). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020."
