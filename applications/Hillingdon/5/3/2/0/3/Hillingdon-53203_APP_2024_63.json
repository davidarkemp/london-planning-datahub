    "The proposed development, namely the proposed first floor side extension, by reason of its size, scale, bulk, design and siting, would result in incongruous and cramped appearance, which would erode the prevailing sense of openness between dwellinghouses and harm the character and appearance of the original dwellinghouse and this part of the Harefield Village Conservation Area. The proposed development therefore would not preserve or enhance the character or appearance of the Conservation Area and would fail to comply with Policies BE1 and HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 4, DMHB 11, DMHB 12, Policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and Paragraph 208 of the NPPF (2023)."
