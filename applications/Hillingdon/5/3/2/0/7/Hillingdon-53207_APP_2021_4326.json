    "The proposed rear conservatory would result in a secondary extension to an existing extension, thereby extending the property more than 6m beyond the original rear building line and due to its height and overall depth, would not appear as a subordinate addition to the existing dwellinghouse. The proposal would therefore have a detrimental impact upon the character and appearance of the application site and the surrounding area contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "The proposed extension due to the scale, siting and design, which includes non-obscure glazed side windows facing 72 Wentworth Crescent would result loss of outlook, visual intrusion, overlooking and loss of privacy to the occupiers of the neighbouring property. The proposal would therefore cause harm to the residential amenity of neighbouring properties, contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020)."
