  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed development, by reason of the provision of facilities within and by having an access which is capable of being used independently, is considered capable of independent occupation from the main dwelling. As a result, the proposal would be tantamount to a separate self-contained residential unit in a position where such a dwelling would be unacceptable, due to being out of keeping with the pattern of surrounding development and requirements for parking, living accommodation and amenity space and the impact on adjoining properties. The proposal is, therefore, contrary to Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 16, DMHB 18, DMT 6 and DMHD 2 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The proposed outbuilding, by reason of its size, scale and bulk would not appear or function as a subservient addition to the main dwelling and would have a harmful impact on the character and appearance of the host dwelling and the surrounding Harlington Village Conservation Area and in the absence of a Heritage Assessment, the application has not demonstrated that the less than substantial harm to the significance of the Harlington Village Conservation Area would be outweighed by any public benefits of the proposal. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies BE1 and HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 1, DMHB 4, DMHB 11, DMHD 1 and DMHD 2 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), Policy HC1 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan and national guidance.",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
