    "The proposed development, by virtue of the poor overall layout including the reliance of side facing habitable windows to serve bedrooms would be a harmful effect upon the living conditions of the future occupants of Flat One and Two in terms of loss of privacy, overlooking issues, poor outlook, noise and disturbance. In addition, the front facing window (serving Bedroom 1)  of ground floor flat would be in close proximity the front access to both flats and car parking space.",
    "Furthermore the application has failed to demonstrate that there would be satisfactory amount of private usable external amenity space to serve both flats due to overlooking and lack of suitable access arrangements. Therefore, it would result in an unsatisfactory quality of internal and external residential accommodation to the   detriment of the amenity of the future occupiers of the proposed development, contrary to Policies DMHB 16  DMHB18 of the  Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Polici",
    "The development proposed, due to the lack of privacy to both adjoining neighbouring properties by reason of the patio/raised terrace and windows along the flank elevation would be harmful to neighbouring amenity by way of overlooking and loss of privacy. As such the proposed development is contrary to Policies DMHB 11 and  DMHB 18 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two (2020) and Policies D3 and D6 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan (2021)  and national guidance.",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2021). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
