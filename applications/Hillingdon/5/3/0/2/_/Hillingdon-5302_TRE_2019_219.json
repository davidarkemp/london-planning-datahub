    "The tree(s) to be pruned shall be crown lifted as per the approved specification / to a maximum height of 2.5m. This work shall involve the tip reduction of low hanging branches and/or the removal of low branches to the height specified and result in a tree of balanced appearance; those branches to be removed shall be removed at their origin and all branch collars shall be left intact.",
    "The works shall be carried out in accordance with the recommendations contained in BS 3998:2010 'Tree work - Recommendations'. Climbing irons or 'spikes' shall not be used during the execution of this work.",
    "REASON",
    "In order to protect health of the tree and the visual amenity of the area.",
    "Timing of works:  Pruning works should not be carried out during the period of bud burst and care should be taken to ensure that branches are cut back to healthy outward facing buds to avoid die-back to which some species are prone. For major works, such as pollarding or copping, work should only be carried out after the autumn leaf fall when the sap has gone down, and certainly well before the sap rises in the spring before bud burst has taken place.",
    "Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981:  Note that it is an offence under this act to disturb roosting bats, nesting birds or any other protected species.  Therefore, if applicable, it is advisable to consult your tree surgeon / consultant to agree an acceptable time for carrying out the approved works.",
    "Expected standard of tree work: The approved works must be carried out in accordance with the conditions laid out above. If they are not, then enforcement action could being taken which could lead to prosecution and heavy fines. Therefore, it is highly recommended that the works are only carried out by a professional and competent arboriculturist who undertakes to comply with the conditions of this consent and in accordance with industry best practice (BS 3998:2010). The Arboricultural Association can provide details of its approved contractors, who have demonstrated such professionalism and competence, on their website (www.trees.org.uk) or by calling 01242 522152. Or on request the Council can provide a list of contractors who are known to carry out tree work to a good standard and to normally maintain an appropriate policy of indemnity insurance.",

    "Two Yellow Sycamores - Crown thin by 20% and crown reduce in height to 4.5m and spread from 4.5m to 3.5m (within G15 on TPO 7)",
    "The Yew (T41 on TPO 7) is situated in the front garden of the property next to the road and footpath and is next to the southern boundary as part of a group of trees. The tree is moderately visible in the local landscape and has a moderate amenity value.",
    "The reasons given are not viewed as justified reasons for carrying out this level of pruning. It would unnecessarily introduce multiple wounds into the crown of this tree which would likely lead to infection. Additionally, the proposed work is considered to be too drastic and would reduce the size and amenity value of this tree significantly. This would lead to a detrimental impact on the natural appearance of this tree.",
    "The crown of this tree is not currently considered to be in need of reducing to this level and therefore the proposed work is unnecessary and unjustified.",
    "Having regard to the reasons given for the crown reduction of this tree, the proposed work is unnecessary, unjustified and will have a detrimental impact on the h",
