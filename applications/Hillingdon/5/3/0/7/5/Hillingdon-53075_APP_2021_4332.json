    "Due to the combination of its excessive width, height, depth, uncharacteristic features, large roof and bulky front elevation, the proposed dwelling is considered to be of poor design. Due to these features the dwelling would form an oversized, unsympathetic and unduly prominent addition to the streetscene, which would harm the visual amenities of the ASLC, street and surrounding area to the detriment of their character and appearance. The proposal is therefore considered to be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 5, DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), as well as policies D3 and D6 of the London Plan and paragraphs 130 (a) and (c) of the NPPF (2021).",
    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate that adequate and functional parking space could be provided for future occupiers of the dwelling. The absence of a functional parking layout could lead to roadside parking which would hinder vehicle movements in the area leading to traffic build up to the detriment of the highways network. It would also create a more hazardous environment for pedestrians and vehicle users, as cars at the site are reverse onto the road, due to insufficient or poor manoeuvring space. The proposed development is therefore considered to be detrimental to pedestrian and highway safety, as well as the free movement of vehicles on the local highways network. Additionally, no electrical vehicle charging points are proposed and it has not been demonstrated that adequate visibility splays would be provided. The proposed development is therefore considered to be contrary to Policies DMT 2 and DMT 6 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (J",
