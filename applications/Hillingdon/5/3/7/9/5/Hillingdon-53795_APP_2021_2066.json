    "The proposed extension, by reason of its overall size, scale, bulk, height, width, depth and design, including roof form, would result in an excessive, bulky, incongruous, dominant, overbearing and visually intrusive form of development that would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original building, would be detrimental to the character, appearance and visual amenities and would fail to either preserve or enhance the character or appearance of the surrounding Eastcote Park Estate Conservation Area. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies BE1 and HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 1, DMHB 4 and DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), Policy HC1 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2019).",
    "The proposed extension, by reason of its siting, size, scale, bulk, height and proximity, would be detrimental to the amenities of the adjoining occupiers at 19 and 23 St Lawrence Drive, by reason of overdominance, visual intrusion, overbearing impact, loss of daylight/sunlight and loss of outlook. As such, the proposal would be contrary to Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2016). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020.",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination)."
