    "The proposal would fail to provide a satisfactory residential environment for the future occupants of the HMO given the lack of a communal living area and that the communal kitchen area is substandard in size and has no outlook or natural lighting thus resulting in a substandard form of living accommodation and reliance upon artificial means of lighting which would fail to satisfy sustainability and energy efficiency objectives and would be to the detriment of the amenity of future occupiers, contrary to Policies DMH5 and DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and Policies D6 and SI2 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "The proposal would result in an overintensive use of the site to the detriment of the residential amenities of adjoining occupiers by reason of noise and disturbance. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to policy DMH5 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and Policy D14 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan (2021) and national guidance.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
