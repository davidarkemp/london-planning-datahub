    "No felling shall take place until such time as a scheme has been submitted to, and approved in writing by, the Local Planning Authority for a replacement tree(s), which shall be of 'Standard' size (about 2-3m high) and short-staked for support. The replacement tree shall be planted during the first planting season following the felling works hereby permitted. Thereafter, the replacement tree(s) shall be retained indefinitely and maintained (watered and weeded during the spring and summer) for 2-3 years, or until established.",
    "REASON",
    "In order to comply with the requirements of Section 206 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990.",
    "Owner(s)'s permission:  Permission should be sought from the owner(s) of the tree(s) and / or the owner(s) of the land that the tree(s) overhang prior to any approved work being carried out.",
    "Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981:  Note that it is an offence under this act to disturb roosting bats, nesting birds or any other protected species.  Therefore, if applicable, it is advisable to consult your tree surgeon / consultant to agree an acceptable time for carrying out the approved works.",
    "Risk of heave: You are advised that a risk of soil heave and heave-related damage to properties may arise following the felling / removal of trees. Therefore, it is advisable for you to obtain independent expert advice prior to carrying out the approved tree felling. Hillingdon Council cannot and will not accept responsibility or liability for any damages associated with the implementation of this consent."
