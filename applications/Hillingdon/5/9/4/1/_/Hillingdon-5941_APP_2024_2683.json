    "The proposed development, given the number of potential occupants across 6 no. separate bedrooms would give rise to undue noise and general disturbance to neighbouring residents, particularly as a result of a marked increase in comings and goings, use of the rear garden and the lack of information relating to sound insulation. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policies DMH 5 and DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and paragraph 135 (f) of the NPPF (2024).",
    "The proposed development would result in the creation of a 6 bedroom HMO with no off road vehicular parking spaces. No robust travel plan or transport assessment has been submitted detailing how the significant parking provision shortfall or increased vehicular trip generation would impact on the local highways network.In addition the proposal fails to meet the Council's cycle storage standards.  As a result the applicant has failed to demonstrate the proposed development would have no adverse impact on the local highways network or its users and it is considered that the lack of off road parking would lead to roadside parking, which would lead to The proposal is therefore considered to be contrary to Policies DMT 2, DMT 4 and DMT 6 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy T4 and T6 of the London Plan (2021) and paragraph 116 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2024).",
    "The proposed Large HMO would provide inadequate internal communal space to accommodate the proposed increase in the number of occupants, coupled with an inadequately sized kitchen. The application fails to demonstrate that noise transfer between the communal kitchen and ground floor HMO rooms could be adequately controlled, in order to provide a suitable level of acoustic amenity for the future occupants together with poor level of privacy for the front facing HMOs rooms. Collectively, these issues would result in a substandard form of accommodation for future occupants, contrary to Chapter 12 of the NPPF (2024), Policies D6, D14 and H9 of the London Plan (2021) and Policies DMH 5, DMHB 11 and DMHB 16 of the Hillingdon Local Plan - Part 2: Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
