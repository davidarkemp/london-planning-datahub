  "decision_conditions": [
    "The Ash trees are situated in the rear garden of 28 Burlington Close. The mature trees are in a moderate condition and form part of a group of trees that can be viewed from Cuckoo Hill when entering Hillingdon from Harrow, and contribute to the arboreal character of the area. For this reason, the trees have a moderate amenity value.",
    "The proposal to crown thin by 25% has been refused as this is considered too severe for the species. Thinning by this degree could place unnecessary stress on the tree by removing a large amount of its foliage, reducing its capacity to photosynthesise and to maintain energy reserves. This could prompt a flush of dense, upright regrowth which results in weakly attached shoots and a crowded canopy. Over time, this can compromise the tree's structure, increase maintenance needs, and reduce its overall resilience.",
    "The proposal to remove overhanging branches has also been refused as the application does not state how much the overhanging branches will be prune",
    "The removal of deadwood, dangerous / hanging branches and ivy:  This does not require the formal consent of the Council.",
    "Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981:  Note that it is an offence under this act to disturb roosting bats, nesting birds or any other protected species.  Therefore, if applicable, it is advisable to consult your tree surgeon / consultant to agree an acceptable time for carrying out the approved works.",
    "Owner(s)'s permission:  Permission should be sought from the owner(s) of the tree(s) and / or the owner(s) of the land that the tree(s) overhang prior to any approved work being carried out.",
    "Expected standard of tree work: The approved works must be carried out in accordance with the conditions laid out above. If they are not, then enforcement action could being taken which could lead to prosecution and heavy fines. Therefore, it is highly recommended that the works are only carried out by a professional and competent arboriculturist who undertakes to comply with the conditions of this consent and in accordance with industry best practice (BS 3998:2010). The Arboricultural Association can provide details of its approved contractors, who have demonstrated such professionalism and competence, on their website (www.trees.org.uk) or by calling 01242 522152. Or on request the Council can provide a list of contractors who are known to carry out tree work to a good standard and to normally maintain an appropriate policy of indemnity insurance.",
    "Lateral crown reduction by 2m on all trees applied for on application.",
    "Crown thin by 25% and remove lower branches that overhang into the garden of 28.",
    "The tree(s) to be pruned shall be crown reduced (laterally / lower crown) by a maximum of 2m. This work shall comprise a reduction in spread over the whole crown by shortening or removing peripheral branches in a uniform and systematic manner.  Where branches are shortened, they should be cut back to a suitably positioned secondary branch.",
    "Crown reduction shall not be construed as 'lopping' or 'topping' and shall result in a tree of typical form for the species and of balanced appearance. The works shall be carried out in accordance with the recommendations contained in BS 3998:2010 'Tree work - Recommendations'. Climbing irons or 'spikes' shall not be used during the execution of the work.",
    "REASON",
    "In order to protect health of the tree and the visual amenity of the area."
