    "The ash trees are situated in the rear garden of 28 Burlington Close. They form part of a group of trees that can be viewed from Cuckoo Hill when entering Hillingdon from Harrow, and contribute to the arboreal character of the area. For this reason, the trees have a moderate amenity value.",
    "No valid arboricultural reasons have been provided as to why the ash trees require crown reduction work - reduction and thinning work to a deciduous tree in relation to light is not considered a valid arboricultural reason.",
    "In relation to the size of the trees, a 3m reduction in height and a 2.5m lateral reduction is too severe and the total volume of crown being removed in this case will exceed what we consider to be reasonable amount.",
    "Removing a high percentage of a tree's crown can be detrimental to its health for several reasons including reduced photosynthesis, increased stress due to wounding (making the tree more susceptible to pests and diseases), and nutrient loss (due to a loss of nutri",
    "The removal of deadwood, dangerous / hanging branches and ivy:  This does not require the formal consent of the Council.",
    "Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981:  Note that it is an offence under this act to disturb roosting bats, nesting birds or any other protected species.  Therefore, if applicable, it is advisable to consult your tree surgeon / consultant to agree an acceptable time for carrying out the approved works.",
    "Owner(s)'s permission:  Permission should be sought from the owner(s) of the tree(s) and / or the owner(s) of the land that the tree(s) overhang prior to any approved work being carried out.",
    "Expected standard of tree work: The approved works must be carried out in accordance with the conditions laid out above. If they are not, then enforcement action could being taken which could lead to prosecution and heavy fines. Therefore, it is highly recommended that the works are only carried out by a professional and competent arboriculturist who undertakes to comply with the conditions of this consent and in accordance with industry best practice (BS 3998:2010). The Arboricultural Association can provide details of its approved contractors, who have demonstrated such professionalism and competence, on their website (www.trees.org.uk) or by calling 01242 522152. Or on request the Council can provide a list of contractors who are known to carry out tree work to a good standard and to normally maintain an appropriate policy of indemnity insurance."
