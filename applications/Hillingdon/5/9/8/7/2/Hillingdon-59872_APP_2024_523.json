As such, the Applicant has failed to demonstrate that the development would deliver the maximum reasonable level of affordable housing and the proposal would fail to comply with Paragraph 62 of the NPPF (2023), Policy H4 of the London Plan (2021), and Policy DMH 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
