    "2. Care must be taken to ensure that overspill and/or other interference from induction loops in different/adjacent areas does not occur.",

    "The red-line plan submitted with the application documents indicates that part of the development site boundary is within Crossrail safeguarded limits and also encroaches onto Network Rail (NR) freehold land. Network Rail are undertaking 'cable pulling' works in connection with the construction of Crossrail at this location. Information relating to the works and the timescales involved for the works are available through the following contact email address 'CRCrossrail@networkrail.co.uk'",
    "The applicant is advised to confirm with Network Rail the land title boundaries and also the current works programme before commencing of any of their proposed works in order to avoid any conflicts of interest for either the land ownership or the disruption to the Crossrail/NR construction programme.",
    "Fencing",
    "If not already in place, the Developer/applicant must provide at their expense a suitable trespass proof fence (of at least 1.8m in height) adjacent to Network Rail's boundary and make provision for it's future maintenance without encroachment upon Network Rail land. Network Rail's existing fencing/wall must not be removed or damaged and at no point either during construction or after works are completed on site should the foundations of the fencing or wall or any embankment therin be damaged, undermined or compromised in any way. Any vegetation on Network Rail land within Network Rail's boundary must also not be disturbed.",
    "Drainage",
    "Additional or increased flows of surface water should not be discharged onto Network Rail land or into Network Rail's culvert or drains.  In the interest of the long-term stability of the railway, it is recommended that soakaways should not be constructed within 20 metres of Network Rail's boundary.  Any surface water run-off from the site must dra",

    "(i) Demolition and construction works should only be carried out between the hours of 0800 and 1800 on Monday to Friday and between the hours of 0800 and 1300 on Saturday.  No works should be carried out on Sundays, Public or Bank Holidays;",
    "(ii) All noise generated during such works should be controlled in compliance with British Standard 5228, and use \"best practicable means\" as defined in section 72 of the Control of Pollution Act 1974;",
    "(iii) Measures should be taken to eliminate the release of dust, odours and other emissions caused by the works that may create a public health nuisance.  Guidance on control measures is given in \"The control of dust and emissions from construction and demolition: best practice guidelines\", Greater London Authority, Novem",
    "A Groundwater Risk Management Permit from Thames Water will be required for discharging groundwater into a public sewer.  Any discharge made without a permit is deemed illegal and may result in prosecutions under the provisions of the Water Industry Act 1991. We would expect the developer to demonstrate what measures he will undertake to minimise groundwater discharges into the public sewer. Permit enquiries should be directed to Thames Water's Risk Management Team by telephoning 02035779483 or by emailing wwqriskmanagement@thameswater.co.uk. Application forms should be completed on line via www.thameswater.co.uk/wastewaterquality.",
    "Given the nature of the proposed development it is possible that a crane may be required during its construction.  We would, therefore, draw the applicant's attention to the requirement within the British Standard Code of Practice for the safe use of Cranes, for crane operators to consult the aerodrome before erecting a crane in close proximity to an aerodrome.  This is explained further in Advice Note 4, 'Cranes and Other Construction Issues' (available at http://www.aoa.org.uk/policy-safeguarding.htm).",
