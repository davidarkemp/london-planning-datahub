    "The submitted details, the proposed location for the public access to the rear of the building and the lack of accessibility, fail ensure that the development provides access to the podium to non-residents of the Assembly Buildings, ensuring integration with the wider site and creating an acceptable level of social infrastructure and quality of street design to comply with Policy DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 (2020) and London Plan Policies S1 and S4 (2021).",
    "At ground floor level the proposed staircase would block the tracking route provided by the applicant in the Section 2.5 of the Design and Access Statement (Rev B June 2020) submitted with the amended proposals (application reference 59872/APP/2020/342). As such it has not been demonstrated that the proposed staircase would not have a detrimental impact on vehicle movements and therefore parking and servicing availability for the development.",
    "The proposed stairs would also result in a loss of parking as they are located where a parking space is approved at first floor level (as shown on approved drawing number WH199/20/P/25.02a Rev A). In addition the proposals would result in the loss of external amenity spaces on the podium (as shown on approved drawing number WH199/20/P/25.03a Rev A). The loss of parking and the loss of external amenity space are not considered to be acceptable."
