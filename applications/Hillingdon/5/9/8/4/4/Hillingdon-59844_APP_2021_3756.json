    "The proposed rear and roof additions, by virtue of their siting, height, bulk and design would result in an incongruous development of poor design which fails to preserve or enhance the character and appearance of the host dwelling, terrace group, streetscene and wider Rockingham Bridge Conservation Area. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 1, DMHB 4, DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",

    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Development Management Policies (2020) as incorporated into the Hillingdon Local Plan (2012) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan - (2021) and national guidance."
