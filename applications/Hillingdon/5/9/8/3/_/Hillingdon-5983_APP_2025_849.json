    "By reason of its overall design, site layout, scale, long access road and gardenland, backland location, the proposal represents an overdevelopment of the site which would result in a cramped and contrived form of development. The proposal would therefore represent an overdevelopment of the site to the detriment of the visual amenities of the street scene and the character and appearance of the surrounding area. The development would not appear more intimate in mass and scale, rather it would appear over dominating in this gardenland and backland location. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMH 6, DMHB 11, DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) Policies D1 and D4 of the London Plan (2021) and the NPPF (2024).",
    "The proposed vehicle access gate would require vehicles to reverse onto an A-class classified road, creating a significant risk to highway safety. Furthermore, the applications lacks sufficient information regarding eh gradient of the site access which raises concerns regarding safety and manoeuvrability of vehicles and pedestrians using the access. Additionally, the angle of the vehicle access is substandard, further comprising safe and convenient entry and exit of the site. Therefore, the development would increase the risk of collision. As such the  development is contrary to Policies DMT 1, DMT 2, and DMT 6 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), as well as policies T2, T4 and T6 of the London Plan (2021) and paragraph 116 of the NPPF (2024).",
    "The proposed development would result in substandard living conditions for future occupants by reason of inadequate internal and external living accommodation. In the absence of supporting information, the proposed layout and design would fail to provide adequate levels of outlook daylight and sunlight for all habitable rooms within Unit A. Furthermore, the proposed external amenity space for Unit A is considered inadequate in terms of both quality and usability. The garden area would be subject to the impression of overlooking and significantly overshadowed and views from within the garden would appear oppressive and high sense of enclosure, due to the poor relationship with the two storey side elevation of Unit B, severely compromising the privacy, enjoyment, and functionality of the space. As such, the proposal would fail to provide acceptable levels of private outdoor amenity space for future residents, contrary to policy requirements. The proposed development would fail to provide",
    "The proposed development in terms of the number of units, design, site layout, intensification, highway impact and insufficient garden space would cumulatively result in an overdevelopment of the site. Although it is acknowledged that the development would provide additional family sized dwellings; it is not considered that the public benefits would outweigh the significant harm identified. As such the proposed development is contrary to paragraph 11 of the NPPF (2024)",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2016). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "This is a reminder that Under the terms of the Planning Act 2008 (as amended) and Community Infrastructure Levy Regulations 2010 (as amended), should an application for appeal be allowed, the proposed development would be deemed as 'chargeable development' and therefore liable to pay the London Borough of Hillingdon Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and the Mayor of London's Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This would be calculated in accordance with the London Borough of Hillingdon CIL Charging Schedule 2014 and the Mayor of London's CIL Charging Schedule 2012.",
