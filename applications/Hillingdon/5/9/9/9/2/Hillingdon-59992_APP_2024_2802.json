    "The proposed development, given the number of potential occupants across 7no. separate bedrooms would give rise to undue noise and general disturbance to neighbouring residents, particularly as a result of a marked increase in comings and goings, use of the rear garden and the lack of information relating to sound insulation. The proposal would therefore be contrary to the requirements of Policies DMH 5 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and paragraph 135 (f) of the NPPF (2024).",
    "The proposed development, on account of the lack of privacy to Bedrooms 1,2 and 3 would result in a poor standard of accommodation for future residents to the detriment of their amenities. The proposal is therefore considered to be contrary to Policies DMH 5 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021), as well as paragraph 135 (f) of the NPPF (2024).",
    "The proposed development would result in the creation of a 7 bedroom HMO with 1 off road vehicular parking space. No robust travel plan or transport assessment, has been submitted detailing how the significant parking provision shortfall or increased vehicular trip generation would impact on the local highways network. As a result the applicant has failed to demonstrate the proposed development would have no adverse impact on the local highways network or its users and it is considered that the lack of off road parking would lead to roadside parking, which would lead to The proposal is therefore considered to be contrary to Policies DMT 2, DMT 4 and DMT 6 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy T4 and T6 of the London Plan (2021) and paragraph 116 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2024).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan (2021) and national guidance."
