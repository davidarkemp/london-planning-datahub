  "description": "Single storey outbuilding to rear for ancillary use.",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed outbuilding by reason of its size, scale and design would create an unduly incongruous form of development which would fail to be subordinate to the existing building and would be detrimental to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHD 2, DMH6, DMHB 14 and DMHB 18 of the Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The proposed outbuilding, by reason of its size, scale, internal layout and capacity for independent access is considered capable of independent occupation separate from the main dwelling and is thus tantamount to a separate dwelling in a position where such a dwelling would not be accepted due to requirements for parking and amenity space and the impact on the adjoining properties. It therefore results in an overdevelopment of the site, out of character with the spacious character and layout of the area and contrary to Policies DMH 6, DMHB 11, DMHD 2, DMHB 18 and DMT 6 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two -Development Management Policies (2020) and Policy 3.5 of the London Plan.",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan - The Spatial Development Strategy for London consolidated with alterations since 2011 (2016) and national guidance.",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant saved policies (referred to as policies from the Hillingdon Unitary Development Plan - Saved Policies September 2007), then London Plan Policies (2016). On the 8th November 2012 Hillingdon's Full Council agreed the adoption of the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies. Appendix 5 of this explains which saved policies from the old Unitary Development (which was subject to a direction from Secretary of State in September 2007 agreeing that the policies were 'saved') still apply for development control decisions.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the 'Saved' UDP 2007, Local Plan Part 1, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
