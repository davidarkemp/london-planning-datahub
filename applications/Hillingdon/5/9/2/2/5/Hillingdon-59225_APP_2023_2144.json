    "The proposed development, by reason of its cumulative size, scale, bulk, massing, design, roof form, materials and fenestration would appear as a disproportionate and incongruous form of development that would fail to harmonise with or be sympathetic to the architectural composition of the original dwelling, and would be detrimental to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the street scene. The proposed development would fail to preserve the appearance and character of the Ruislip village conservation area, resulting in less than substantial harm. There are no public benefits to outweigh the harm identified. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies HE1 and BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012), Policies DMHB 4, DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local plan - Part Two (2020), Policies HC1 and D3 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The proposed development, by reason of the siting and close proximity of the proposed side facing habitable window in the two storey rear extension, would result in visual intrusion, overlooking and an unacceptable loss of privacy (both real and perceived) for the neighbouring occupiers at number 16 Church Avenue.  The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012), Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy  D3 of the London Plan (2021) and paragraph 130 (f) of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2021). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "In order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably. In addition further guidance was offered to the applicant by the case officer during the processing of the application to identify the amendments to address those elements of the scheme considered unacceptable which the applicant chose not to implement."
