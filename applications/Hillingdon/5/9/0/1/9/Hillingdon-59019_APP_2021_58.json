  "description": "Single storey side/rear extension and conversion of roofspace to habitable use to include a conversion of the side hips to gable ends, a rear dormer and 3 x front rooflights.",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed development by reason of the size, scale, bulk and design of the conversion of the side hips to gables and the rear dormer window and the scale, design and detailing of the side and rear extensions would represent a visually unsympathetic form of development that would fail to preserve or enhance the character and appearance of the Harefield Village Conservation Area, fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original dwelling and would be detrimental to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the street scene and the wider Conservation Area. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies BE1  and HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 4, DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service."
