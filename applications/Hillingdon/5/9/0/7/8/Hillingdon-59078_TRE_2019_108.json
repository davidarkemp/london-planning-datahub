    "These mature Copper Beech trees (T2 and T4) are situated in the rear garden of the property to the south with T4 being about 5m away from the property and the other tree (T2) being some 18.1m away from the property.  Both of these trees do not appear to have been significantly pruned before and, as a result, they have retained an attractive, natural looking crown, typical for this species. The trees are highly visible and have a high amenity value making a significant contribution to the visual amenity and arboreal character of the local area.",

These works would unnecessarily introduce multiple wounds to the crowns of  these trees which would likely lead to infection. Additionally, the proposed work would be detrimental to the amenity value of these trees and would more generally have a detrimental impact on their natural appearance.",
