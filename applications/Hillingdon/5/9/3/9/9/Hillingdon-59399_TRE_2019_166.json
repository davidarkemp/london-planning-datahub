    "The Common Ash (T9) is situated in the rear garden of 2a Hillingdon Hill, next to the western boundary of the property. The tree is prominent in the local landscape and has a moderate amenity value - making a good contribution to the visual amenity and arboreal character of the local area. It is an important landscape feature, near to the junction of Kingston Lane and Hillingdon Hill and is clearly visible from all sides. This mature tree is approximately 14m tall and stands approximately 8m away from the property.",
    "The removal of this tree would be very regrettable due to the important contribution this mature tree makes to the local landscape  The reasons given for tree removal provided in this application are not considered to be justified reasons for removal and removal of this tree would be detrimental to the longer-term visual amenity and arboreal character of the local area.",
