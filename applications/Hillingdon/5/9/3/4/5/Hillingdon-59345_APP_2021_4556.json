    "The site lies in a Critical Drainage Area (CDA) as identified in the Surface Water Management Plan (SWMP) for Hillingdon. A CDA is the catchment area from which surface water drains and contributes to drainage problems. All developments in this area must contribute to managing the risk of flooding from surface water by reducing surface water runoff from the site. Therefore the applicant should minimise the water from your site entering the sewers. No drainage to support the extension should be connected to any existing surface water sewer, other than as an overflow. Water run off from any roof or hard paving associated with the development should be directed to a soakaway, or tank or made permeable. This includes any work to front gardens not part of the planning application, which must be permeable or be collected and directed to a permeable area, otherwise it would need an additional permission. A water butt should be incorporated.",
    "The development hereby permitted shall not be carried out except in complete accordance with the details shown on the submitted plans, numbers 2290.1 REV A and shall thereafter be retained/maintained for as long as the development remains in existence.",
    "REASON",
    "To ensure the development complies with the provisions of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012), Part 2 (2020) and the London Plan (2021).",
    "The outbuilding hereby approved shall only be used for the purpose(s) stated on the application form and approved drawings. It shall not be used for purposes such as a living room, bedroom, kitchen, bathroom,  or as a separate unit of accommodation and no internal partitions shall be installed or walls formed to enclose the space covered by the overhang to the front of the outbuilding.",
    "REASON",
    "To avoid any future undesirable fragmentation of the curtilage or the creation of a separate residential use, so as to protect the amenity of adjoining residential properties in accordance with Policy DMHB11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan - Part Two (2020)."
