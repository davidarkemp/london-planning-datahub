    "The development leads to an unacceptable residential conversion with poor quality living conditions as Flats 1 and 2 do not meet their requisite minimum floor space standards, the residential conversion is not limited to one unit per floor and their is substandard provision of amenity space. The development is therefore contrary to the requirements of Policies DMH 4, DMHB 18 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), policy D6 of the London Plan (2021) and the Technical Housing Standards - Nationally Described Space Standard (2015).",
    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate a satisfactory policy-led approach to the provision of the car parking. The proposed developments car parking provision is substandard and is likely to result in vehicle displacement onto the highway. Displacement onto the highway could create a more hazardous road network for its users, as well as stress and nuisance to local residents in terms of parking availability, all of which prejudices highway safety. The proposal is therefore considered to be contrary to Policies DMT 2 and DMT 6 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), as well as policy T6.1 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan - The Spatial Development Strategy for London consolidated with alterations since 2011 (2016) and national guidance."
