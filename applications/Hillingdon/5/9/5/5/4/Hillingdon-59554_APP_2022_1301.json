    "The development, by virtue of the design, scale and height of the roof extension, would result in a disproportionate, incongruous, and overly dominant form of development which is discordant with the property. Therefore the proposal would fail to harmonise with the unique architectural composition of the original dwelling and would subsequently harm the visual relationship with the immediate neighbours. The proposal relates poorly to other properties in the local area and would harm both the character and appearance of the street scene and the visual amenities of the surrounding area. As a whole, the proposal would be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012), Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021) and Chapter 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021)."
