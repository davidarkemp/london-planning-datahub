    "Due to its excessive size, bulk, mass and design in combination with the existing extensions, the proposed development would form a disproportionate and overly dominant addition to the host dwelling which would fail to respect its original size or architectural composition, subsequently causing significant harm to its character and appearance. Furthermore due to the design and prominent location, the resulting property would appear unduly prominent and overdeveloped when viewed from the street scene, causing significant harm to the character and appearance of the surrounding area. The proposed development is therefore considered to be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHD 1, DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020) and paragraph 135 of the NPPF (2023)."
