  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed part single storey, part two storey rear extensions, by virtue of their cumulative excessive size, scale, bulk, and design would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original dwelling and would fail to preserve or enhance the character and appearance of the The Greenway Conservation Area. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policy BE1 and HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 4, DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), policies D4, D8 and HC1 of the London Plan (2021) and the NPPF (2021).",
    "The proposed part single storey, part two storey rear extensions, by reason of their cumulative size, design and proximity, would result in an overly dominant feature that overshadows the adjoining property at No.84 Chiltern View Road, and as such would result in a visually intrusive and an un-neighbourly form of development, resulting in a loss of light and material loss of residential amenity. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policies DMHD 1 and DMHB11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan - Part Two (2020).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "In order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably. In addition further guidance was offered to the applicant by the case officer during the processing of the previous application to identify the amendments to address those elements of the scheme considered unacceptable which the applicant chose not to implement."
