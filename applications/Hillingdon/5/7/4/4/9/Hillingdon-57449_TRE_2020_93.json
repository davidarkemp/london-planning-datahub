  "description": "Reduce one Lawson Cypress by approx 2-3m in height and cut back several branches back into canopy to keep a cylindrical shape (T1 on plan, within G1 on TPO 146) and to fell six Lawson Cypress (T2-T7 on plan within G1 on TPO 146)",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "To fell four Lawson Cypress trees (T2, T3, T5 and T6 on plan within G1 on TPO 146)",
    "No felling shall take place until such time as a scheme has been submitted to, and approved in writing by, the Local Planning Authority for replacement tree(s) to replace T2, T3, T5 and T6, which shall be of 'Standard' size (about 2-3m high) and short-staked for support. The replacement treeS shall be planted during the first planting season following the felling works hereby permitted. Thereafter, the replacement tree(s) shall be retained indefinitely and maintained (watered and weeded during the spring and summer) for 2-3 years, or until established.",
    "REASON",
    "In order to comply with the requirements of Section 206 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990.",
    "Timing of works:  Pruning works should not be carried out during the period of bud burst and care should be taken to ensure that branches are cut back to healthy outward facing buds to avoid die-back to which some species are prone. For major works, such as pollarding or copping, work should only be carried out after the autumn leaf fall when the sap has gone down, and certainly well before the sap rises in the spring before bud burst has taken place.",
    "Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981:  Note that it is an offence under this act to disturb roosting bats, nesting birds or any other protected species.  Therefore, if applicable, it is advisable to consult your tree surgeon / consultant to agree an acceptable time for carrying out the approved works.",
    "Risk of heave: You are advised that a risk of soil heave and heave-related damage to properties may arise following the felling / removal of trees. Therefore, it is advisable for you to obtain independent expert advice prior to carrying out the approved tree felling. Hillingdon Council cannot and will not accept responsibility or liability for any damages associated with the implementation of this consent.",
    "Stump removal: After felling, tree stumps are frequently colonised by honey fungus (Armillaria sp.) which is known to spread and colonise nearby trees. Some trees and woody plants can often be killed by honey fungus and, therefore, it is advisable to remove the tree stump and roots as soon as possible after felling.",
    "To reduce by approx 2-3m in height and cut back several branches back into canopy to keep a cylindrical shape T1 within G1 on TPO 146) and fell two Lawson Cypress trees ( T4 & T7 within G1 on TPO 146)",
    "Refusal of part of the requested works: The applicant retains a right of appeal against the part of the application that has effectively been refused",
    "To reduce by approx 2-3m in height and cut back several branches back into canopy to keep a cylindrical shape T1 within G1 on TPO 146) and fell two Lawson Cypress trees ( T4 & T7 within G1 on TPO 146)",
    "With regard to the proposed reduction of T1 Lawson Cypress - these works are considered to be unnecessarily drastic and will reduce both the size and amenity value of this tree. These works are considered to be unjustified and unnecessary. This will result in a negative impact on the visual amenity and arboreal character of the local area.",
    "The proposed felling of T4 & T7 is also considered to be unjustified as these trees have a moderate amenity value and the loss of these trees will also have a negative impact on the visual amenity and arboreal character of the local area.",
    "Conclusion: Having regard to the reasons given for carrying out these pruning and felling works - these works are not considered to be justified and these works will have a negative impact on the visual amenity and arboreal character of the local area."
