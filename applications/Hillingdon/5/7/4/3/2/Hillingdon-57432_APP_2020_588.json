The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy DMTC 2 of the adopted Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020) and Policies 2.15 and 4.9 of the London Plan (2016).",
    "The proposal by reason of the lack of detail in relation to the provision and location of a suitable extract flue, has failed to demonstrate that the change of use would not result in an unacceptable loss of residential amenity to adjoining resident in terms of in terms of noise, disturbance and odour contrary to Policy DMTC 4 of the adopted Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan - The Spatial Development Strategy for London consolidated with alterations since 2011 (2016) and national guidance.",
