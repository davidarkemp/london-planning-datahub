  "decision_conditions": [
    "The outbuilding, by reason of its siting, position, size, scale and bulk, in conjunction with previous extensions to the property results in an overdevelopment of the site which is detrimental to the openness and visual amenity of the surrounding area. Therefore the development is contrary to Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 2  of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The proposed outbuilding would, by virtue of its failure to maintain an adequate amount of private usable external amenity space for the occupiers of the existing property, results in an over-development of the site detrimental to the residential amenity of the existing and future occupiers. The proposal is therefore contrary to policies DMHD 2, DMHB 11 and DMHB 18 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2016). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020."
