  "description": "Single storey outbuilding to rear for use as a store (Part Retrospective)",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The outbuilding in combination with the existing 6 outbuildings on site, by reason of their cumulative size, scale and bulk would result in a visually obtrusive form of development, which is out of character with the pattern of prevailing development in the area to the detriment of the character and appearance of the original dwelling and the visual amenities of the wider Garden City, West Drayton Area of Special Local Character. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies BE1 and HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies BE5, BE13, BE15 and BE19 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Saved UDP Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 1, DMHB 5 and DMHD 2 and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document HDAS: Residential Extensions.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. The Council's supports pre-application discussions.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
