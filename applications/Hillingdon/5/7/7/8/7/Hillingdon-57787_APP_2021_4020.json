    "Due to its bulky, oversized and uncharacteristic crown roof, coupled with the prominent first floor side extension and large dormers, the proposed development would harm the character and appearance of the existing dwelling and would fail to respect its original architectural composition. Furthermore, the resultant dwelling would read as an unduly prominent and uncharacteristic addition to the Foxdell streetscene. The proposed development is therefore considered to be harmful to the appearance of host dwelling and surrounding area; contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), as well as paragraph 130 of the NPPF (2021) and Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan - The Spatial Development Strategy for London consolidated with alterations since 2011 (2016) and national guidance."
