  "description": "Redevelopment of site to provide a part three storey, part two storey building composing of 3 x 1 bed flats and 2 x 2 bed  flats with associated parking and amenity space involving the demolition of existing detached dwelling",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed development by reason of its siting, size, scale, bulk, elongated depth and mixture of design styles would be detrimental to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) Policies DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), Policies 3.5 and 7.4 of the London Plan (2016) and the NPPF.",
    "The proposed development, by reason of the siting of flank habitable room windows, given their proximity to the side boundary and flank walls of adjoining properties, would result in the provision of habitable rooms with very limited levels of natural lighting and outlook that would result in a substandard form of living accommodation and reliance upon artificial means of lighting which would fail to satisfy sustainability and energy efficiency objectives and would be to the detriment of the amenity of future occupiers, contrary to Policy DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and Policies 3.5 and 5.3 of the London Plan (March 2016) and the Mayor of London's adopted Supplementary Planning Guidance - Housing (March 2016).",
    "The proposed development, by virtue of the siting of the new driveway to the side of the building and the siting of the proposed parking spaces would result in unacceptable harm to the living conditions of future occupiers, by reason of noise and disturbance from vehicles arriving and departing at all times of the day/night, contrary to Policy DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and Policy 3.5 of the London Plan (March 2016).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan - The Spatial Development Strategy for London consolidated with alterations since 2011 (2016) and national guidance.",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2016). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020."
