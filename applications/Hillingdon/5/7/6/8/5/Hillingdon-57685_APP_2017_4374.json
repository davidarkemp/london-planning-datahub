  "description": "Change of use of existing agricultural land to a Gypsy site for six Gypsy Traveller Families. Siting of six static caravans, four touring caravans with associated hardstanding and infrastructure (Part retrospective).",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The residential use and associated development represents inappropriate development within the Green Belt in terms of the guidance contained in the National Planning Policy Framework which is harmful by definition to its open character and appearance. Furthermore, there are no very special circumstances provided or which are evident which either singularly or cumulatively justify the permanent or temporary retention of the residential use which would overcome the presumption against inappropriate development in the Green Belt. The development is therefore harmful to the Green Belt, contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (including the accompanying Government Guidance 'Planning Policy for Traveller sites'), Policy 7.16 of the London Plan (2016), Policy EM2 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies OL1 and OL4 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Saved UDP Policies (November 2012) and Chapter 3, Paragraphs 3.18-3.20 of the Em",
    "The introduction of a residential use to the site and the siting of caravans and associated landscaping works, including an extensive area of hardstanding, together with the paraphernalia associated with a residential use would be detrimental to the character and appearance of the Countryside Conservation Area, contrary to the NPPF (2018), Policy 7.8 of the London Plan (2016) and Policy BE4 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Saved UDP Policies (November 2012).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Unitary Development Plan Saved Policies (September 2007) as incorporated into the Hillingdon Local Plan (2012) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including the London Plan (July 2011) and national guidance.",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant saved policies (referred to as policies from the Hillingdon Unitary Development Plan - Saved Policies September 2007), then London Plan Policies. On the 8th November 2012 Hillingdon's Full Council agreed the adoption of the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies. Appendix 5 of this explains which saved policies from the old Unitary Development (which was subject to a direction from Secretary of State in September 2007 agreeing that the policies were 'saved') still apply for development control decisions."
