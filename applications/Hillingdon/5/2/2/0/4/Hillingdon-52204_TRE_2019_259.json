    "Refused  - To fell and poison, One Ash, T130 and One Yew, T129 both on TPO 152",
    "Approved - To carry out tree surgery including to cut back branches to provide 2m clearance to property (number 22), One Horse Chestnut, T107, on TPO 152",
    "The Ash and Yew trees are situated within the rear garden and are visible from the Bayhurst Drive. They provide a green screen between the properties in Bayhurst Drive and those in Frithwood Avenue, The Ash being the prominent tree has a High Amenity value and the Yew which is partly obscured from view by other vegetation has a Low to medium Amenity value. The Horse Chestnut is situated between 20 and 22 Frithwood Avenue within the front garden, it can be seen from the side properties and the main road, and has a Medium Amenity value. All three trees contribute to the arboricultural character of Northwood (Frithwood) Conservation Area.",
    "With regard to the proposed felling of both the Ash (T130) and the Yew (T129), the reason provided for removal is to allow more light, this is not a sound arboricultural reason to remove trees. The Ash tree is covered in Ivy, the severing/ stripping of Ivy is exempt from the application process and doing so is likely to allow more light through the canop",
    "The length of the lateral limbs of the Horse Chestnut (T107) to be pruned shall be tip-reduced as per the approved specification. This work shall comprise a reduction in the length of the limb(s) in a uniform and systematic manner and the limb(s) should be cut back to suitably positioned secondary branches.",
    "The work shall result in a tree of typical form for the species and of balanced appearance. The level of limb reduction shall be expressed either as a percentage / length of the overall limb length to be removed, or as a level of clearance to be provided.",
    "The works shall be carried out in accordance with the recommendations contained in BS3998: 2010 - \"British Standard Recommendations for Tree Work\".  Climbing irons or 'spikes' shall not be used during the execution of the work.",
    "Reason",
    "In order to protect health of the tree and the visual amenity of the area.",
    "The removal of deadwood, dangerous / hanging branches and ivy:  This does not require the formal consent of the Council.",
    "Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981:  Note that it is an offence under this act to disturb roosting bats, nesting birds or any other protected species.  Therefore, if applicable, it is advisable to consult your tree surgeon / consultant to agree an acceptable time for carrying out the approved works.",
    "Owner(s)'s permission:  Permission should be sought from the owner(s) of the tree(s) and / or the owner(s) of the land that the tree(s) overhang prior to any approved work being carried out.",
    "Refusal of part of the requested works: The applicant retains a right of appeal against the part of the application that has effectively been refused (To fell and poison, One Ash, T130 and One Yew, T129 both on TPO 152).",
    "Expected standard of tree work: The approved works must be carried out in accordance with the conditions laid out above. If they are not, then enforcement action could being taken which could lead to prosecution and heavy fines. Therefore, it is highly recommended that the works are only carried out by a professional and competent arboriculturist who undertakes to comply with the conditions of this consent and in accordance with industry best practice (BS 3998:2010). The Arboricultural Association can provide details of its approved contractors, who have demonstrated such professionalism and competence, on their website (www.trees.org.uk) or by calling 01242 522152. Or on request the Council can provide a list of contractors who are known to carry out tree work to a good standard and to normally maintain an appropriate policy of indemnity insurance."
