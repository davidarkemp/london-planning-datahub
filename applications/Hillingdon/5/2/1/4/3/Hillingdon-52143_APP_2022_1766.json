The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policies BE1 HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012), Policies DMHB 3, DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two- Development Management Policies (2020), Policy HC1 of the London Plan and Chapters 12 and 16 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The proposed glazed balustrading by reason of its siting and proximity to the shared boundary, alongside the nature of the proposal, formalising a roof terrace area, would result in undue overlooking and would have a direct impact on the amenities of 150 and 154 Eastcote Road, resulting in a harmful loss of privacy, all contrary to the aims and requirements of Policy DMHB11 and DMHD1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan - Part Two (2020)."
