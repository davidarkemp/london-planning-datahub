  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed rear dormer extension, by virtue of its excessive size, width, height, bulk and massing, would appear as an insubordinate and incongruous form of development that would fail to respect the roof form and architectural composition of the host dwelling and would be harmful to the character and appearance of the surrounding area. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policies BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 1, DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2019).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2016). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020."
