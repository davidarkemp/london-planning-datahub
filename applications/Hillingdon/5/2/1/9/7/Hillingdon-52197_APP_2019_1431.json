    "All developments in a CDA area must contribute to managing the risk of flooding from surface water by reducing surface water runoff from their site. Therefore the applicant should minimise the water from the site entering the sewers. No drainage to support the extension or outbuilding should be connected to any existing surface water sewer, other than as an overflow. Water run off from any roof or hard paving associated with the development should be directed to a soakaway, or tank or made permeable. This includes any work to front gardens not part of the planning application, which must be permeable or be collected and directed to a permeable area, otherwise it would need an additional permission. A water butt should be incorporated."
