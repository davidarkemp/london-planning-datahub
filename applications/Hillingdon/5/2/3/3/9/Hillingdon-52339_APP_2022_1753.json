    "The proposed part single and two-storey side extension, by reason of its siting, combined height, width and depth, obtrusive design and lack of set backs from the established front building line and ridge height, would result in a disproportionate and visually intrusive form of overdevelopment that would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original dwelling, the adjacent and nearby similar styled properties along Frithwood Avenue of which it forms a part, character and appearance of the wider area and visual amenities of the streetscene and surrounding area. Therefore, the proposal would be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012), Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021), Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The proposed part single and part two-storey side extension and placement of windows, by reason of the siting, combined height, width and in particular depth beyond the neighbouring building of no.29 Frithwood Avenue, would result in overdominance, outlook, sense of enclosure, visual intrusion, overbearing impact, loss of daylight/sunlight and overlooking and loss of privacy to the occupies of no.27 and 29 Frithwood Avenue. Therefore, the proposal would be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012), Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "In the absence of a tree report and arboricultural implications assessment (to BS5837:2012), the proposal has failed to demonstrate that protected trees will be unaffected by the development proposals. Therefore, the proposal would be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012), PolicIES D3 and G7 of the London Plan (2021), Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 14 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The applicant has not submitted a Flood Risk Assessment and the application has failed to address the issues relating to flood risk and the proposal is therefore contrary to Policy EM6 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012), Policy DMEI 9 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy SI12 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2016). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. The Council's supports pre-application discussions.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
