    "The tree is located within the front garden of 27A Frithwood Avenue. It is a mature specimen currently in a poor to moderate condition.",
    "While its condition limits its overall contribution, it still provides a moderate level of amenity value, contributing to the arboreal character of the area and supporting the borough's wider green infrastructure. Its presence forms part of the established tree cover in the area.",
    "The application seeks consent to fell a mature tree which, based on the submitted photograph, appears to be in a state of decline. However, no supporting arboricultural evidence has been provided to demonstrate structural instability, internal decay, or imminent failure. There is no decay detection data, resistograph analysis, or professional report accompanying the request.",
    "While the tree does exhibit signs of reduced vitality, this alone does not justify removal under current policy. In line with the Hillingdon Tree Strategy, the Council does not support the removal of he",
    "The removal of deadwood, dangerous / hanging branches and ivy:  This does not require the formal consent of the Council.",

Therefore, if applicable, it is advisable to consult your tree surgeon / consultant to agree an acceptable time for carrying out the approved works.",
    "Owner(s)'s permission:  Permission should be sought from the owner(s) of the tree(s) and / or the owner(s) of the land that the tree(s) overhang prior to any approved work being carried out.",
    "Expected standard of tree work: The approved works must be carried out in accordance with the conditions laid out above. If they are not, then enforcement action could being taken which could lead to prosecution and heavy fines. Therefore, it is highly recommended that the works are only carried out by a professional and competent arboriculturist who undertakes to comply with the conditions of this consent and in accordance with industry best practice (BS 3998:2010). The Arboricultural Association can provide details of its approved contractors, who have demonstrated such professionalism and competence, on their website (www.trees.org.uk) or by calling 01242 522152. Or on request the Council can provide a list of contractors who are known to carry out tree work to a good standard and to normally maintain an appropriate policy of indemnity insurance."
