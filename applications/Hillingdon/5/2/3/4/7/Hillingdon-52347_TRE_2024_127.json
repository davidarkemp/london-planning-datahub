    "The removal of deadwood, dangerous / hanging branches and ivy:  This does not require the formal consent of the Council.",
    "Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981:  Note that it is an offence under this act to disturb roosting bats, nesting birds or any other protected species.  Therefore, if applicable, it is advisable to consult your tree surgeon / consultant to agree an acceptable time for carrying out the approved works.",
    "Statutory crown lifting of trees: This does not require formal consent of the Council if the clearance only involves the removal of branches to give a separation between the footway and the tips of the lowest branches by up to 2.3m or the carriageway by up to 5.2m.",
    "The medium-mature Cypress tree is in a fair condition and in the front of the property. It can be seen by other properties, footpath and road users. For these reasons it holds a moderate-high amenity value. It would be high if the tree had a fuller crown.",
    "Due to the moderate-high amenity value the specification to remove the tree is too severe. The suggestion to re-place with a native species would not be sufficient to cover the amenity, ecological and environmental factors of a 30 year old tree. The reports from a structural engineer suggests that the property has been built to co-exist with the current tree and the arboricultural impact assessment says that the tree has a further 30+ years life expectancy.",
    "Due to the amenity value, lack of perceived structural impact and life expectance of the tree this specification is not acceptable."
