    "The proposed raising of the eaves/roof height and the siting, number, size, scale, bulk and design of the dormer windows would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original and adjoining buildings and would be detrimental to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding Garden City, West Drayton Area of Special Local Character. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies BE1 and HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 1, DMHB 5, DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), Policies HC1, D4 and D6 of the London Plan (2020) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The proposed raising of the eaves/roof height, by virtue of its size, scale, bulk, height and proximity, would be detrimental to the amenities of the adjoining occupier at 8 Frays Avenue, by reason of overdominance, overshadowing, visual intrusion, loss of light and loss of outlook. Therefore, the proposal would be contrary to Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy D6 of the London Plan and paragraph 130(f) of the NPPF (2021).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2016). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020."
