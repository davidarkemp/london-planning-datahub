    "The tree(s) to be pruned shall be crown reduced by cutting back to 25-50 mm beyond previous points. Crown reduction shall not be construed as 'lopping' or 'topping' and shall result in a tree of typical form for the species and of balanced appearance.",
    "The previous pruning points / pollard heads shall be left intact and an appropriate number of live branches (which can be shortened) shall be left so that a natural-looking crown results.",
    "The works shall be carried out in accordance with the recommendations contained in BS 3998:2010 'Tree work - Recommendations'. Climbing irons or 'spikes' shall not be used during the execution of the work.",
    "REASON",
    "In order to protect health of the tree and the visual amenity of the area.",
    "The tree(s) to be pruned shall be crown thinned as per the approved specification / by a maximum of 20%.  This work shall comprise the removal of all dead, diseased, rubbing (if less than 25mm in diameter) and dangerous branches along with an amount of live, secondary branch growth, throughout the entire crown of the tree, up to the amount specified above.  Final pruning cuts shall be made at the branch collar and this shall be left intact.",
    "The amount of crown thinning shall be expressed as a percentage of the entire crown.  The works shall be carried out in accordance with the recommendations contained in BS 3998:2010 'Tree work - Recommendations'. Climbing irons or 'spikes' shall not be used during the execution of this work.  The result of this work shall be a tree of well-balanced appearance.",
    "REASON",
    "In order to protect health of the tree and the visual amenity of the area.",
    "The tree(s) to be pruned shall be crown lifted as per the approved specification . This work shall involve the tip reduction of low hanging branches and/or the removal of low branches to the height specified and result in a tree of balanced appearance; those branches to be removed shall be removed at their origin and all branch collars shall be left intact.",
    "The works shall be carried out in accordance with the recommendations contained in BS 3998:2010 'Tree work - Recommendations'. Climbing irons or 'spikes' shall not be used during the execution of this work.",
    "REASON",
    "In order to protect health of the tree and the visual amenity of the area.",
    "Crown reduction and/or crown reshaping:  Involves the overall reduction of the height and spread of a tree's crown, whilst, as far as possible, retaining its natural shape. It is advisable to retain smaller branches close to the pruning wounds to aid in the drawing up of water to the wounded tissue.",
    "Timing of works:  Pruning works should not be carried out during the period of bud burst and care should be taken to ensure that branches are cut back to healthy outward facing buds to avoid die-back to which some species are prone. For major works, such as pollarding or copping, work should only be carried out after the autumn leaf fall when the sap has gone down, and certainly well before the sap rises in the spring before bud burst has taken place.",
    "Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981:  Note that it is an offence under this act to disturb roosting bats, nesting birds or any other protected species.  Therefore, if applicable, it is advisable to consult your tree surgeon / consultant to agree an acceptable time for carrying out the approved works.",
    "Expected standard of tree work: The approved works must be carried out in accordance with the conditions laid out above. If they are not, then enforcement action could being taken which could lead to prosecution and heavy fines. Therefore, it is highly recommended that the works are only carried out by a professional and competent arboriculturist who undertakes to comply with the conditions of this consent and in accordance with industry best practice (BS 3998:2010). The Arboricultural Association can provide details of its approved contractors, who have demonstrated such professionalism and competence, on their website (www.trees.org.uk) or by calling 01242 522152. Or on request the Council can provide a list of contractors who are known to carry out tree work to a good standard and to normally maintain an appropriate policy of indemnity insurance."
