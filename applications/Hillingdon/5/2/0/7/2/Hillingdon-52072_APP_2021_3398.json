    "The proposed single storey side extension, in conjunction with the proposed garage conversion by virtue of its excessive scale, bulk and design, would appear disproportionate to the original dwelling and would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original property and would be detrimental to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the street scene and the wider area. The proposed use as an annexe would also not be acceptable as the annexe could be easily adapted to a fully self-contained unit. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and policies DMHB11, DMHB12 and DMHD1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan - Part Two (2020).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service."
