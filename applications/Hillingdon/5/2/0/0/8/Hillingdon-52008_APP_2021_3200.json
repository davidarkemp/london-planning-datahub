    "The proposed development by reason of its size, scale, bulk, massing and design would result in an incongruous and visually intrusive form of development that could not be considered to constitute subordinate additions to the existing dwellinghouse and the works would fail to respect the architectural composition of the existing dwellinghouse. The proposed development would also fail to harmonise with the established built environment on Blaydon Close resulting in a detrimental impact on the character and appearance of Blaydon Close. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012), Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two- Development Management Policies (2020) and Chapter 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "In the absence of a Tree Survey and Arboricultural Impact Assessment to BS5837:2012 standards, the application has failed to demonstrate that the development will safeguard existing trees on the site that are protected under a Tree Preservation Order (TPO 106) and further fails to demonstrate the protection and long-term retention of protected trees. The proposal is therefore detrimental to the visual amenity of the street scene and the wider area contrary to the requirements of Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 14 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020)."
