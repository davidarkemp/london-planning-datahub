    "The proposed development by reason of its size, scale, bulk, massing and design would result in an incongruous and visually intrusive form of development that could not be considered to constitute subordinate additions to the existing dwellinghouse and would fail to respect the architectural composition of the existing dwellinghouse. The proposed development would also fail to harmonise with the established built environment on Blaydon Close resulting in a detrimental impact on the visual amenity of the street scene and character and appearance of the area. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012), Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two- Development Management Policies (2020), Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021) and Chapter 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021)."
