  "description": "To fell two sycamores T4 and T5 on TPO 107",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "Both Sycamores are situated within the rear garden of 21 Morse Close, due to the layout of this close they can be seen both from the road as well approximately 20 gardens. As a result they have a combined Moderate to high amenity value and significantly contribute to the Arboreal character and amenity of Harefield Village Conservation Area.",
    "Both trees predate the development of Morse Close as a result their growth potential should have been considered during the planning process. It is evident from the applicant's photos that there is some decay within the T4's trunk however there is evidence of some occlusion around the wound and no evidence has been provided to confirm the extent of any internal decay. T5 is covered in Ivy, the severing of this is exempt from the TPO application process and if removed is likely to reduce resident's concerns about shadowing.",
    "Having regard to the reasons given for the proposed work, the work is unjustified and will have a detrimental impact on the vi",
    "The removal of deadwood, dangerous / hanging branches and ivy:  This does not require the formal consent of the Council."
