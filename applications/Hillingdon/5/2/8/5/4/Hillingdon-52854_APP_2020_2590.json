  "description": "Part single storey, part two storey rear extension and conversion of roof space to habitable use to include a rear dormer and 2 front rooflights",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed part two storey/part single storey rear extension, by reason of its siting in this siting in this visually prominent position, size, scale, bulk and design, including the introduction of a double hipped roof profile, would appear as a disproportionate and incongruous addition that would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original dwelling, and would be detrimental to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the surrounding area, and the wider Hillingdon Court Park Area of Special Local Character. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policies BE1 and HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 1, DMHB 5, DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), Policy 7.8 of the London Plan (2016) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2019).",
    "The proposed rear dormer, by reason of its siting in this visually prominent position, size, scale, bulk, and design, would fail to respect the original roof form and architectural composition of the original dwelling, and would be harmful to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the street scene and the wider Hillingdon Court Park Area of Special Local Character. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policies BE1 and HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 1, DMHB 5, DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), Policy 7.8 of the London Plan (2016) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2019).",
    "The proposed part two storey/ part single storey rear extension, by virtue of its scale, bulk, height and proximity, would have a harmful impact on the living conditions and external amenity space of the occupiers at number 27 Holm Grove, in terms of loss of outlook, sense of enclosure and overbearing effect. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policies BE1 and HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 1, DMHB 5, DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), Policy 7.8 of the London Plan (2016) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2019).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2016). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020."
