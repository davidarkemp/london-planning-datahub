  "description": "Single storey side extension",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed extension by reason of its size, scale, bulk, width and proximity to the side boundary, in conjunction with previous extensions, would fail to appear as subordinate addition, would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original dwelling, would result in the closing of an important gap characteristic to the area, resulting in a cramped appearance and would be detrimental to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service."
