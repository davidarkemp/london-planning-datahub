    "The proposed development, by reason of its size, scale, mass, bulk, depth and design would result in an overly dominant, cramped, excessive and incongruous form of development, which would engulf the original property and close an important gap to the detriment of the character, appearance and visual amenities of Coldharbour Lane. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012) and Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The proposed development, on account of its bulk, scale and depth, would have an overbearing impact on both Nos. 153 and 157 Coldharbour Lane  whilst new windows to the south elevation at 1st floor level would result in the perception of overlooking to the garden of No.153 Coldharbour Lane. Therefore on account of the impact on the amenities of both properties, the proposal is contrary to policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service. We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
