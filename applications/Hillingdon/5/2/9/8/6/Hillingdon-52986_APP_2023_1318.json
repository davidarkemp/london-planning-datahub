    "The proposed development does not constitute permitted development by virtue of the provisions of Schedule 2, Part 1, Class A of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015, as the enlarged part of the dwellinghouse (when combined with the existing projection) would extend beyond the rear wall of the original dwellinghouse by more than 4 metres. In addition, the enlarged part of the dwellinghouse (when combined with the existing projection) would also extend beyond a wall forming a side elevation of the original dwellinghouse and have a width greater than half the width of the original dwellinghouse. The proposal is therefore contrary to provisions A.1(g)(i), A.1(j)(iii) and A.1(ja) of Schedule 2, Part 1, Class A of the GPDO (2015) (as amended) and is therefore unlawful and refused."
