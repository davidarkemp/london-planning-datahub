    "The tree is an attractive oak and is visible to the public from Pastures Mead, giving it a moderate to",
    "high amenity value. The tree has an attractive crown and contributes to the arboreal character and",
    "amenity of the area.",
    "The crown lift to 6m is rejected on the grounds that this work would be too excessive and",
    "unnecessary. The crown reduction to the 3m points will take out approximately 30% of the crown -",
    "this is the maximum that would be acceptable for this tree at this time. Crown lifting the tree will",
    "increase this percentage and could have a negative effect on the recovery of the tree. Also, the 6m",
    "crown lift has been rejected on the grounds that this would remove some of the lower, large limbs,",
    "creating large pruning wounds, and increasing the chances of infection within the tree. The resulting",
    "form from a 6m crown lift will also be undesirable, creating a 'lollipop' shape. No arboricultural",

Therefore, if applicable, it is advisable to consult your tree surgeon / consultant to agree an acceptable time for carrying out the approved works.",
    "Owner(s)'s permission:  Permission should be sought from the owner(s) of the tree(s) and / or the owner(s) of the land that the tree(s) overhang prior to any approved work being carried out.",
    "Expected standard of tree work: The approved works must be carried out in accordance with the conditions laid out above. If they are not, then enforcement action could being taken which could lead to prosecution and heavy fines. Therefore, it is highly recommended that the works are only carried out by a professional and competent arboriculturist who undertakes to comply with the conditions of this consent and in accordance with industry best practice (BS 3998:2010). The Arboricultural Association can provide details of its approved contractors, who have demonstrated such professionalism and competence, on their website (www.trees.org.uk) or by calling 01242 522152. Or on request the Council can provide a list of contractors who are known to carry out tree work to a good standard and to normally maintain an appropriate policy of indemnity insurance.",
    "The tree(s) to be pruned shall be crown reduced by cutting back to 25-50 mm beyond previous points. Crown reduction shall not be construed as 'lopping' or 'topping' and shall result in a tree of typical form for the species and of balanced appearance.",
    "The previous pruning points / pollard heads shall be left intact and an appropriate number of live branches (which can be shortened) shall be left so that a natural-looking crown results.",
    "The works shall be carried out in accordance with the recommendations contained in BS 3998:2010 'Tree work - Recommendations'. Climbing irons or 'spikes' shall not be used during the execution of the work.",
