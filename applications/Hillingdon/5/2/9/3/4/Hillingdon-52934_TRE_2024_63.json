    "The oak tree is situated in the rear garden of 29 Ickenham Road. It is a large, mature oak with an attractive crown that can be partially viewed by neighbouring properties and the public on Ickenham Road and Kingsend. The tree helps to contribute to the arboreal character of the area and has a high amenity value.",
    "Permission has been refused for this proposal due to conflicting reasons for work in the application, and supporting evidence provided.",
    "The application form states the work is for safety reasons, but there is no health and safety report attached as supporting evidence. The supporting correspondence states that the applicant has received advice from the agent that the tree would benefit from a crown reduction and thin - this is not viewed as a valid arboricultural reason for a 4m crown reduction.",
    "A 4m crown reduction would have a detrimental impact on the visual amenity value, and would therefore need to be justified from a health and safety point of view.",
    "Having regard t",
    "The removal of deadwood, dangerous / hanging branches and ivy:  This does not require the formal consent of the Council.",
    "Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981:  Note that it is an offence under this act to disturb roosting bats, nesting birds or any other protected species.  Therefore, if applicable, it is advisable to consult your tree surgeon / consultant to agree an acceptable time for carrying out the approved works.",
    "Owner(s)'s permission:  Permission should be sought from the owner(s) of the tree and / or the owner(s) of the land that the tree overhangs prior to any approved work being carried out.",
    "Expected standard of tree work: The approved works must be carried out in accordance with the conditions laid out above. If they are not, then enforcement action could being taken which could lead to prosecution and heavy fines. Therefore, it is highly recommended that the works are only carried out by a professional and competent arboriculturist who undertakes to comply with the conditions of this consent and in accordance with industry best practice (BS 3998:2010). The Arboricultural Association can provide details of its approved contractors, who have demonstrated such professionalism and competence, on their website (www.trees.org.uk) or by calling 01242 522152. Or on request the Council can provide a list of contractors who are known to carry out tree work to a good standard and to normally maintain an appropriate policy of indemnity insurance."
