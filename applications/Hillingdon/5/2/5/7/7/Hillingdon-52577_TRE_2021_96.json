    "The Oak tree is situated at the bottom of 124 Sutton Court Road's rear garden. It is one of the last remaining Oak trees from the original Oak Wood Estate and can be seen from the school grounds as well as surrounding properties. As a result, it has a Moderate to High Amenity value and significantly contributes to the Arboricultural character of the local area.",
    "The tree is situated close to the boundary fence with 126 and overhangs the rear garden of 126 by more than the 2m stated by the applicant, as a result removal of the two lowest branches back to the main stem would unnecessarily introduce large wounds into the main stem, which would likely cause stress and lead to infection, affecting the trees long-term health; this would affect the safe useful life expectancy of the tree. Removal of these two branches would also lead to the removal of a significant portion of the trees lower canopy leading to a lopsided appearance. The applicant's reason for the work is that the tree is \"very",
