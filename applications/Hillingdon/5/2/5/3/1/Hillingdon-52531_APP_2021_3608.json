    "The proposed development, by virtue of its design, excessive size, width, bulk and massing, would appear as an insubordinate and incongruous form of development that would fail to respect the form and architectural composition of the host dwelling and would be harmful to the character and appearance of the surrounding area of special local character. The proposal therefore conflicts with Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One Strategic Policies (2012), Policies DMHB 5, DMHB 6, DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The proposed rear element, by virtue of its excessive size, width, bulk, depth, massing and proximity to the neighbouring boundary, would be detrimental to the amenities of the neighbouring occupiers at 7 Copse Wood Way, by reason of overdominance, overshadowing, visual intrusion and loss of outlook. The proposal therefore conflicts with Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHD 1, DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The siting of the proposed extensions in proximity to the existing trees is unacceptable. Upon completion of the work, three trees will be uncomfortably close to the building structure and windows. It is likely that there will be pressure from future occupants to carry out work to the trees which would impact on the landscape features and visual amenities of the area of special local character. The proposal therefore conflicts with Policies DMHB 5, DMHB 6, DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHB 14 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), and Policy G7 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "This is a reminder that Under the terms of the Planning Act 2008 (as amended) and Community Infrastructure Levy Regulations 2010 (as amended), should an application for appeal be allowed, the proposed development would be deemed as 'chargeable development' and therefore liable to pay the London Borough of Hillingdon Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and the Mayor of London's Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This would be calculated in accordance with the London Borough of Hillingdon CIL Charging Schedule 2014 and the Mayor of London's CIL Charging Schedule 2012. For more information on CIL matters please visit the planning portal page at: www.planningportal.gov.uk/planning/applications/howtoapply/whattosubmit/cil",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the Local Plan Part 1 and Local Plan Part 2. In addition further guidance was offered to the applicant by the case officer during the processing of the application to identify the amendments to address those elements of the scheme considered unacceptable which the applicant chose not to implement."
