  "description": "Single storey side extension, single storey front extension, porch to front and part two storey, part single storey rear extension",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed part two storey/part single storey rear extension, by reason of its size, scale, bulk and design, including the introduction of a double hipped roof profile, would appear as a disproportionate and incongruous addition that would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original dwelling, and would be detrimental to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the surrounding area. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHD 1, DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020) and the National Planning Policy Framework (February 2019).",
    "The proposed part two storey/part single storey rear extension, by virtue of its scale, bulk, height and proximity, would have a harmful impact on the living conditions and external amenity space of the occupiers at number 8 Lawson Gardens, in terms of loss of outlook, over dominance and overbearing effect. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policies DMHD 1 and DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020) and the National Planning Policy Framework (February 2019).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2016). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020."
