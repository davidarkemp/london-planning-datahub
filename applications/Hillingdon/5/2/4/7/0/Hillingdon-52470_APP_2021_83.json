  "description": "Two storey side/rear extension.",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposal, by reason of its overall size and proximity to the side boundary, would result in a closing of the visually open gap between it and the neighbouring property, 9 Narborough Close, giving rise to a cramped form of development, which would be detrimental to the visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area generally.  The proposal is therefore contrary to policies DMHD 1 and DMHB 11 and 12 of the Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020)",
    "The proposed extension, by virtue of its siting, bulk, scale, excessive width and design, in particular the roof profile(s) would fail to appear as a subordinate addition and would thus be detrimental to the character and appearance of the original house, the visual amenities of the street scene and the character and appearance of the wider area. The proposal would therefore be contrary to policies DMHD 1 and DMHB 11 and 12 of the Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020)",
    "The proposal, by virtue of its size, scale, bulk, depth and proximity, would be detrimental to the amenities of the adjoining occupiers at 9 and 11 Narborough Close, by reason of over-dominance, overshadowing, visual intrusion and loss of outlook. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to policies DMHD 1 and DMHB 11 of the Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020)",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the 'Saved' UDP 2007, Local Plan Part 1, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service."
