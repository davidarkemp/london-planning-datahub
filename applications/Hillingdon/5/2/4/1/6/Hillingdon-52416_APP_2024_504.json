    "The development hereby permitted shall be begun before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.",
    "REASON",
    "To comply with Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990",
    "The development hereby permitted shall not be carried out except in complete accordance with the the content of Cover Letter dated 26th February 2024 and the details shown on the submitted plans: 'Site Location Plan' Number BCC-TP-PL-D09-001 (dated November 2023); 'Proposed Site Plan' Number BCC-TP-PL-D07-002 (Rev.

    "REASON",
    "To ensure the development complies with the provisions of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012), Part 2 (2020) and the London Plan (2021).",
    "The hereby approved development shall not commence until details of access to the building entrances (to include ramped/level approaches, signposting, types and dimensions of door width and lobby openings) are submitted and approved by the Local Planning Authority, in order to ensure that the development meets the needs of people with disabilities. The approved facilities should be provided prior to the occupation of the development and shall be permanently retained as such thereafter.",
    "REASON",
    "To ensure an Accessible and Inclusive development for everyone in accordance with Policy D5 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "Cadent Gas Ltd own and operate the gas infrastructure within the area of the development. There may be a legal interest (easements and other rights) in the land that restrict activity in proximity to Cadent assets in private land. The applicant must ensure that the proposed works do not infringe on legal rights of access and or restrictive covenants that exist.",
    "If buildings or structures are proposed directly above the apparatus the development may only take place following diversion of the apparatus. The applicant should apply online to have apparatus diverted in advance of any works, by visiting cadentgas.com/diversions",
    "Prior to carrying out works, including the construction of access points, please register on www.linesarchbeforeudig.co.uk to submit details of the planned works for review, ensuring requirements are adhered to.",
    "Cadent may have a Deed of Easement on the pipeline, which provides a right of access for a number of functions and prevents change to existing ground levels and storage of materials. It also prevents the erection of permanent/temporary buildings, or structures. If necessary, Cadent will take action to legally enforce the terms of the easement.",
    "There is a possibility that there are some contaminating substances in the ground of the site. Our contaminated land record shows the site to be on a former contaminated land use identified as Works. It is therefore advised that persons working on site shall take basic precautions in relation to any contamination they may find. This advice is provided on the grounds of Health and Safety of the workers on site and to ensure the appropriate restoration of the site is done. Should there be any contamination identified during the development where there is a need for ground work once such works are complete to minimise risk to the occupants of the site."
