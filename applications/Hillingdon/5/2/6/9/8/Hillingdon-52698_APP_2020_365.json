    "The proposed front extension, by reason of its siting, size, scale, bulk, height and design would result in an incongruous and overly dominant addition which would be detrimental to the architectural composition of the existing building, the street scene, and would harm the character and appearance of the wider area. As such, the proposal would be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHD 1, DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The roof alteration/extensions, by reason of the hip to gable end roof design and the size, scale, bulk and design of the rear dormer window would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original semi-detached dwelling, would be detrimental to the character, appearance and symmetry of the pair of semi-detached houses of which it forms a part and to the visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policies DMHD 1 and DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way.

No pre-application advice was sought. However the applicant would have been aware of the previous reasons for refusal.",
