The proposal would therefore have a detrimental impact upon the character and appearance of the application site and the surrounding area contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "The proposed extension due to the scale, siting and design, and overall depth would result in the loss of outlook, visual intrusion, and loss of light to the occupiers of the neighbouring property at No.163 Beverley Road. The proposal would therefore cause harm to the residential amenity of this neighbouring property, contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020)."
