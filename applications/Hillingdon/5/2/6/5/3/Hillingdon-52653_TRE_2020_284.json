  "description": "To carry out tree surgery including a reduction to One Scots Pine, T1 on TPO 311",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The Scots Pine on the front boundary of 46 Bury Street, a busy trunk road through the borough, as a result this pine has a high amenity value. It significantly contributes to the Arboricultural character of Ruislip Village Conservation Area.",
    "The proposed work is vague as the applicant does not provide a specification for the amount of pruning required as a result it is likely that work will have a detrimental effect on the health of the tree. Branches from this tree do overhang the pavement slightly however they are above 2.3m (the statutory clearance height over a footpath) and as a result it is unclear why overhanging branches are an issue. Minimal pruning around the telephone lines is acceptable under an exemption to ensure phone connection to properties is not interrupted.",
    "Having regard to the reasons given for the proposed work, the work is unjustified and will have a detrimental impact on the visual amenity and arboreal character of the area.",
    "The removal of deadwood, dangerous / hanging branches and ivy:  This does not require the formal consent of the Council.",
    "Clearance of telephone wires: Work to free telephone wires / cables, by cutting back secondary and tertiary branches to provide up to 500 mm clearance between the wires / cables and tree branches (i.e. forming corridors through the canopy and thereby abating the nuisance) does not require the formal consent of the Council."
