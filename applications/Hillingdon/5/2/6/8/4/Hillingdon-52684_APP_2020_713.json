    "The proposed two storey and single storey side/rear extensions, by reason of their excessive size, scale, bulk, cumulative width, height and design, would fail to appear as subordinate additions and would thus fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original and adjoining dwellings. The proposal would therefore represent an overdevelopment of the site to the detriment of the character and appearance and visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area, contrary to Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The proposed two storey side and rear extension, by virtue of its size, scale, bulk and proximity, would be detrimental to the amenities of the adjoining occupier at 20 Watford Road by reason of visual intrusion, loss of outlook and loss of privacy. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2016). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020."
