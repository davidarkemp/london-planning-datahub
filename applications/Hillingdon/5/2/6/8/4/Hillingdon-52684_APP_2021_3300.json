    "The proposed part two storey part single storey side/rear extension, by reason of its excessive size, scale, bulk, cumulative width, height and design, would fail to appear as subordinate additions and would thus fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original and adjoining dwellings. The proposal would therefore represent an overdevelopment of the site to the detriment of the character and appearance and visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area, contrary to Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The proposed two storey side and rear extensions, by virtue of their size, scale, depth, bulk and proximity, would be detrimental to the amenities of the adjoining occupiers at 20 and 24 Watford Road by reason of visual intrusion, loss of outlook, loss of light and sense of enclosure. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
