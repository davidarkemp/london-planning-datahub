    "The development hereby permitted shall be begun before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.",
    "REASON: To comply with Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990.",
    "The development hereby permitted shall not be carried out except in complete accordance with the details shown on the submitted plans, numbers 506/P/1.3, 506/P/1.4, 506/P/1.7 and 506/P/1.10.",
    "REASON: To ensure the development complies with the provisions of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020), and the London Plan (2021).",
    "There is a possibility there may be some contaminating substances present in the ground. We have no information on the ground conditions. We would advise persons working on site to take basic precautions in relation to any contamination they may encounter. Precautions should be taken to minimise the mixing of any excavated material with clean shallow soils that are to remain on site.",
    "REASON: You are advised this development is on former developed land. The advice is provided on the grounds of Health and Safety of the workers on site and to ensure the appropriate restoration of the site once works are complete to minimise risk to the occupants of the site.",
    "No development shall take place until details of all materials and external surfaces to be used in the construction of the proposed development have been submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority. Thereafter the development shall be constructed in accordance with the approved details and be retained as such.",
    "Details should include information relating to make, product/type, colour and photographs/images.",
    "REASON: To ensure that the development presents a satisfactory appearance in accordance with Policy DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 (2020).",
    "No contaminated soils or other materials shall be imported to the site. All imported soils for landscaping purposes shall be clean and free of contamination. All imported soils shall be tested for chemical contamination, and the results of this testing shall be summarised in a report and submitted to the Local Planning Authority for approval.",
    "REASON: To ensure that the occupants of the development are not subject to any risks from soil contamination in accordance with Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 (January 2020) Policies - DMEI 11: Protection of Ground Water Resources and DMEI 12: Development of Land Affected by Contamination.",
    "Prior to the first use/operation of the development hereby permitted, an electric vehicle charging point capable of charging 2no. vehicles at the same time shall be installed and made available to serve the proposed parking spaces. Thereafter, the electric vehicle charging point shall be maintained and retained for as long as the development exists.",
    "REASON: To encourage sustainable means of transportation in compliance with Policy T6 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "The development shall only be used as a Remote Internal Temporary Storage Facility in relation to border control storage and handling of animals as detailed in the application. It shall not be used for any other purpose.",
    "REASON: The particular use/development has been justified in the Green Belt location and to accord with Policy DMEI 4 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 (January 2020).",
    "The existing planting and/or hedging on the boundary with Spout Lane North which screens the approved extension shall be maintained for so long as the development remains in existence to a minimum height of 2 metres for the full depth of the development hereby approved.  Any gaps which occur shall be filled with replacement planting of a similar size and species, or other boundary screening as agreed by the Local Planning Authority.",
    "REASON: To safeguard the visual amenities of the area and designated greenbelt in accordance with Policies DMHB 11 and DMEI 4 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 (January 2020), Policy G2 of the London Plan and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021)",
    "It should be noted that any advertisement(s) shown on the proposed plans which does not benefit from deemed consent as set out in the Town and Country Planning (Control of Advertisements) Regulations 2007, requires advertisement consent and a separate application should be submitted for those works."
