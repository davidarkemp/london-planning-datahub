  "description": "ERECTION OF A DETACHED GARAGE IN FRONT GARDEN.",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed detached garage, by reason of its size and siting, would appear as a prominent feature in the context of this part of the street scene, given the relatively open aspect of the front gardens.  The proposal would be out of keeping with this open character and the visual amenities of the street scene.  Furthermore, the granting of permission would establish a precedent for similar development that the Local Planning Authority would find difficult to resist, which if repeated, would further erode the spacious character of the street scene.  The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies BE13 and BE19 of the Borough's adopted Unitary Development Plan.",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
