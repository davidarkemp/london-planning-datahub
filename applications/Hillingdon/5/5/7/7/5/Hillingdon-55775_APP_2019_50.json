    "The proposed two storey rear extension, by reason of its size, design and proximity, would result in an overly dominant feature that overshadows the adjacent property at No.54 Great Benty, and as such would result in a visually intrusive and an un-neighbourly form of development, resulting in a material loss of outlook. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to policies BE19, BE20 and BE21 of the Hillingdon Unitary Development Plan (Saved Policies September 2007) and to the Council's Supplementary Planning Documents HDAS Residential Extensions.",
    "The proposal, by reason of its size, bulk, height, design and proximity, with inadequate separation distances between the proposed dwelling and the existing property, Number 120 Harmondsworth Road, would result in an overly dominant, visually intrusive and an un-neighbourly form of development, resulting in a material loss of residential amenity and privacy. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to policies BE20, BE22 and BE24 of the Hillingdon Unitary Development Plan (Saved Policies September 2007) and to the Council's Supplementary Planning Documents HDAS Residential Extensions.",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant saved policies (referred to as policies from the Hillingdon Unitary Development Plan - Saved Policies September 2007), then London Plan Policies (2016).  On the 8th November 2012 Hillingdon's Full Council agreed the adoption of the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies. Appendix 5 of this explains which saved policies from the old Unitary Development (which was subject to a direction from Secretary of State in September 2007 agreeing that the policies were 'saved') still apply for development control decisions.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. The Council's supports pre-application discussions.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
