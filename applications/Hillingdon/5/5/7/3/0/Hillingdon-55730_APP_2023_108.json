    "The proposal would result in the loss of a family sized dwelling and its replacement with 2no. substandard flats, thereby representing a loss of accommodation for which there is an identified need in the Borough and the provision of less desirable accommodation. The principle of the development is therefore contrary to the requirements of Policies DMH 1, DMH 2 and DMH 4 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021) and paragraph 130 (f) of the National Planning POlicy Framework (2021).",
    "The proposal, by reason of its layout and design, inadequate internal floorspace, reliance upon loft space, and as the original building has a floorspace of less than 120 sqm, would fail to provide an acceptable standard of amenity for their future residents, contrary to the requirements of Policies DMHB 16, DMH 1 and DMH 4 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021) and the Technical Housing Standards - Nationally Described Space Standard (2015) and paragraph 130 (f) of the National Planning POlicy Framework (2021).",
    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate that 75% of the Gross Internal Area of 'Flat 2' would have a minimum floor to ceiling height of 2.5m and in the absence of this detail, it is not possible to confirm that the proposal is not contrary to the requirements of Policy D6(8) of the London Plan (2021) and would not bring about a substandard level of accommodation contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan (Part One) 2012 and Policies DMHB 11, DMH 1 and DMH 4 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies 2020.",
    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate how the rear garden would be split into adequately sized private amenity space for the two flats, contrary to Policy DMHB 18 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020)",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service. We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
