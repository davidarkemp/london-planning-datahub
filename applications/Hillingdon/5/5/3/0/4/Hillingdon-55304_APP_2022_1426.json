    "The proposal does not comply with the requirements for planning, as set out in the Flood Risk and Coastal Change section of the planning practice guidance. The application does not adequately assess the development's impact on the bank and river. This application also goes against Policy DMEI 8 of Hillingdon's Local Plan, which states that a minimum of 8 metres must be provided between development and the top of the bank of a main river. The flood defence asset consists of timber camp shedding which is a facing of piles and boards along the riverbank to protect it from the action of the current, or to stop the bank from collapsing. Camp shedding as a flood defence is not like a hard engineered wall (which is more resistant), and so it provides little structural support for the riverbank, and therefore will not be able to support any additional weight such as the building. The development proposal therefore conflicts with Policy EM6 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1- Strategic Polici",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "In order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably. Additional information was submitted by the applicants however we have been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
