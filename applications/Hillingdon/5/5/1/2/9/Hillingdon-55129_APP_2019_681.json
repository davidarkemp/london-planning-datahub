    "The proposed two storey side, part single storey part two storey rear extension, by reason of their size, scale, bulk, proximity and staggered relationship with the adjacent properties would be detrimental to the amenities of the adjoining occupier at 55 and 57 Gainsborough Road by reason of overdominance, overshadowing, visual intrusion, loss of light and loss of outlook. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to policies BE19, BE20 and BE21 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Saved UDP Policies (November 2012), the Council's adopted Supplementary Planning Document HDAS: Residential Extensions and Policy DMHD 2 of the Alterations and Extensions to Residential Dwellings of the London Borough Of Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 Development Management Policies with Modifications (March 2019).",
