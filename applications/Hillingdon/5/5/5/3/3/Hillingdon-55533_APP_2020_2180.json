  "description": "Two storey front extension (fronting Cordingley Road), single storey rear extension and addition of car parking space and a electric vehicle charger.",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The two storey extension would appear as an unduly prominent and inharmonious addition on the front elevation of the existing property, and would appear as an incongruous feature within the context of the street scene along Cordingley Road, with the introduction of cat slide roof form and a facade which lacks appropriate detail, particularly at ground floor level. It is considered that the extension would be harmful to the architectural composition of the existing property and the visual amenities of the street scene and surrounding area, contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "As presented, the parking element of the proposal fails to accord with the Council's 'Domestic Vehicle Footway Crossover' (DVFC) 2019 Policy guidance in that a crossover will only be approved where a standard car parking space (2.4m wide x 4.8m deep) at 90 degrees to the highway can be accommodated on the front garden/ forecourt of an application site. In addition a vehicle must be able to leave the space at a right angle to the kerb. As such, the use of the proposed parking space would result in vehicular and pedestrian conflict on the adjoining public footway, prejudicial to conditions of general highway and pedestrian safety, contrary to Policies DMT 2 and DMT 6 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal.",
    "The applicant is advised that with any re-submission, appropriate notice would need to be served on all those who had an interest in all the land to which the application relates (it is noted that the current application site includes and involves landscaping work to a footpath which runs along the side of the property, adjacent to the car park and that from the application form, it is claimed that the applicant has sole rights to the land)."
