  "description": "Erection of a building to incorporate 5 x 2-bed self contained flats with parking and landscaping involving demolition of existing bungalow (Outline application with all matters reserved)",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The application has not demonstrated that the development of 5 x 2 bedroom flats would not give rise to an over-intensive use of the site with a site coverage and form of development which would be out of keeping with and detrimental to the character of the area and the street scene on Corwell Lane and Harlington Road. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan - Part Two (2020) and Policies 3.5 and 7.4 of the London Plan.",
    "The application has not demonstrated that the development of 5 x 2 bedroom flats would not give rise to an over-intensive use of the site with a site coverage and form of development which would not allow for sufficient landscaping or for the provision of a sufficiently high quality area of external amenity space in conflict with policies DMHB 14 and DMHB 18 of the Hillingdon Local Plan - Part Two (2020).",
    "The application has not demonstrated that the development of 5 x 2 bedroom flats would not, by reason of the siting of the proposed car parking in relation to the adjoining property at 78 Corwell Lane, constitute an unneighbourly form of development resulting in an unacceptable loss of amenity by way of noise and disturbance. The proposal is therefore contrary to  Policy DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan - Part Two (2020).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan - The Spatial Development Strategy for London consolidated with alterations since 2011 (2016) and national guidance.",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2016). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the 'Saved' UDP 2007, Local Plan Part 1, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service. This is a resubmission of a previously refused scheme, where the Inspectors Report identified issues to be addressed, which were reflected in the reasons for refusal, allowing the opportunity to address those issues within this submission. The applicant has also been given advice through the Council's pre-application service."
