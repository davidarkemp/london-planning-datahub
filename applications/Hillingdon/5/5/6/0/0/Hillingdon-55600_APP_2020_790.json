    "The roof alteration/extensions, by reason of the siting, size, scale, bulk, and design of the dormer windows would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original dwelling and would be detrimental to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the street scene and the wider area. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
