  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed part single; part two storey side extension, by reason of its close siting, combined height, width, depth, scale and proximity would be detrimental to the amenities of the adjacent occupiers of no.9 Tayfield Close, in terms of overdominance, overshadowing, visual intrusion, overbearing impact, loss of daylight/sunlight and loss of outlook. Therefore, the proposal would be contrary to Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The proposed part single; part two-storey side extension, by reason of its siting, combined height, width, depth and design would result in a dominant and visually harmful addition that would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original dwelling, would unbalance the relationship with the adjacent properties of the cul-de-sac, and would be detrimental to the character and appearance of the surrounding area. Therefore, the proposal would be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012) and Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The proposed single storey side/rear extension by reason of the combined height, width and excessive depth, including design would result in a dominant, visually intrusive and disproportionate addition that would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original dwelling, to the detriment of the character and appearance of the surrounding area. Therefore, the proposal would be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012) and Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The proposal would result in an unacceptable reduction in the quantum of private external amenity space associated with the application property, resulting in a substandard form of accommodation, contrary to Policies DMHD 1 and DMHB 18 of the Hillingdon Local Plan - Part 2 Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2021). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020."
