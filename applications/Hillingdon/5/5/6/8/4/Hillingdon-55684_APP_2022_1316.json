    "In the absence of accurate plans, it has not been possible to clarify the relationship of the proposed side extension on the residential amenities of the occupants of adjoining 38 Russell Gardens which appears to have an amenity space and side facing window in close proximity to the proposed extension which would be obstructed. As such the applicant has failed to satisfactorily demonstrate that the proposed extension would not result in an undue loss of light and outlook to the occupants of 38 Russell Gardens in conflict with Policy DMHB11 of the Hillindon Local Plan - Part Two and Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "In order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably. In addition further guidance was offered to the applicant by the case officer during the processing of the application to identify the amendments to address those elements of the scheme considered unacceptable which the applicant chose not to implement."
