    "The development, by virtue of the loss of the existing family dwellings, would conflict with the Borough's strategic housing goal of safeguarding 3-bedroom family dwellings and the proposed change of use to a Large HMO would be harmful to the character of the area and consequently, the principle of development is considered to be unacceptable. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies DMH 1, DMH 5, DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2023).",
    "The development, by virtue of the excessive size, scale and bulk of the proposed dormers, coupled with the increase in the height of the roof ridge, would appear as a top heavy, insubordinate and incongruous form of development that significantly detracts from the scale, proportions and architectural composition of the original buildings and causes harm to the character and appearance of the surrounding area. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One- Strategic Policies (2012), Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2023).",
    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate that the proposal and the high number of potential occupants, would not result in noise and general disturbance to neighbouring properties alongside a harmful over intensification of the use of the site, detrimental to both the occupiers and neighbouring properties and the residential amenity of the area. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies DMH 5, DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policies D3 and D13 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2023).",
    "The development, by virtue of its failure to maintain an adequate amount of private amenity space and usable internal living space for the occupiers of the proposed development, would result in substandard living accommodation and an over-development of the site to the detriment of the residential amenity of future occupiers. The development is therefore contrary to the requirements of Policies DMH 5, DMHB 11 and DMHB 16 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2023).",
    "The development would fail to provide adequate safe and accessible parking provision which would increase parking stress in a controlled parking zone; would prejudice highway safety; and would fail to encourage sustainable modes of transport including cycling, walking and the use of public transport. The development is therefore contrary to Policies DMT 1, DMT 2, DMT 5 and DMT 6 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policies T2, T4, T6 and T6.1 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2023).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2021). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal.",
    "This is a reminder that Under the terms of the Planning Act 2008 (as amended) and Community Infrastructure Levy Regulations 2010 (as amended), should an application for appeal be allowed, the proposed development would be deemed as 'chargeable development' and therefore liable to pay the London Borough of Hillingdon Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and the Mayor of London's Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This would be calculated in accordance with the London Borough of Hillingdon CIL Charging Schedule 2014 and the Mayor of London's CIL Charging Schedule 2012.
