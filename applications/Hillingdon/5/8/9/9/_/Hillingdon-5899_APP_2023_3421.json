    "The rear dormer roof extension and hip to gable end roof enlargement, in combination with the existing first floor rear extension by reason of its design, scale, bulk and siting would appear obtrusive within the street scene which will have a detrimental impact on the character and appearance of the surrounding area. Consequently, the roof alterations are considered to introduce unsympathetic additions to the host dwelling that would have an adverse cumulative impact on the character and appearance of the wider area and this form of development is not characteristic in the local area. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policies BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), Policy D4 of the London Plan (2021) and the NPPF 2023.",
    "The proposed single storey rear extension, by reason of its cumulative size, design and proximity to the shared boundary, would result in an overly dominant feature that is incongruous with the prevailing pattern of development, resulting in harm to the character of the area, and would harm the residential amenities of the adjoining property at No.16 Bridge Way, through loss of light to and outlook from this property, and through creating an overbearing sense of enclosure. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to policies DMHB11 and DMHD1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan - Part Two (2020).",
