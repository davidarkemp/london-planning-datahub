  "description": "Single storey front extension and single storey rear extension with internal alterations",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed front extensions, by reason of its size, scale, depth and design, would fail to appear as a subordinate addition and would thus represent a visually unsympathetic form of development that fails to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original dwelling and would be detrimental to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the street scene and the wider area. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The proposed front extension, by reason of its size, scale, depth and proximity, would be detrimental to the amenities of the adjoining occupier at 3 The Croft by reason of overdominance, overshadowing, visual intrusion, loss of light and loss of outlook. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "The submitted plans show that both the front and rear extensions encroach across the shared boundary with no. 3. This would fall outside of the red outline identifying the extent of the site and is outside the ownership of the applicant, thereby invalidating the signed Certificate A. Had all aspects of the proposal been acceptable, revised plans/Certificate would have been required. Any re-submission should have regard to this."
