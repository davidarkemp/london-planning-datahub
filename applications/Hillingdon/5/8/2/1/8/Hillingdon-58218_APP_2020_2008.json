  "description": "Conversion of roof space to habitable use to include a rear dormer and conversion of roof from hip to gable end to allow conversion of dwelling to 1 x 1 bed self-contained flat and 1 x 2 bed self-contained flat  with associated parking and amenity space",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The development would lead to the unacceptable subdivision and loss of a small single family dwelling for which there is an established need in the Borough. The development would therefore be contrary to policy DMH 4 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "The roof alteration/extensions, by reason of the hip to gable end roof design and the size, scale, bulk, and design of the rear dormer window would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original semi-detached dwelling, would be detrimental to the character, appearance and symmetry of the pair of semi-detached houses of which it forms a part and to the visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "The proposed development, by virtue of its failure to provide accessible private amenity space of appropriate quality in relation to the first floor flat would be detrimental to the residential amenity of future occupiers. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies DMHB 11 and DMHB 18 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "The proposed development, by virtue of its failure to provide private amenity space in an appropriate location would result in loss of privacy to the occupants of the proposed ground floor flat harmful to their residential amenity. The development is therefore contrary to Policies DMHB 11 and DMHB 18 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020) and Policy 3.5 of the London Plan (2016).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan - The Spatial Development Strategy for London consolidated with alterations since 2011 (2016) and national guidance."
