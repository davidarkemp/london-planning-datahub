    "The proposed development, by reason of the provision of facilities within and by having an access which is capable of being used independently, is considered capable of independent occupation from the main dwelling. As a result, the proposal would be tantamount to a separate self-contained residential unit in a position where such a dwelling would be unacceptable, due to being out of keeping with the pattern of surrounding development and requirements for parking, living accommodation and amenity space and the impact on adjoining properties. The proposal is, therefore, contrary to Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 16, DMHB 18, DMT 6 and DMHD 2 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020)."
