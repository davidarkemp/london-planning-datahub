    "The proposed two storey side extension, by virtue of its flat roof design, including the lack of a set back from the front return building line at all levels, would result in an incongruous form of development that would not appear as a subordinate addition to the original dwellinghouse and would thus fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original semi-detached dwelling.  The proposed development would also be detrimental to the character, appearance and symmetry of the pair of semi-detached houses of which it forms a part and to the visual amenities of the street scene on Minet Drive and Showers Way and the adjoining East & West Walk, Botwell Area of Special Local Character. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 5, DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "The proposed two storey extension by reason of its size, scale, bulk, height, width and projection forward of the return building line along Showers Way, in this open prominent position, would result in the closing of an important gap characteristic to the area, resulting in a cramped appearance. The proposal would therefore represent an overdevelopment of the site to the detriment of the visual amenities of the street scene and the character and appearance of the surrounding area. The proposed development is therefore contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies.",
    "The proposed development, by reason of its provision of a separate interal staircase and the availability of independent access to it, is considered capable of independent occupation from the main dwellinghouse.  As a result, the proposal would be tantamount to the creation of a separate self-contained residential unit  in a position where such a dwelling would be unacceptable due to requirements for parking and amenity space and the impact on adjoining properties. The proposal therefore conflicts with Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 16,  DMHB 18, DMT 2 and DMT 6 of the  Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policies D6 and T6 of the London Plan (2021) and paragraphs 109 and 127 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2019) .",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. The Council's supports pre-application discussions. We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
