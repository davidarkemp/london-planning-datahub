    "The proposed development, by virtue of its excessive, scale, bulk and inappropriate design details, would be detrimental to the character, appearance and visual amenity of the host dwelling, the street scene and the Hillside, Northwood Hills Area of Special Local Character. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies BE1 and HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012); Policies DMHB 1, DMHB 5, DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020); Policies D3 and D6 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2019).",
    "The proposed rear extensions, by reason of  their excessive scale, bulk, design and proximity, would result in an overly dominant feature that overshadows the adjoining properties at Nos. 66 and 70 Hillside Road and as such would result in a visually intrusive and un-neighbourly form of development, leading to a loss of light and a material loss of residential amenity Therefore the proposal would be contrary to policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan - Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The proposed development could increase groundwater flood risk contrary to Policy EM6 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1- Strategic Policies (Nov 2012); Policies DMEI 9 and DMHD 3 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2: Development Management Policies (2020); the National Planning Policy Framework (2019); and Planning Practice Guidance (Flood Risk and Coastal Change)."
