  "description": "Erection of a 2-bed bungalow with associated parking and amenity space",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed development, by reason of its siting (in a rear garden), layout, and site coverage, would result in a cramped development of the site, which is visually incongruous (given the setting) and would fail to harmonise with the existing local and historic context of the surrounding area. The principle of intensifying the residential use of the site to the level proposed, would have a detrimental impact on the visual amenity, appearance and character of the street scene and the surrounding area contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMH 6 and DMHB 11 of the emerging Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies  (Jan 2020), Policies 3.5, 7.1 and 7.4 of the London Plan, guidance within The London Plan Housing Supplementary Planning Guidance (November 2016) and the NPPF.",
    "The proposal, by reason of the siting of the bedroom and dining room windows, given their proximity to the boundary would result in the provision of habitable rooms with no/very little outlook and very limited levels of natural lighting that would result in a substandard form of living accommodation and reliance upon artificial means of lighting which would fail to satisfy sustainability and energy efficiency objectives and would be to the detriment of the amenity of future occupiers, contrary to Policies 3.5 and 5.3 of the London Plan (March 2016) and Policy DMHB 11 of the  Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (Jan 2020).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan - The Spatial Development Strategy for London consolidated with alterations since 2011 (2016) and national guidance.",
    "This is a reminder that Under the terms of the Planning Act 2008 (as amended) and Community Infrastructure Levy Regulations 2010 (as amended), should an application for appeal be allowed, the proposed development would be deemed as 'chargeable development' and therefore liable to pay the London Borough of Hillingdon Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and the Mayor of London's Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This would be calculated in accordance with the London Borough of Hillingdon CIL Charging Schedule 2014 and the Mayor of London's CIL Charging Schedule 2012.
