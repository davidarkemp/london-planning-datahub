    "The proposed development by reason of its size, scale, bulk and design, in this open prominent position would result in the closing, of an important gap characteristic to the area, resulting in a cramped appearance. The proposal therefore represents an overdevelopment of the site to the detriment of the character and visual amenities of the area and to this existing open area of the street scene. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies.",
    "In the absence of a Flood Risk Assessment in accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework and National Planning Practice Guidance, the application has failed to address the issues relating to flood risk and the proposal is therefore contrary to Policy EM6 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policy DMEI 9 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies, Policy SI12 of the London Plan (2021) and the NPPF.",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant saved policies (referred to as policies from the Hillingdon Unitary Development Plan - Saved Policies September 2007), then London Plan Policies (2016). On the 8th November 2012 Hillingdon's Full Council agreed the adoption of the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies. Appendix 5 of this explains which saved policies from the old Unitary Development (which was subject to a direction from Secretary of State in September 2007 agreeing that the policies were 'saved') still apply for development control decisions."
