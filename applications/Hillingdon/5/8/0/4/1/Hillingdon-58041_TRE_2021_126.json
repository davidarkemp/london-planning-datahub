    "Approved - To carry out tree surgery, to remove all branches overhanging 9 Hilliers Avenue back to the trunk to One Lime, T34 on TPO 87",
    "Refused  - To carry out tree surgery, to remove all branches overhanging 9 Hilliers Avenue back to the trunk to One Holm Oak, T29 on TPO 87",
    "The length of the lateral limbs of the Lime tree to be pruned shall be tip-reduced as per the approved specification . This work shall comprise a reduction in the length of the limb(s) in a uniform and systematic manner and the limb(s) should be cut back to suitably positioned secondary branches.",
    "The work shall result in a tree of typical form for the species and of balanced appearance. The level of limb reduction shall be expressed either as a percentage / length of the overall limb length to be removed, or as a level of clearance to be provided.",
    "The works shall be carried out in accordance with the recommendations contained in BS3998: 2010 - \"British Standard Recommendations for Tree Work\".  Climbing irons or 'spikes' shall not be used during the execution of the work.",
    "Reason",
    "In order to protect health of the tree and the visual amenity of the area.",
    "The removal of deadwood, dangerous / hanging branches and ivy:  This does not require the formal consent of the Council.",
    "Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981:  Note that it is an offence under this act to disturb roosting bats, nesting birds or any other protected species.  Therefore, if applicable, it is advisable to consult your tree surgeon / consultant to agree an acceptable time for carrying out the approved works.",
    "Owner(s)'s permission:  Permission should be sought from the owner(s) of the tree(s) and / or the owner(s) of the land that the tree(s) overhang prior to any approved work being carried out.",
    "Expected standard of tree work: The approved works must be carried out in accordance with the conditions laid out above. If they are not, then enforcement action could being taken which could lead to prosecution and heavy fines. Therefore, it is highly recommended that the works are only carried out by a professional and competent arboriculturist who undertakes to comply with the conditions of this consent and in accordance with industry best practice (BS 3998:2010). The Arboricultural Association can provide details of its approved contractors, who have demonstrated such professionalism and competence, on their website (www.trees.org.uk) or by calling 01242 522152. Or on request the Council can provide a list of contractors who are known to carry out tree work to a good standard and to normally maintain an appropriate policy of indemnity insurance.",
    "The lime tree is situated within the rear garden of 7 Hillier Avenue and can be seen from multiple properties on Uxbridge Road and Harlington Road as a result it has a Moderate to high amenity Value. The Holm Oak is situated within the rear garden of Whitefriars, Uxbridge Road and can also be seen from the forementioned roads as well as Hilliers Avenue as a result it has a High amenity Value. Both trees significantly contribute to the local biodiversity and arboreal character of the area. The benefit in amenity and biodiversity afforded by trees is both present and future because they have the potential for a long life expectancy.",
    "With regards to the proposed pruning of growth overhanging 9 Hilliers Avenue back to the trunk of the Holm Oak, this Oak is situated close to the boundary line as a result the proposed works would remove half of the tree's canopy, leaving it very lopsided. This would unnecessarily introduce large multiple wounds into its crown, which would likely cause stress"
