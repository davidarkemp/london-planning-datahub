    "The proposed single storey side and rear extension and first floor side and rear extension, by virtue of its combined design, scale, height and massing including the squat roof design and wraparound design of the first floor side and rear extension, would result in a boxy, bulky, visually intrusive, disproportionate, incongruous, dominant, and overbearing addition that would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original dwelling, relationship with no.96 and 100 Manor Way, visual amenities of the streetscene and would fail to preserve or enhance the character and appearance of the Ruilsip, Manor Way Conservation Area.  Therefore,  the proposal would be contrary to Policies HC1, D1 and D3 of the London Plan (2021). Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012), Policies DMHB 4, DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and Sections 12 and 16 of the National Planning Po",
    "The proposed first floor side/rear extension, by virtue of its close siting, combined height, width, depth, bulk and massing would give rise to unacceptable loss of outlook, overbearing impact, visual intrusion, sense of enclosure and some loss of daylight/sunlight to the occupiers at no.100 Manor Way. Therefore, the proposal would be contrary to Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2021). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020."
