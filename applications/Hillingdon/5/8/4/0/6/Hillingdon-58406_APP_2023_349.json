    "The proposed development due to its design, including a second door on the front elevation, in combination with the materials, flat roof appearance of the front elevation and boundary treatment would be visually incongruous and fail to respect the architectural integrity of the host building and the group value shared with its neighbours, harming the character and appearance of the street scene and surrounding area. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policies BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The development to convert the garage would result in the loss of parking. The application fails to demonstrate that two parking spaces could be provided on the site. As such, the proposal would result in additional on-street parking in a location which would cause unacceptable harm to highway and pedestrian safety and would be detrimental to the visual amenity of the street scene and the wider area. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policy DMT 6 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two Development Management Policies (2020) and PolicyT6.1 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
