    "The proposed single storey side element, by reason of its combined roof design, height, bulk and mass would result in an excessive, bulky, dominant, incongruous, visually intrusive, disproportionate, overbearing and discordant addition that would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original dwelling, the symmetry with the attached semi-detached property at 5 Hoylake Crescent and would be detrimental to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the street scene on Hoylake Crescent.  Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012) and Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2016). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020.",
    "You are reminded that whilst the submitted plans show unauthroised works undertaken to the roof of the dwelling, in particular the front, this does not mean these elements have been considered as part of the assessment of this planning application. The works described are set out within the Decision Notice."
