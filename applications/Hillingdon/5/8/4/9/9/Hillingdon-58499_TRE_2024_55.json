    "Within the application, the applicant provided a covering letter from All Seasons Tree Services Ltd. outlining two options for potential tree work, as described above.",
    "On 08/02/2024, an application (58499/TRE/2023/299) was rejected for a 30% crown reduction on the grounds that the work was excessive and would introduce multiple large pruning wounds to the tree. Comments were made within the Officers Report that we would be more open to a reduction on one or more limbs that are closest to the property to help alleviate the issues caused.",

If they are not, then enforcement action could being taken which could lead to prosecution and heavy fines. Therefore, it is highly recommended that the works are only carried out by a professional and competent arboriculturist who undertakes to comply with the conditions of this consent and in accordance with industry best practice (BS 3998:2010). The Arboricultural Association can provide details of its approved contractors, who have demonstrated such professionalism and competence, on their website (www.trees.org.uk) or by calling 01242 522152. Or on request the Council can provide a list of contractors who are known to carry out tree work to a good standard and to normally maintain an appropriate policy of indemnity insurance.",
