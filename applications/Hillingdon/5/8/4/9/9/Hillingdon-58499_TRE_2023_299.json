    "The oak is situated in the front garden of 30 Clovelly Close, Pinner. It appears to be in good health and is a mature, prominent tree in the area. The tree can be viewed from properties and publicly accessible land on Chamberlain Way, Burlington Close, and from the rear of some of the properties on Tolcarne Drive. Whilst there is some evidence of past reduction work to the tree, the crown is attractive and can be seen from various different perspectives.",
    "A 30% reduction for this tree is considered excessive and would introduce multiple large pruning wounds. The tree is situated close to the property, there is scope for some pruning works to ensure the branches do not come into contact with the property in the future. A new application would be needed for this, and the resident may wish to discuss the specifications for this with an Arboricultural Consultant prior to submitting a new application to assist with preparing the specification.",

If they are not, then enforcement action could being taken which could lead to prosecution and heavy fines. Therefore, it is highly recommended that the works are only carried out by a professional and competent arboriculturist who undertakes to comply with the conditions of this consent and in accordance with industry best practice (BS 3998:2010). The Arboricultural Association can provide details of its approved contractors, who have demonstrated such professionalism and competence, on their website (www.trees.org.uk) or by calling 01242 522152.
