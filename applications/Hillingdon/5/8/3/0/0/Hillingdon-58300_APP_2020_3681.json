  "description": "Part two storey, part single storey rear extension, first floor side extension and change of roof profile including demolition of existing porch and rear extension",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed part two storey, part single storey side extension, by reason of its siting in close proximity to the side boundary, its size, scale, bulk, and design, including the loss of the characteristic the cat-slide roof form along the flank elevation, would constitute an unsympathetic and discordant addition, which would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original semi-detached dwelling, would be detrimental to the character, appearance and symmetry of the pair of semi-detached houses of which it forms a part and to the visual amenities of the street scene and the wider East and West Walk Area of Special Local Character. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to BE1 and HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 1, DMHB 5, DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), Policy 7.8 of the London Plan (2016) and the National Planning Policy Frame",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2016). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020."
