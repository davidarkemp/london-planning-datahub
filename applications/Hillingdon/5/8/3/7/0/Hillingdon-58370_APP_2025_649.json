    "The proposed development by reason of the excessive hip to gable conversion, overly large rear dormer, and conversion of the two-storey rear extension to an incongruous flat roof, would be unduly prominent, visually incongruous, and unsympathetic to the original architectural composition of the host dwelling, resulting in a detrimental impact on the character and appearance of the original dwelling that would be out of keeping with the character and appearance of the immediate street scene and surrounding area. The proposal thereby fails to comply with Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021), Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One- Strategic Policies (2012), and Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The proposed development, by reason of the lack of direct outlook for the new bedroom in the roof conversion, would result in substandard living conditions that would harm the residential amenity of future occupiers of the site. The proposal thereby fails to comply with Policies D3 and D6 of the London Plan (2021) and Policy DMHB 16 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan (2021) and national guidance."
