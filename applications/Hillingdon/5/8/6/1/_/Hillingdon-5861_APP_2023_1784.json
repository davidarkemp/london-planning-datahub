    "The proposed hip to gable end extension and rear dormer in conjunction with the existing extensions to the dwelling, by reason of the uncharacteristic roof transition, combined height, width and depth of the roof works and bulk, size, scale and poor design of both the roof conversion and rear dormer, would result in a top heavy, boxy, dominant, visually intrusive and incongruous form of overdevelopment that would fail to read as subordinate and successfully with the architectural composition of the original semi-detached dwelling, negatively impact the relationship with the adjacent No.52 Dale Drive. This is detrimental to the character and appearance of the area and visual amenities of the street scene contrary to Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021), Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012) and Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",

We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
