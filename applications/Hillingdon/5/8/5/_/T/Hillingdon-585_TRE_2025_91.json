Therefore, if applicable, it is advisable to consult your tree surgeon / consultant to agree an acceptable time for carrying out the approved works.",
    "Statutory crown lifting of trees: This does not require formal consent of the Council if the clearance only involves the removal of branches to give a separation between the footway and the tips of the lowest branches by up to 2.3m or the carriageway by up to 5.2m.",
    "The trees are situated in an open space on a grass verge next to the roads. They are mature, in good condition and have good form. They can be seen by nearby properties as well as road and footpath users. For these reasons they have a high amenity value.",
    "Due to the trees amenity value the specification of work would need to be much less severe than has been provided to avoid long term damage to the trees health and vitality. There would also need to be solid reasoning for the specification of work which has not been provided.",
    "The application is refused due to the lack of reasoning behind the specifications as well as the severity of the specifications."
