  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed development, by reason of its siting in this open prominent position, size, scale, bulk, height and design would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original building and would be detrimental to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the street scene, the surrounding area and the setting of the Grade ii Listed buildings opposite (11-25 Hillingdon Hill). The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy BE1 and HE1  of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 1, DMHB 2, DMHB 11 and DMHB 21 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), Policy 7.8 of the London Plan (2016) and the National Planning Policy Framework (February 2019).",
    "The proposed development, by virtue of its size, scale, bulk and proximity would be detrimental to the amenities of the adjoining occupiers at 2-18 Churchill Road and 2-8 Lacey Grove, by reason of visual intrusion and loss of outlook. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policies DMHB 11 and DMHB 21 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan - The Spatial Development Strategy for London consolidated with alterations since 2011 (2016) and national guidance.",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2016). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
