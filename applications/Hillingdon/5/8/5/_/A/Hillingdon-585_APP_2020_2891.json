  "description": "Demolition and replacement of roof structure (1.0 m higher eaves and ridge level), refurbishment and restoration of building including replacement windows and doors, to aid conversion of building to a single family dwelling house (Listed Building Application)",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed extension and alterations, by reason of loss of historic fabric would cause harm to the special architectural and historic interest of the Grade-II listed building. Furthermore, insufficient information has been provided to allow full consideration of the impact of the works on the listed building. In the absence of such, the proposals are considered to have a detrimental impact on the special architectural and historic interest of the building and are thereby contrary to the NPPF, Policy 7.8 of the London Plan (2016), Policies BE1 and HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 1 and DMHB 2 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The decision to REFUSE listed building consent has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE listed building consent has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Unitary Development Plan Saved Policies (September 2007) as incorporated into the Hillingdon Local Plan (2012) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan - The Spatial Development Strategy for London consolidated with alterations since 2011 (2016) and national guidance.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
