    "The application fails to demonstrate that two parking spaces could be provided without removing all of the soft landscaping to the front garden. As such, the proposal would result in additional on-street parking in a location which would cause unacceptable harm to highway and pedestrian safety and would be detrimental to the visual amenity of the street scene and the wider area. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policy DMT 6 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two Development Management Policies (2020) and PolicyT6.1 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "The proposed second door on the front elevation, in combination with the proportions and appearance of the front elevation would be visually incongruous and fail to respect the architectural integrity of the host building and the group value shared with its neighbours, harming the character and appearance of the street scene and surrounding area. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policies BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021)."
