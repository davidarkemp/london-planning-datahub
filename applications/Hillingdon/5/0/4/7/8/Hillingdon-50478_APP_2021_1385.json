    "The proposed development has failed to demonstrate that unacceptable levels of noise and disturbance to surrounding residential occupiers would not occur. In the absence of any noise surveys or noise mitigation measures providing evidence to the contrary, the proposed development is considered to result in noise and disturbance to the detriment of the amenity of adjoining occupiers, contrary to Policies  DMTC 4 and DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and Policy D14 of the London Plan (2021).",

    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan - The Spatial Development Strategy for London consolidated with alterations since 2011 (2016) and national guidance.",
