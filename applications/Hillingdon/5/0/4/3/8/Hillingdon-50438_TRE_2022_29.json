This Oak presents a mature and attractive crown, which is highly visible from properties in Clovelly Close and nearby properties in Chamberlain Way. This Oak has a high amenity value and makes a significant positive contribution to the local landscape, which is both present and future as the tree has the potential for a long-life expectancy.",
    "The Oak appears healthy and in good condition. The proposed work to reduce the crown by 4m would considerably lessen the height and spread of the appeal tree and consistently reduce its contribution to the character and appearance of the area.",
    "No arboricultural assessment has been supplied as evidence of the health of the tree showing that uncontrolled falls of timber are likely to occur, and justifying the need to remove 4m from the tree crown. The proposed work would make the tree appear excessively cut back, significantly damaging its amenity value and increasing the risk of",
