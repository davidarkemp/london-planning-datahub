  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed development does not constitute permitted development by virtue of the provisions of Schedule 2, Part 3, Class O of the  Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended) because Harrington House lies within the curtilage of a listed building, namely Swakeleys House.",
    "The applicant has failed to secure parking permit restrictions for future occupiers and financial contributions required to mitigate the highways impacts created by the proposed development. The scheme therefore conflicts with Policies DMCI 7, DMT 1 and DMT 2 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (January 2020), the adopted Planning Obligations Supplementary Planning Document (July 2014), Policy DF1 of the London Plan (2021) and paragraphs 54-57 of the National Planning Policy Framework (February 2019). Prior approval is refused under Condition AA.2.-(1)(a).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service. We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal.",
    "This is a reminder that Under the terms of the Planning Act 2008 (as amended) and Community Infrastructure Levy Regulations 2010 (as amended), should an application for appeal be allowed, the proposed development would be deemed as 'chargeable development' and therefore liable to pay the London Borough of Hillingdon Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and the Mayor of London's Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This would be calculated in accordance with the London Borough of Hillingdon CIL Charging Schedule 2014 and the Mayor of London's CIL Charging Schedule 2012.",
