    "The application fails to provide evidence of a site search demonstrating that this is the only suitable site and has not therefore passed the sequential test and also fails to demonstrate that the site is safe and flood risk is suitably mitigated through the provision of an appropriate flood risk assessment, in accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework and National Planning Practice Guidance. The proposal is thus contrary to Policy EM6 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policy DMEI 9 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), Policy 5.12 of the London Plan (2016) and the NPPF.",
    "The proposed two storey side extension, by reason of its siting in this open prominent position, size, scale, bulk, width and design, would fail to appear as a subordinate addition and would thus fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original building, would be detrimental to the character, appearance and symmetry of the pair of semi-detached building of which it forms a part and to the visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "The proposal has not demonstrated that sufficient off street parking would be provided, and therefore the development is considered to result in substandard car parking provision, leading to on-street parking/queuing to the detriment of public and highway safety and contrary to Policies DMT 2, DMT 6 and Appendix C of the of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "The proposal, by reason of its proposed extension and arrangement of parking and bin storage in the front 'garden' is unacceptable. There is insufficient space to provide at least 25% soft landscape and the clutter of bin stores and parking/manoeuvring space will be detrimental to the visual amenity of the street scene and the wider area. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2016). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020.",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan - The Spatial Development Strategy for London consolidated with alterations since 2011 (2016) and national guidance."
