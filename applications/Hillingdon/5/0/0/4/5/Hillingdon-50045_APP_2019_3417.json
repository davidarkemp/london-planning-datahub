    "The development hereby permitted shall be begun before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.",
    "REASON",
    "To comply with Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990.",
    "The development hereby permitted shall not be carried out except in complete accordance with the details shown on the submitted plans, numbers, 1292-GTA-ZZ-00-PS-A-XX-0006 Rev. 1.0, 1292-GTA-ZZ-00-GP-A-0013 Rev.2.0, 1292-GTA-ZZ-00-GP-A-23-0013 Rev. 1.0, 1292-GTA-ZZ-00-GP-A-27-0016 Rev. 1.0, 1292-GTA-ZZ-00-AE-A-21-0020 Rev. 1.0, 1292-GTA-ZZ-00-AE-A-21-0021 Rev. 1.0, 1292-GTA-ZZ-00-AE-A-21-0024 Rev. 1.0, 1292-GTA-ZZ-00-AE-A-21-0026 Rev. 1.0 and 1292-GTA-ZZ-00-PS-A-XX-0005 Rev. 1.0 and shall thereafter be retained/maintained for as long as the development remains in existence.",
    "REASON",
    "To ensure the development complies with the provisions Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two Saved UDP Policies (November 2012) and the London Plan (2016).",
    "The development hereby permitted shall not be occupied until the following has been completed in accordance with the specified supporting plans and/or documents:",
    "Transport Statement",
    "Design and Access Statement",
    "Thereafter the development shall be retained/maintained in accordance with these details for as long as the development remains in existence",
    "REASON",
    "To ensure the development complies with the provisions Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two Saved UDP Policies (November 2012) and the London Plan (2016).",
    "The decision to GRANT planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to GRANT planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Unitary Development Plan Saved Policies (September 2007) as incorporated into the Hillingdon Local Plan (2012) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including the London Plan (July 2011) and national guidance.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the 'Saved' UDP 2007,  Local Plan Part 1, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably.",
    "Given the nature of the proposed development it is possible that a crane may be required during its construction.  The applicant's attention is drawn to the requirement within the British Standard Code of Practice for the safe use of Cranes, for crane operators to consult the aerodrome before erecting a crane in close proximity to an aerodrome.  This is explained further in Advice Note 4, 'Cranes and Other Construction Issues' (available at www.aoa.org.uk/publications/safeguarding.asp)",
    "The development is close to the aerodrome and the approach to the runway. We draw attention to the need to carefully design lighting proposals. This is further explained in Advice Note 2, 'Lighting near Aerodromes' available at http://www.aoa.org.uk/policy-campaigns/operations-safety/. Please note that the Air Navigation Order 2005, Article 135 grants the Civil Aviation Authority power to serve notice to extinguish or screen lighting which may endanger aircraft."
