    "The proposed development, by reason of the siting of the off street parking bays, pedestrian access for the proposed flats and cycle storage and bin stores, would result in an excessive area of hardstanding/parking on this frontage, and would not allow sufficient space to mitigate this impact by way of soft landscaping and would result in a cluttered appearance. The proposal would therefore be detrimental to the visual amenities of the street scene and character and appearance of the wider Barnhill Estate Area of Special Local Character. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies BE1 and HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 1, DMHB 5, DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHB 14 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), Policies HC1, D4 and D8 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate a satisfactory policy led approach to the car and cycle parking provision and layout for the proposed dwellings which could be prejudicial to all road users safety, contrary to policy DMT6 of the Hillingdon Local Plan - Part Two (2020) and Policies T5 and T6 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan - The Spatial Development Strategy for London consolidated with alterations since 2011 (2016) and national guidance.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service."
