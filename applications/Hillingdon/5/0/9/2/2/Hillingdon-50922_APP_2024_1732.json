    "The single storey rear extension, by reason of excessive depth, scale, and siting would result in unacceptable harm to the adjoining semi-detached house in terms of loss of daylight/sunlight and visual outlook. As such, the proposed extension would fail to respect the residential amenity of neighbouring residents and would therefore conflict with National Planning Policy Framework (2023), Policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021), Policies BE1 and BE15 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One Strategic Policies (2012) and Policies DMHB 1, and DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The proposed single storey rear extension by reason of design, scale and massing would have a harmful impact on the character and appearance of the host dwelling insofar that it would constitute an incongruous addition to the detriment of the visual amenity and character of the semi-detached formation and the surrounding residential area. In addition, the development would represent a significant loss of garden land use and would therefore fail to respect the character and appearance of the surrounding area. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy D4 of the London Plan (2021),  Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan (Part 1) (2012), Policies DMHD 1 and DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan (Part 2) (2020) and the National Planning Policy Framework 2023.",

    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan - The Spatial Development Strategy for London consolidated with alterations since 2011 (2016) and national guidance."
