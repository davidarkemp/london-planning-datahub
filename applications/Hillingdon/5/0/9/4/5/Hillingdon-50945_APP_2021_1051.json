    "The proposed single storey rear extension, by reason of its depth, size, design and proximity, would result in an overly dominant feature that would overshadow the adjoining property at No. 5 Garth Close, and as such would be a visually intrusive and un-neighbourly form of development, resulting in a loss of light and material loss of residential amenity contrary to Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan:Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service."
