P01), 4908-0303 (Rev. P08), 4908-0400 (Rev. P05) and 4908-0401 (Rev. P07) together with the Flood Risk Assessment (Ref. 681375-R1-0) dated 9th May 2024 and Cover Letter (Ref. JM/KN0028/20) dated 10th May 2024 and shall thereafter be retained and maintained for as long as the development remains in existence.",
    "REASON",
    "To ensure the development complies with the provisions Hillingdon Local Plan Parts 1 (November 2012) and 2 (January 2020) and the London Plan (2021).",
    "The materials to be used in the construction of the external surfaces of the development hereby permitted shall match those used in the existing building.",

    "The Equality Act 2010 seeks to protect people accessing goods, facilities and services from discrimination on the basis of a 'protected characteristic', which includes those with a disability. As part of the Act, service providers are obliged to improve access to and within the structure of their building, particularly in situations where reasonable adjustment can be incorporated with relative ease. The Act states that service providers should think ahead to take steps to address barriers that impede disabled people."
