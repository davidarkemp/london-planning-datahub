    "The proposed rear structure, by reason of its siting, height, width, depth and design would result in an incongruous, bulky, excessive, visually intrusive and oppressive form of the development that would substantially dominate and clutter the host site. The proposal would fail to be a proportionate addition to the main dwelling, would negatively impact the character and appearance of Coronation Road and visual amenities of the wider area. Therefore, the proposal would fail to comply with Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021), Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012) and  Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12, DMHD 1 and DMHD 2 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The proposed rear structure, by reason of its siting, combined height, width and depth including design would result in substantial harm to the occupiers of no.19 and 23 in terms of loss of outlook, sense of enclosure, overbearing impact, visual impact and loss of daylight/sunlight. Therefore, the proposal would fail to comply with Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021), Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012) and Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12, DMHD 1 and DMHD 2 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The proposed rear structure, by reason of the siting, combined height, width and depth including design would give rise to poor quality living accommodation for existing occupiers of the dwelling in terms of sense of enclosure, overbearing impact, visual impact, loss of daylight/sunlight and outlook alongside complete removal of private amenity space.  Therefore, the proposal would fail to comply with Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021), Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012) and Policies DM HD1, DM HD2, DM HB 11, DMHB 16 and DMHB 18 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2021). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020."
