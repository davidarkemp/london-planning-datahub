    "The Oak is situated within the back garden of 131 Park Avenue. This tree presents a mature and attractive crown. This Oak provides a gradual transition of mature tree cover between the dwellings in Park Avenue and Ruislip Woods Natural Nature Reserve (NNR). The tree has a high amenity value, therefore making a significant positive contribution to the local landscape.",
    "The crown of this Oak appears healthy and in good condition. The work proposed would considerably lessen the height and spread of the appeal tree and consistently reduce its contribution to the character and appearance of the area.",
    "No arboricultural reason has been provided concerning the need to remove 2/3m from the crown and lift crown to 5m. The proposed work would unnecessarily introduce large multiple wounds into the crown, which would likely cause stress and lead to infection, significantly damaging its amenity value and increasing the risk of dieback.",
