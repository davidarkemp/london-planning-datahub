    "The proposed part two storey, part single storey side extension, by virtue of its excessive scale and bulk and lack of set back from the front elevation, would fail to appear as a subordinate addition and would detract from the architectural integrity of the host dwelling. The proposal would fail to comply with the requirements of Policies DMHB11, DMHB12 and DMHD1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan - Part Two (2020) and Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "In the absence of a Tree Survey and Arboricultural Implication Assessment to BS5837:2012 standards, the application has failed to demonstrate that the development will safeguard existing trees on the site and further fails to demonstrate protection for and long-term retention of the trees. The proposal is therefore contrary to the requirements of Policy DMHB 14 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and Policy G7 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "In the absence of a FRA the application fails to demonstrate that the site is safe and flood risk is suitably mitigated through the provision of an appropriate flood risk assessment as required by Policy EM6 Flood Risk Management in Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1- Strategic Policies (Nov 2012)., Policy DMEI 9 Management of Flood Risk in Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 - Development Management Policies, Policy SI12 of the London Plan (2021) and Section 14 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2020)",
    "The proposed side extension, by virtue of its scale, bulk and proximity, would result in an unacceptable loss of light to the first floor side facing bedroom at adjacent Number 129 Park Avenue. The proposal would therefore result in an unacceptable loss of amenity to this habitable room in conflict with Policies DMHB11 and DMHD1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan - Part Two (2020).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
