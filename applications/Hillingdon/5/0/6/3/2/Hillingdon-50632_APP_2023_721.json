    "The proposed part single storey, part two storey side extension and new roof form (including an increase to the main ridge height of the",
    "host dwelling) and changes to existing dormers, by reason of their cumulative size, scale, bulk, height and design (including the uncharacteristic glazing), would result in a disproportionate and incongruous form of development that would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original dwelling and the associated property at No. 20 Frithwood Avenue. The proposal would be detrimental to the appearance of the original host dwelling, and cause harm to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the existing street scene and result in a harmful visual impact on the character and appearance of the Northwood, Frithwood Conservation Area and wider area. It would fail to either preserve or enhance the character of the conservation area, and there are no public benefits that would outweigh the identified less than substantial harm. T",
    "The proposed part single storey, part two storey side extension and new roof form (including an increase to the main ridge height of the",
    "host dwelling) and changes to existing dormers , by reason of its proximity, depth, scale, bulk and height, would have a harmful impact on the living conditions of the occupiers at numbers 20 Frithwood Avenue and their associated private amenity space, in terms of loss of light,",
    "outlook, overdominance, sense of enclosure and overbearing impact. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012) and Policies DMHD 1 and DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The proposed development would result in a shortfall to the already limited private amenity space provision for the existing dwelling, and would therefore give rise to a substandard form of living accommodation to the detriment of the amenity of future occupiers. The proposal, therefore, conflicts with Policy DMHB 18 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021) and Section 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.  We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
