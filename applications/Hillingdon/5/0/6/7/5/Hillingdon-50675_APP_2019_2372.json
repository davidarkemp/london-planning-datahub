    "The proposed outbuilding by virtue of its size, scale, layout and the existence of an independent access, would be tantamount to the creation of a self contained separate dwelling, where such a dwelling would not be acceptable due to its impact on the character and appearance of the host dwelling and the wider locality, the need for additional parking and amenity space and issues relating to impact on the existing and adjoining dwellings. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policies AM14, BE13, BE15, BE19, BE20, BE21, BE23 and BE24 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Saved UDP Policies (November 2012), Policy DMHD 2 of the emerging Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies with Modifications (March 2019) and the Council's adopted Supplementary Planning Document HDAS: Residential Extensions.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. The Council's supports pre-application discussions.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reason for refusal."
