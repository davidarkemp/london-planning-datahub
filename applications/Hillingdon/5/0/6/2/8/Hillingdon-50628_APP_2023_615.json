    "The proposed development, by virtue of the intensification of use of the property and its close proximity to neighbours, would have a significant adverse impact on the amenities of neighbours from increased noise and activity. As such, the proposal is contrary to Section 15 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021, Policy D14 of the London Plan 2021, Policies BE1 and EM8 of the Hillingdon Local Plan (Part 1) 2012 and Policies DHHB 8 and DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan (Part 2) 2020.",
    "There is an absence of justification or need for a residential care facility for parents with babies in the borough and the Council is not supportive of such facilities. When weighed against the loss of a single dwelling in use class C3, the principle of the development is contrary to Policies DMH 1 and DMH 8 of the Hillingdon Local Plan (Part 2) 2020.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service. We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
