    "The detached building, by reason of its size, scale, bulk, height and excessive footprint, results in an over dominant and visually obtrusive form of development, to the detriment of the visual amenity of the surrounding residential properties and the character and appearance of the wider area including the adjoining Hillingdon Village Conservation Area contrary to policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and policies DMHB 4, DMHD 2 and DMHB 11 of The Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The development, by reason of its scale, form, design and appearance would result in an adverse impact on the setting of the listed Building, Conservation Area and the curtilage listed garden wall, and would fail to adequately preserve or enhance the heritage asset in accordance to the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990, contrary to Policy BE1 and HE1 of the The Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies (2012) and Policy DMHB 1 of The Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The proposed outbuilding by virtue of its size, scale, layout and the existence of an independent access, would be tantamount to the creation of a self contained separate dwelling, where such a dwelling would not be acceptable due to its impact on the character and appearance of the host dwelling and the wider locality, the need for additional parking and amenity space and issues relating to impact on the existing and adjoining dwellings. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policies DMT 6, DMHB 4, DMHD 2 and Policy DMHB 11 of The Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020) and Policies BE1 and HE1 of the The Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies (2012).",
    "In the absence of a tree survey, or report to BS5837:2012, the applicant has failed to demonstrate that protected trees will be unaffected by the development and has not made provision for their protection. Therefore, the proposal would be contrary to Policies DMHD 2 and DMHB 14 of The Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan - The Spatial Development Strategy for London consolidated with alterations since 2011 (2016) and national guidance.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
