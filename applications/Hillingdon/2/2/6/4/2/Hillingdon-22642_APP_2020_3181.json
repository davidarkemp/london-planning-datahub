  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed development, by reason of the glazing at roof level and its width, proximity to neighbouring boundaries and forward position, would result in a poor, incongruous and overly dominant form of development that would be detrimental to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the site, the street scene and the wider area.  The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), Policy D4 of the London Plan (2021) and the NPPF (2019).",
    "The proposal would result in the provision of windows to habitable rooms that would be obscure glazed and there would be no outlook from these bedroom windows resulting in harm to the amenity of future occupants. The development would therefore be contrary to Policy DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021) and the NPPF (2019).",
    "The proposed development, by virtue of it's poor external layout would fail to provide an adequate level of external amenity for future residents in accordance with the Council's standards to the detriment of the amenity of future occupants. The development is therefore contrary to Policies DMHB 11 and DMHB 18 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021) and the NPPF (2019).",
    "The proposal would result in the provision of several habitable rooms facing towards the side elevations of both of the neighbouring properties resulting in loss of or perceived loss of privacy to the occupants of those dwellings harmful to their residential amenity. The development would therefore be contrary to Policy DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The lack of an internal lift to provide adequate access to all users of the development would constitute a substandard form of development, harming the residential amenity of future occupants. The development would therefore be contrary to DMHB 11 and DMHB 16 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and Policy D5 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "The proposed development fails to provide sufficient off-street parking, and therefore the development is considered to result in substandard car parking provision, potentially leading to undue on-street parking to the detriment of public and highway safety contrary to Policies DMT 1, DMT 2 & DMT 6 of the Local Plan: Part 2 Development Plan (2020) and Policies T6 and T6.1 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan - The Spatial Development Strategy for London consolidated with alterations since 2011 (2016) and national guidance."
