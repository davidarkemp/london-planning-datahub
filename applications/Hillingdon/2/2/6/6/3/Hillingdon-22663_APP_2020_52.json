  "decision_conditions": [
    "The roof alteration and extensions, by reason of the provision of a crown roof, an increase in ridge height and the size, scale, bulk and design of the rear dormer roof extension would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original detached bungalow, would be detrimental to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policy DMHD 1, DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the 'Saved' UDP 2007, Local Plan Part 1, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.  No pre-application advice was sought but case officer had a meeting with applications as a duty officer.   As such, the applicant would have been aware of the previous reasons for refusal."
