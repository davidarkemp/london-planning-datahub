  "description": "To remove One Oak T5 on TPO 295",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The Oak tree is situated within the front garden of 59 Park Avenue and it is highly visible. Park avenue is used by many as a through road and as a result a very high number of residents and visitors will regularly benefit from its presence. This Oak has a high amenity value and it significantly contributes to local biodiversity and the local area. It helps to provide a gradual transition of mature tree cover between the dwellings in the Park avenue and the nearby Ruislip woods National Nature Reserve (NNR). The benefit in amenity and biodiversity afforded by the tree is both present and future because it has the potential for a long-life expectancy.",
    "The Oak tree is of a similar age or older than the property, as a result it is expected that roots will be present under the property. The property was partly under pinned in 1991 without the need to remove this valuable tree. Within the applicant's reasons for work they mention \"A root barrier has been considered as an alternative to tree",
    "The removal of deadwood, dangerous / hanging branches and ivy:  This does not require the formal consent of the Council."
