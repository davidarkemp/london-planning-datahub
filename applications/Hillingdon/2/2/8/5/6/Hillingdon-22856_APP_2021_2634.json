    "The proposed part single storey, part two storey side and rear extension, by reason of its bulk, width and design would fail to form a subordiante addition to the host dwelling which harmonises with its original size and architectural composition. The proposed extension would therefore be detrimental to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the dwelling and street that the dwelling is part of. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), as well as policies D3 and D6 of the London Plan and  paragraphs 130 (a) and (c) of the NPPF (2021).",
    "By reason of its oversized extension, uncharacteristically small gardens and failure to provide a adequately spaced parking layout, the proposed development is considered to result in an overdevelopment of the site, which would be out of character with the spaciousness of neighbouring sites and visually cramped to the detriment of the areas character and appearance.  The proposed development is therefore considered to be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), as well as policies D3 and D6 of the London Plan and paragraphs 130 (a) and (c) of the NPPF (2021).",
    "Due to its unsatisfactory car parking layout, the proposed development is likely to result in access issues for occupiers of the new and existing dwelling. Furthermore due to its cramped layout it could result in road side parking which could hinder vehicle movements in the area leading to traffic build up to the detriment of the highways network. Additionally Insufficient information has been submitted to evidence that adequate pedestrian visibility splays would be constructed as part of the new access. The absence of the splays would create a dangerous and hazardous environment for pedestrians using the footpath outside of the site and the sites vehicle users. The proposed development is therefore considered to be detrimental to pedestrian and highway safety, as well as the free movement of vehicles on the local highways network. Insufficient electrical vehicle charging points are also proposed. The proposed development is therefore considered to be contrary to Policies DMT 2 and DMT",
