    "The proposed first floor rear extension, by reason of its overall size, height, bulk, design and proximity to the boundary, in combination with the existing extensions and site context, would be detrimental to the residential amenities of the adjoining occupier at No.16 Breakspear Road by reason of loss of privacy, overlooking, over dominant and overbearing effect. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policies DMHB11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan - Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The proposal would provide 1 additional double bedroom which is below 11.5 sqm and therefore undersized. As such the proposal would give rise to a substandard form of living accommodation to the detriment of the amenity of future occupiers. The proposal would be contrary to Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021) and Policy DMHB 16 of the Hillingdon Local Plan - Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020)."
