    "The development hereby permitted shall not be carried out except in complete accordance with the details shown on the plans numbered 110TR/RP01 and 110TR/SP/01.",
    "REASON",
    "To ensure the development complies with the provisions of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020), and the London Plan (2016).",
    "The materials to be used in the construction of the external surfaces of the development hereby permitted shall match those used in the existing building on site and shall thereafter be retained as such.",
    "REASON",
    "To safeguard the visual amenities of the area and to ensure that the proposed development does not have an adverse effect upon the appearance of the existing building in accordance with Policy DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 (2020)",
    "The outbuilding hereby approved shall only be used as a garage as shown on the approved drawings and shall not be used for purposes such as a living room, bedroom, kitchen, study, as a separate unit of accommodation or for any business purposes. No alterations to the windows, doors or other openings of the outbuilding shall be made.",
    "REASON",
    "To avoid any future fragmentation of the curtilage or the creation of a separate residential or business use, so as to protect the amenity of adjoining residential properties in accordance with Policies DMH 4, DMHB 11, DMHB 16, DMHB 18 and DMT 6 Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "The window on the eastern elevation shall be glazed with permanently obscured glass to at least scale 4 on the Pilkington scale and be non-opening below a height of 1.8 metres taken from internal finished floor level for so long as the development remains in existence.",
    "REASON",
    "To prevent overlooking to adjoining properties in accordance with policy DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 (2020).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2016). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020.",
    "The vehicle crossings should conform to the council's DVFC 2019 Policy i.e. with a maximum width of 3.6m at the back of footway and 4.8m at the edge of kerb for the Torcross frontage and 2.4m at the back of footway and 3.6m at the edge of kerb on Exmouth Road.",
    "The new crossings would need to be constructed to the appropriate council standard executed under S184 of the Highways Act 1980 (or suitable alternative arrangement) at the applicant's/developer's expense. The latter would also apply to the cost of removal and relocation of the street light column fronting the Exmouth Road access."
