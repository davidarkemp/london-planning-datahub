    "The proposed dwelling by reason of its cramped siting and design, would fail to harmonise with the local context, and would be incongruous, visually dominant and detrimental to the visual amenities of the street scene and the character and appearance of the area contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One Strategic Policies (2012), Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMH 6 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021) and Chapter 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The proposed development, by virtue of its size and positioning, would provide an unacceptable residential environment and would cause significant harm to the residential amenities of the neighbouring occupiers at No. 110a Torcross Road and its private amenity space, in terms of loss of privacy and overbearing impact, contrary to Policy DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020) and paragraph 130 (f) of the NPPF (2021).",
    "The proposed rear amenity space, on account of its proximity to the boundary of Nos. 110 and 110a Torcross Road, would be heavily overlooked and lack privacy, providing a poor standard of accommodation for future occupiers of the proposed dwelling contrary to Policies DMHB 16 and DMHB 18 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020) and paragraph 130(f) of the NPPF (2021).",
    "The proposed development, in the absence of an Arboricultural Report to the British Standard 5837:2021, would cause harm to the open and verdant character and appearance of the site and would introduce an urbanising form of development that would not integrate well with its surroundings via the potential loss of a street tree and loss of grass verge. The proposal would therefore conflict with Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012), Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHB 14 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2- Development Management Policies (2020), Policies D3, D4 and G7 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The proposed carriageway crossing serving the on-plot car park space does not align with the council's 'Domestic Vehicle Footway Crossover' (DVFC) 2022 Policy guidance that restricts the extent of grass verge loss which, in this case, is exceeded with the designs presented. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policy DMT 1, DMT 2 and DMT 6 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020), Policies T4, T6 and T6.1 of the London Plan (2021) and paragraph 111 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",

    "This is a reminder that Under the terms of the Planning Act 2008 (as amended) and Community Infrastructure Levy Regulations 2010 (as amended), should an application for appeal be allowed, the proposed development would be deemed as 'chargeable development' and therefore liable to pay the London Borough of Hillingdon Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and the Mayor of London's Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL).
