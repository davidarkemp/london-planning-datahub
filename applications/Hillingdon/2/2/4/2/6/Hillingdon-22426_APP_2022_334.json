  "decision_conditions": [
    "The development proposal, by reason of its size, scale, height, depth, roof form and design, would result in a bulky, insubordinate, incongruous, dominant, and cramped form of development in this visually prominent location that would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original dwelling, and in this open prominent position, would result in the closing of an important gap characteristic to the area, to the detriment of the character, appearance and visual amenities of the street scene and surrounding area. For these reasons, the development proposal would conflict with Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One Strategic Policies (2012) and Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
