    "The proposed side extension, by reason of its siting, bulk, design and appearance would fail to successfully integrate and harmonise with the architectural composition of the existing dwelling. Cumulatively when combined with the gable ended conversion of the main roof, it would erode the openness of the site and lead to an incongruous form of development that visually imbalances the consistency in roof profiles within the street. The development would be detrimental to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area and would therefore be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",

    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan - The Spatial Development Strategy for London consolidated with alterations since 2011 (2016) and national guidance."
