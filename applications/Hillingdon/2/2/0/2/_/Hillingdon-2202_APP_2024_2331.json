    "Due to its height, width, depth, design and position alongside other extensions, the proposed development is considered to form an oversized, insubordinate and harmful addition to the character and appearance of the host dwelling. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies, Policies DMHD 1, DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policies D1 and D3 of the London Plan (2021), as well as paragraph 135 of the NPPF (2023).",
    "The existing dwelling is part of a group of historic buildings located within the Cowley Church (St. Laurence) Conservation Area. Due to its height, width, depth, design and position alongside other extensions, the proposed development would form an oversized addition to the host dwelling. The resulting dwelling would lose its historic subordinate nature to other buildings within the group, thereby harming the collective group of buildings and subsequently the Conservation Area. The less than substantial harm caused to the Conservation Area would not be outweighed by any public benefits. The development is therefore contrary to  Policy HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies, Policies DMHB 1 and DMHB 4 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policies HC1 of the London Plan (2021), as well as paragraph 208 of the NPPF (2023).",

    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan (2021) and NPPF (2023)."
