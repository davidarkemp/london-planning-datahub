    "The proposed part two storey side/rear extensions, by reason of their size, scale, bulk and proximity to the side boundaries, would result in a closing of the visually open gap between it and the neighbouring properties, 59 and 63 Thornhill Road, giving rise to a cramped form of development, which would be detrimental to the visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area generally. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies.",
    "The proposed two storey side extensions, by virtue of its siting, size, scale and design, including the lack of a set back from the front at all levels, would fail to appear as a subordinate additions and would thus be detrimental to the architectural composition of the original dwelling, the visual amenities of the street scene and the character and appearance of the wider area. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "The proposed front porch and front extension (store), by reason of their size, scale, bulk and design would result in incongruous and overly dominant additions which would be detrimental to the architectural composition of the original dwelling, the visual amenities of the street scene and the character and appearance of the wider area. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "The application fails to demonstrate that the site is safe and flood risk is suitably mitigated through the provision of an appropriate flood risk assessment. The proposal is thus contrary to Policy EM6 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policy DMEI 9 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy 5.12 of the London Plan (2016) and the National Planning Policy Framework and Planning Practice Guidance.",
