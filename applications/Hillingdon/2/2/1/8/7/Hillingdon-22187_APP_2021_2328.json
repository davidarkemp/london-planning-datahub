    "The proposed first floor side/rear extension by reason of its size, scale, bulk, design and awkward juxtaposition with the roof extension, would fail to appear as a subordinate addition and would thus fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the existing dwelling and would be detrimental to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020) and policies D4 and D8 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "The proposed first floor side extension by reason of its size, scale, bulk and design would exacerbate the hip to gable conversion which has already impacted on the character, appearance and symmetry of the pair of semi-detached houses of which it forms a part and the visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area. The proposed development is therefore contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and policies D4 and D8 of the London Plan (2021).",

We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service."
