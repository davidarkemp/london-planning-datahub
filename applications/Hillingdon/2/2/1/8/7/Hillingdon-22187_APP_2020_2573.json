  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed first floor rear extension by reason of its size, scale, bulk, design and awkward juxtaposition with the roof extension, would fail to appear as a subordinate addition and would thus fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original dwelling, would be detrimental to the character and appearance of the existing property and to the visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "The proposed first floor side extension by reason of its size, scale, bulk and design would exacerbate the hip to gable conversion which has already impacted on the character, appearance and symmetry of the pair of semi-detached houses of which it forms a part and the visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area. The proposed development is therefore contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020)."
