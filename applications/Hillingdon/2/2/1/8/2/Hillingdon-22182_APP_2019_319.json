    "The proposal by reason of vehicles reversing on to Victoria Road, the increase in the number of potential conflict points along the road and its location adjacent to a bus stop would result in the disruption of the free flow of traffic and obscured visibility to the detriment of highway and pedestrian safety contrary to Policies AM7 and AM14 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Saved UDP Policies (November 2012) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document HDAS: Residential Extensions.",
    "The proposal by reason of the loss of the boundary treatment to the frontage and the grass verge, which is a common and attractive feature on this part of Victoria Road, would be detrimental to the visual amenity and character of the area in which it would be set by creating an open parking area and emphasising the appearance of a hard surfaced area. The proposals is thus, contrary to Policies BE13, BE19 and BE38 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two -Saved UDP Policies (November 2012) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document HDAS: Residential Extensions.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. The Council's supports pre-application discussions. As such, the Council has however been unable to achieve a solution to problems arising from the application which would overcome the reasons for refusal."
