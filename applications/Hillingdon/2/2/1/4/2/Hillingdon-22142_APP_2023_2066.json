    "The proposed external finishes and in particular the loss of the Mock Tudor detailing would fail to respect the character and appearance of the host dwelling, adjoining neighbour and fail to respect the prevailing architectural detailing on the properties on this section of the street, resulting in a finish which would be out of character and incongruous on this prominent site. The proposal would result in an unacceptable loss of symmetry with the adjoining property. The proposal therefore fails to comply with Policies BE1 and HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
