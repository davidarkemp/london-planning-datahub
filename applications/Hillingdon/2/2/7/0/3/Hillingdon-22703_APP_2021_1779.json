    "The application site forms part of a Critical Drainage Area. Accordingly, the Council's Flood and Water Management Team advise that the development should minimise the water from the application site entering the sewers. Water run off from any roof or hard paving associated with the development should be directed to a soakaway, tank or be made permeable. It is also recommended that a water butt is incorporated. No drainage to support the extension should be connected to any existing surface water network, other than as an overflow."
