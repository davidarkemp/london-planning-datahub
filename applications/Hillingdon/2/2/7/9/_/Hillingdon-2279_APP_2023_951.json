    "In the absence of a noise assessment or demonstration of any noise mitigation, or any indication of how fumes and odours would be controlled, the use of the proposed outbuilding for car maintenance/repair is likely to give rise to an unacceptable level of noise, disturbance and amenity impacts from odour to the detriment of adjoining residential occupiers. As such the development is contrary to Policy DMHB 11 of the adopted Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and the NPPF.",
    "The proposed outbuilding, by virtue of its size, scale, bulk, height and proximity, would be detrimental to the amenities of residents at 31-37 Magnolia Court, by reason of overdominance, visual intrusion and loss of outlook. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policy DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies.",
    "The applicant has not produced evidence to indicate that the dealership can accommodate this type of proposed business use within the rear car park without undue impact on its operation. In the absence of this it has not been demonstrated that the development would not produce a shortfall of car parking and be detrimental to highway safety. As such the development is contrary to Policy DMT 2 and DMT 6 of the adopted Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The proposed outbuilding, by reason of its excessive size, scale, bulk and height would result in an over dominant and visually obtrusive form of development that fails to respect the prevailing pattern of development within the area and would appear out of scale in its rearward location. As a result, the proposal would be detrimental to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the surrounding area. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012), Policies DMHD 2, DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan - The Spatial Development Strategy for London consolidated with alterations since 2011 (2016) and national guidance.",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2016). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020."
