    "The proposed development, by virtue of its design (including the misaligned fenestration treatment), together with its excessive depth, size, scale, bulk and massing, would cause significant harm to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the area and would fail to either preserve or enhance the significance of the  Eastcote, Morford Way Conservation Area.  The proposal therefore conflicts with Policies BE1 and HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One- Strategic Policies (2012), Policies DMHB 1, DMHB 4, DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy HC1, D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021) and Sections 12 and 16 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The proposed development would not provide any three or more bedroom (family sized) units. Robust justification has not been provided to demonstrate that the provision of family sized units would be unsuitable or unviable. The proposal would therefore not provide a suitable mix of housing to support sustainable, inclusive and mixed communities, contrary to Policy DMH 2 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020) and Policy H10 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "The proposed development, by virtue of the entrance point location for the proposed flats, would provide a substandard living environment for future occupiers, in terms of poor access, safety and security. The proposal therefore conflicts with Policies DMHB 15 and DMHB 16 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020), Policies D6 and D11 of the London Plan (2021) and Section 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The proposed development, by reason of the absence of any private external amenity space provision, would result in a substandard form of residential accommodation to the detriment of future occupants. The proposal therefore conflicts with Policy DMHB 18 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021) and Section 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The proposed development, by virtue of the absence of any lift provision and the lack of details to show that the internal layout would comply with Building Regulation requirement M4(2) and M4(3), fails to demonstrate that adequate provision would be provided to meet the needs of people with disabilities. The proposed development therefore conflicts with Policies D5 and D7 of the London Plan (2021) and Section 8 and 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The proposed development fails to provide an adequate number of long and short stay cycle spaces to meet the London Plan (2021)'s minimum standards found in Table 10.2. The cycle store, sited within an area shared with the bin store, would not be well-located as it would give rise to practicality, odour and smell issues for future occupiers accessing their cycles. The proposal would therefore fail to facilitate and encourage cycling as a sustainable mode of transport contrary to Policy DMT 5 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020) and Policy T5 of the London Plan (2021) and Section 9 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The proposed development fails to demonstrate that accessible and convenient refuse and recycling facilities, without being a nuisance to future occupiers in respect to odour and smells and without compromising the accessibility of the cycle spaces. The proposal would therefore conflict with Policy DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020) and Section 12 and 14 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service. We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
