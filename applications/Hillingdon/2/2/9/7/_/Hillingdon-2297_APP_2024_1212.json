    "Given the ambiguities within the plan provided and the lack of any additional or supporting information relating to the materials, loss of soft landscaping or appearance of the bin stores and fences, it is considered that insufficient information has been provided to establish whether or not these changes are non-material amendments and therefore cannot be considered to comply with Section 96A of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990. The application is therefore recommended for refusal.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably. In addition further guidance was offered to the applicant by the case officer during the processing of the application to identify the amendments to address those elements of the scheme considered unacceptable which the applicant chose not to implement."
