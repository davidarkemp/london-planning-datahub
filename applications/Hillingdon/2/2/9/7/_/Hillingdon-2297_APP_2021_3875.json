    "Prior to the first occupation of the development hereby approved, a Playing Field Monitoring and Maintenance Scheme, developed by a suitably qualified sports agronomist, shall be submitted to, and approved in writing by, the Local Planning Authority, in consultation with Sport England. The Playing Field Monitoring and Maintenance Scheme shall ensure that the eastern playing field is maintained to its current condition, taking into consideration the increased playing field usage due to the temporary loss of the western playing field for a period of 36 months.",
    "Reason: To ensure that there is no impact on playing field quality and to ensure that the playing field can accommodate the anticipated level of sport and physical activity in compliance with Policy CI1 of the Local Plan: Part One (2012) , Policies DMCI1A, DMHB 11 and DMHB 14  of the Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and Policy S5 of the London Plan (2021).",

    "It is recommended that a restoration scheme for playing field land is undertaken by a specialist turf consultant.

As part of the Act, service providers areobliged to improve access to and within the structure oftheir building, particularly in situations where reasonableadjustment can be incorporated with relative ease. TheAct states that service providers should think ahead totake steps to address barriers that impede disabledpeople.",
    "The Council is aware of the presence of land, situated approximately 270 metres from the boundary of the subject site. The materials in the landfill had limited potential to emit gas. However, the current risk of gas migration is considered minimal due to the age of the landfill.  It is recommended that the temporary structure/s are suitably placed to minimise the possible entry of any migrating landfill gas/ground gas.",
    "Considerations in relation to gas pipeline/s identified on site: Cadent have identified operational gas apparatus within the application site boundary. This may include a legal interest (easements or wayleaves) in the land which restricts activity in proximity to Cadent assets in private land. The Applicant must ensure that proposed works do not infringe on Cadent's legal rights and any details of such restrictions should be obtained from the landowner in the first instance.  If buildings or structures are proposed directly above the gas apparatus then development should only take place following a diversion of this apparatus. The Applicant should contact Cadent's Plant Protection Team at the earliest opportunity to discuss proposed diversions of apparatus to avoid any unnecessary delays. If any construction traffic is likely to cross a Cadent pipeline then the Applicant must contact Cadent's Plant Protection Team to see if any protection measures are required. All developers are requi",
