    "The site lies in a Critical Drainage Area (CDA) identified in Hillingdon's Surface Water Management Plan (SWMP). A CDA is the catchment area where surface water drains and contributes to drainage problems. All developments in this area must contribute to managing the risk of flooding from surface water by reducing surface water runoff from the site. Therefore, the Applicant should minimise the water from your site entering the sewers. No drainage to support the extension should be connected to any existing surface water sewer, other than as an overflow. The Applicant should direct water runoff from any roof or hard paving associated with the development to a soakaway or tank or make the paving permeable. This includes any work to front gardens not part of the planning application, which must be permeable or be collected and directed to a permeable area. Otherwise, it would need additional permission. The Applicant should incorporate a water butt.",
