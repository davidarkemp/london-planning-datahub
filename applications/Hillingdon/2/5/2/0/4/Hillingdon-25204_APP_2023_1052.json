    "The proposed extension, by virtue of its siting, depth, size, scale, bulk, proximity to the side boundary and design would fail to appear as a subordinate addition and would thus be detrimental to the appearance of the original house, the terrace of which it forms part and the visual amenities of the street scene and the character and appearance of the wider area. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "The proposed single storey rear extension, by reason of its depth, design and proximity, would result in an overly dominant feature that would result in an overbearing impact on the adjacent property at No. 15 Lynhurst Crescent, and as such would result in a visually intrusive and an un-neighbourly form of development, resulting in a material loss of residential amenity. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan - Part Two (2020).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
