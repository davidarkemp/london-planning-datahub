    "The willow tree in situated within the rear garden of 38 Sweetcroft Lane, it can be viewed from between the properties and when traveling along Sweetcroft lane from Long Lane. As a result it has a moderate to high amenity value and contributes to the arboreal character of the area.",
    "No previous application or 5 day notice can be found to determine when the large lower limbs referred to were removed (this might pre-date our electronic copies). As this does not appear to be a recent event and the tree appears to have adapted to its form removal is seen as unjustified. Willows take well to pruning and the applicant may wish to re-apply to carry out reduction works.",
