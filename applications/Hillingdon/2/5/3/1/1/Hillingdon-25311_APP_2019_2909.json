On the 8th November 2012 Hillingdon's Full Council agreed the adoption of the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies. Appendix 5 of this explains which saved policies from the old Unitary Development (which was subject to a direction from Secretary of State in September 2007 agreeing that the policies were 'saved') still apply for development control decisions.",
    "The development requires the formation of a vehicular crossover, which will be constructed by the Council.  This work is also subject to the issuing of a separate licence to obstruct or open up the public highway.
