    "Due to its depth and siting, the proposed part single storey, part two storey rear extension would be overbearing to the occupiers of the neighbouring property No.23 Findhorn Avenue resulting in an unacceptable loss of light and outlook to the occupants of this neighbouring property. The development is therefore contrary to Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), as well as Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021) and paragraph 135 (f) of the NPPF 2024.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "In order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably. In addition further guidance was offered to the applicant by the case officer during the processing of the application to identify the amendments to address those elements of the scheme considered unacceptable which the applicant chose not to implement."
