  "description": "Part two storey part single storey rear extension and conversion of roofspace to habitable use to include a rear dormer, 2 front rooflights and conversion of roof from hip to gable end.",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed roof alteration to include rear dormer and conversion of the hip to gable end, by reason of its design, scale, bulk and siting, would appear obtrusive within the street scene which will have a detrimental impact on the character and appearance of the area. Consequently, the relationship between the proposed part first floor rear extension and the roof alteration including rear dormer roof extension, is considered to introduce unsympathetic additions to the host dwelling that would have an adverse cumulative impact on the character and appearance of the wider area and this form of development is not characteristic in the local area. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policies BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), Policy 3.5 of the London Plan (2016) and the NPPF."
