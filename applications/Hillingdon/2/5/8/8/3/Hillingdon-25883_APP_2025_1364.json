    "The proposed outbuilding, by virtue of its scale, bulk and siting,  would significantly increase the built up character and appearance of the site, to the detriment of the character and appearance of this prominent corner plot.  The outbuilding would appear prominent from both the Windsor Avenue and Sedgewick Avenue streetscenes and result in a cramped and incongruous form of development. The proposal would therefore contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012), Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD2 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policies D1, D3, D4 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2024).",

We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service."
