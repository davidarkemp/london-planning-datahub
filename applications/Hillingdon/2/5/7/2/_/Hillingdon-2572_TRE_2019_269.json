    "Lombardy Poplar x 4 (T10, T11, T12 & T13 (G1)  Reduce heights by approximately 4-5m - To pre-empt possible future failures",
    "Good/ Mature  Moderate - Reduce heights by approximately 4-5m",
    "Lombardy Poplar x 7 (T2, T4, T5, T6, T7, T8, T9 on plan)  Poor/ Over Mature - Fell/remove - Majority of trees are structaurally unsafe.",
    "The tree(s) to be pruned (T10, T11, T12, T13) shall be crown reduced as per the approved specification / by a maximum of 4-5m in total height. This work shall comprise a reduction in both height and spread over the whole crown by shortening or removing peripheral branches in a uniform and systematic manner.  Where branches are shortened, they should be cut back to a suitably positioned secondary branch.",
    "Crown reduction shall not be construed as 'lopping' or 'topping' and shall result in a tree of typical form for the species and of balanced appearance. The works shall be carried out in accordance with the recommendations contained in BS 3998:2010 'Tree work - Recommendations'. Climbing irons or 'spikes' shall not be used during the execution of the work.",
    "REASON",
    "In order to protect health of the tree and the visual amenity of the area.",
    "Crown reduction and/or crown reshaping:  Involves the overall reduction of the height and spread of a tree's crown, whilst, as far as possible, retaining its natural shape. It is advisable to retain smaller branches close to the pruning wounds to aid in the drawing up of water to the wounded tissue.",
    "Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981:  Note that it is an offence under this act to disturb roosting bats, nesting birds or any other protected species.  Therefore, if applicable, it is advisable to consult your tree surgeon / consultant to agree an acceptable time for carrying out the approved works.",
    "Risk of heave: You are advised that a risk of soil heave and heave-related damage to properties may arise following the felling / removal of trees. Therefore, it is advisable for you to obtain independent expert advice prior to carrying out the approved tree felling. Hillingdon Council cannot and will not accept responsibility or liability for any damages associated with the implementation of this consent.",
    "Stump removal: After felling, tree stumps are frequently colonised by honey fungus (Armillaria sp.) which is known to spread and colonise nearby trees. Some trees and woody plants can often be killed by honey fungus and, therefore, it is advisable to remove the tree stump and roots as soon as possible after felling.",
    "No felling shall take place until such time as a scheme has been submitted to, and approved in writing by, the Local Planning Authority for a replacement tree(s), which shall be of 'Standard' size (about 2-3m high) and short-staked for support. The replacement tree shall be planted during the first planting season following the felling works hereby permitted. Thereafter, the replacement tree(s) shall be retained indefinitely and maintained (watered and weeded during the spring and summer) for 2-3 years, or until established.",
    "REASON",
    "In order to comply with the requirements of Section 206 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990.",
    "Lombardy Poplar x 2 (G1) T1 & T3 on plan  - Fell/remove - Majority of trees are structurally unsafe",
    "Good / Mature / Over Mature",
    "The removal of deadwood, dangerous / hanging branches and ivy:  This does not require the formal consent of the Council.",
    "Refusal of part of the requested works: The applicant retains a right of appeal against the part of the application that has effectively been refused (Lombardy Poplars (T1 & T3) - Fell/remove).",
    "The two Lombardy Poplars (T1 and T3 on the plan) have a moderate amenity value. These two trees are prominent features in the local landscape and make a good contribution to the visual amenity and arboreal character of the local area.",
    "No clear reasons have been provided to justify the removal of these trees. In the tree report which is provided on these trees - they are noted as being in a fair to good condition. Furthermore, it has been noted that \"no inherent faults have been found\". Therefore, the proposed removal of these trees is viewed as unnecessary and unjustified.",
    "Conclusion: Having regard to the works which have been proposed - works to remove these two trees are seen as unjustified and unnecessary and will have a detrimental impact on the visual amenity and arboreal character of the local area."
