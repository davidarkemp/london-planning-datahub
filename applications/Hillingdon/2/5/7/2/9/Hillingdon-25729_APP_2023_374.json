    "The proposed roof alterations, the rear dormer and first floor rear extension to the dwelling, by reason of their size, scale, bulk and design, would cumulatively appear as  insubordinate and visually incongruous additions that would be harmful to the character and appearance of the dwellinghouse and the visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area. The proposal, therefore, conflicts, with Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - 1 Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local plan - Part Two (2020) and Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021) and Chapter 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The proposed rear extension, by virtue of its excessive size, width, bulk, depth, massing and proximity to the neighbouring boundary, would be detrimental to the amenities of the neighbouring occupiers at No.29 Hardy Avenue, by reason of overdominance, overshadowing, visual intrusion, loss of outlook and creating a sense of enclosure. The proposal, therefore, conflicts, with Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHD 1 and DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "The development proposal, due to the use of roof lights and lack of aspect, would not provide an adequate outlook and source of natural light for two bedrooms, resulting in substandard living accommodation for future occupiers. The proposal, therefore, conflicts, with the Housing quality and standards of Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021) and Policy DMHB 16 of Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2021). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020."
