    "The change of use of Vine Lodge, High Street from Offices Use Class E(g)(i) to a Nursery Use Class E(f) is permitted development as set out in the Town and Country Planning (Use Classes) Order 1987 (as amended). On the balance of probabilities, the existing building has been in use as an office use Class E(g)(i) for a period of at least 10 years. The proposed development is therefore lawful.",
    "This application relates solely to establishing the lawful use of the building as a Nursery Use Class E(f). The applicant is reminded that any internal or external works may require the submission of planning permission and listed building consent.",
    "It should be noted that whilst the proposed works are lawful, odour and noise emission associated with the proposed change of use must comply with the restrictions set out in the Environmental Protection Act 1990 (and other relevant legislation),  in order to protect the public and nearby occupiers from unacceptable and harmful levels of noise or odour emission."
