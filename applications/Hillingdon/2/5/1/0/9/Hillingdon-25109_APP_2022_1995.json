    "The proposed development, by virtue of its cumulative size, scale, design, siting and proximity to the side boundary, would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original semi-detached dwelling, would result in a cramped form of development that eliminates and important gap between dwellings and would be detrimental to the character and appearance of the pair of semi-detached houses of which it forms a part and to the visual amenities of the street scene and character of the surrounding area. Therefore the proposal is contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020) Policy D3 of the London plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
