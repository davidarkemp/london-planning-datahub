    "The proposed fascia sign, by virtue of its prominent corner plot position, excessive size, scale, height and non-conformity with the adjoining shop signs within the parade, would cause significant harm to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the host building, the local parade it forms a part of, and the street scene. It is also considered that the proposed fascia sign would fail to preserve or enhance the significance, character and appearance of the adjoining the Eastcote (Morford Way) Conservation Area and the locally listed buildings at Nos. 173-195 Field End Road.  The proposal would therefore conflict with Policies BE1 and HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 1, DMHB 3, DMHB 4, DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHB 13A of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), Policy HC1 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021)."
