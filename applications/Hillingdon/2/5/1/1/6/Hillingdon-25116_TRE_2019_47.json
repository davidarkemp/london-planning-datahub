    "These over mature Oak trees are situated in the rear garden of the property with one tree (T9) in the far northwestern corner of the property. The other two trees (T10 & T11) are located to the south of the property and are both nearer to the house. All three of these trees do not appear to have been pruned (reduced) before and, as a result, they have retained an attractive, natural looking crown, typical of these species. The trees are highly visible and have a moderate amenity value making a good contribution to the visual amenity and arboreal character of the local area.",

These works would unnecessarily introduce multiple wounds into the crown of these trees which would likely lead to infection. Additionally, the proposed work would reduce the size and amenity value of these trees, and would also be detrimental to their natural appearance.",
