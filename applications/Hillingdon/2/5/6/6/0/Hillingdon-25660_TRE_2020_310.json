    "The Ash is part of a woodland which is protected in its entirety. This wooded area is being managed as a natural area with minimal external disturbance and it contributes to a great extent to the arboreal character and amenity of the area. This Ash represents an important feature of the woodland, both for its moderate-to-high amenity value and for its contribution to the local biodiversity.",
    "The tree is located on the opposite side of the road, at a considerable distance from the property and overhangs the property's front garden by less than 1 m. The tree appears healthy and in good condition, and pruning would unnecessarily introduce multiple wounds into its crown which would likely cause stress and lead to infection, affecting its long-term health. Pruning would also result in weakly attached re-growth forming that would be prone to future failure. This would affect the safe useful life expectancy of the tree.",
