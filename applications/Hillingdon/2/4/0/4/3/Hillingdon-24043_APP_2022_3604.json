    "By virtue of the backland location, expanse of additional hardstanding, two storey plus loft height and inconsistency in siting and alignment, the proposed dwellings would result in a development that does not harmonise with the built form and significantly detracts from the landscape character of the area. There is a loss of green space associated with the rear garden, there is inconsistency with the pattern and rhythm of development and there is harm to the setting and openness of the Green Belt to the west, contrary to Paragraph 130 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021 and Policies BE1, DMH 6 and DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan 2020",
    "By virtue of its inconsistent siting and two storey height, the proposed dwelling at Plot A will pose unacceptable neighbour amenity impacts to the occupants of 35A The Drive, including dominance, loss of outlook and sense of enclosure to the rear elevation and rear garden and unacceptable overlooking to the side windows. Further, the siting of the bin store and parking area within Plot A would likely result in undesirable odour and light spill impacts for the occupants of 35A The Drive. This is contrary to Policies BE1, DMHB 1, DMHD 11 and DMH 6 of the Hillingdon Local Plan 2020.",
    "In the absence of sufficient accessibility information, it has not been demonstrated that the proposal would be designed and constructed as accessible and adaptable in accordance with M4(2) as set out in Approved Document M to the Building Regulations (2015 edition). This is contrary to Paragraph 130 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021, Policy D7 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan 2020.",
    "In the absence of sufficient ecology information, it has not been demonstrated that the proposal would not have an adverse impact upon protected species and nature conservation or that there would be protection and enhancement of biodiversity. This is contrary to Section 15 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021, Policies BE1, DMH 6, DMHB 14 and DMEI 7 of the Hillingdon Local Plan 2020 and Policy G6 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "The proposal includes discharge of surface water to the private sewer without adequate justification for alternate methods of sustainable design considerations, contrary to Section 15 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021, Policy DMEI 10 of the Hillingdon Local Plan 2020 and Policy SI13 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan - The Spatial Development Strategy for London consolidated with alterations since 2011 (2016) and national guidance.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service. We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
