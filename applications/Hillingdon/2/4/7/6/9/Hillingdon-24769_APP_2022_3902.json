    "The proposed rear, roof and side extensions, by reason of their cumulative, size, scale, bulk, design and juxtaposition with the existing roof extensions, would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the existing dwelling and its attached neighbour, failing to read as subordinate. The development would also be detrimental to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "The proposed extensions, by reason of their size, scale, bulk and siting, would result in a harmful loss of outlook and light to 13 and 17 Blackpool Gardens, as well as a harmful sense of enclosure and an overbearing impact, detrimental to the amenities of these neighbouring occupiers, contrary to Policies DMHD1 and DMHB11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two (2020)."
