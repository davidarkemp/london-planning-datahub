It is considered that the proposal could result in a detrimental impact to the streetscene and harm the amenities of existing and future residents and for this reason, the submission is  contrary to DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHB 14 of the Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
