    "The proposed outbuilding, by reason of its layout permitting day-to-day private domestic living as well as the availability of independent access to it, would result in the creation of a substandard, self-contained residential unit in a backland position where such a dwelling would be unacceptable as its use would fail to preserve the established character and appearance of the conservation area and fail to provide adequate living conditions for future occupiers. The proposal would therefore conflict with Policies DMH 6, DMHD 2, DMHB 11, DMHB 12, DMHB 16, DMHB 18 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policies D1, D3, D4, D6 and D8 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
