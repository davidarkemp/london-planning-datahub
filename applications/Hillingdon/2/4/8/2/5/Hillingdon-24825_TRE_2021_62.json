    "The Oak tree is situated within the rear garden of 39 Parkfield Road, it can be seen from both Parkfield Road and Rectory Way and is a dominant landscape feature being one of the oldest Oaks in the area. It significantly contributes to the arboreal character of the local area and has a high amenity value. It's benefit in amenity and biodiversity afforded by tree is both present and future because it has the potential for a long-life expectancy.",
    "The applicant states that the tree was last reduced 15 years ago however this is not initially accurate as in 2006 works were approved to complete minor works (To reduce by 4m two overlong limbs facing Rectory Way and to reduce by 3m one overlong limb, and thin by 15% low growth up to a height of 9m) rather than a whole reduction, as a result the upper crown has retained a natural appearance typical of it's species. The tree appears to be in good health with a symmetrical crown, pruning it would unnecessarily introduce multiple wounds into its c",
    "The tree to be pruned shall be crown thinned by the removal of epicormic growth only. Final pruning cuts shall be made at the branch collar and this shall be left intact.",

    "In order to protect health of the tree and the visual amenity of the area.",
    "The tree to be pruned shall be crown lifted as per the approved specification . This work shall involve the tip reduction of low hanging branches and/or the removal of low branches to the height specified and result in a tree of balanced appearance; those branches to be removed shall be removed at their origin and all branch collars shall be left intact.",
    "The works shall be carried out in accordance with the recommendations contained in BS 3998:2010 'Tree work - Recommendations'. Climbing irons or 'spikes' shall not be used during the execution of this work.",
    "REASON",
    "In order to protect health of the tree and the visual amenity of the area.",
    "The removal of deadwood, dangerous / hanging branches and ivy:  This does not require the formal consent of the Council.",

    "Owner(s)'s permission:  Permission should be sought from the owner(s) of the tree(s) and / or the owner(s) of the land that the tree(s) overhang prior to any approved work being carried out.",

If they are not, then enforcement action could being taken which could lead to prosecution and heavy fines. Therefore, it is highly recommended that the works are only carried out by a professional and competent arboriculturist who undertakes to comply with the conditions of this consent and in accordance with industry best practice (BS 3998:2010). The Arboricultural Association can provide details of its approved contractors, who have demonstrated such professionalism and competence, on their website (www.trees.org.uk) or by calling 01242 522152. Or on request the Council can provide a list of contractors who are known to carry out tree work to a good standard and to normally maintain an appropriate policy of indemnity insurance."
