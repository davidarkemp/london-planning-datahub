    "The proposed front and roof extensions by reason of their bulk, form, design, depth, size and siting would be overly large, fail to harmonise with the existing character of the dwelling and fail to read as subservient additions, subsequently failing to preserve or enhance the character and appearance of the streetscene of Hillside Crescent and the Area of Special Local Character, all contrary to the NPPF (2021), Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One Strategic Policies (2012) and Policies DMHD 1, DMHB 5 and DMHB 11 of of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The proposed roof extension, by virtue of its height, bulk, form, depth, size, siting and proximity, would be detrimental to the amenities of the neighbouring occupiers at Nos. 2 and 6 Hillside Crescent, by reason of overdominance, overshadowing, loss of light, loss of outlook and creating a sense of enclosure. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policies BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan (2021) and national guidance.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service. We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
