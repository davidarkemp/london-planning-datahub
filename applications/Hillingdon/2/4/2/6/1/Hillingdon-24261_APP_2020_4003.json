  "decision_conditions": [
    "The constructed extension to the existing outbuilding, by virtue of its design, cumulative width, size, bulk and massing, has created an unduly incongruous form of development which fails to appear subordinate to the host dwelling. The development therefore has a harmful impact on the character and appearance of the host dwelling and the surrounding area, contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2019),  Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11, DMHD 1 and DMHD 2 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2016). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020."
