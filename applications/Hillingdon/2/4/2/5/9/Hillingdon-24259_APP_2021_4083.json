    "The proposed part two storey/part single storey rear extension, single storey side/rear extension and roof extension (including an increase to the main ridge height of the dwelling)  by reason of their cumulative size, scale, bulk, height and design (including the uncharacteristic crown roof profile), would result in a disproportionate and incongruous form of development that would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original dwelling, and would be detrimental to the appearance of the original host dwelling, and cause harm to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the existing street scene on Broadwood Avenue and the surrounding area.  he proposal is therefore contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012), Policies DMHD1, DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policies D1, D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framewo",
    "The proposed crown profile and increase to the main ridge height of the host dwelling would result in an unduly prominent, visually incongruous and top-heavy form of development that would be detrimental to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the existing street scene on Broadwood Avenue and the surrounding area. The proposal therefore conflicts with Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012), Policies DMHD1, DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policies D1, D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The proposed rear dormer, by reason of its excessive size, scale and bulk, coupled with its siting and design, would appear as incongruous and visually obtrusive form  of development which would significantly detract from the original roof form of the property and cause harm to the character and appearance of the surrounding area.  The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012), Policies DMHD1, DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policies D1, D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The proposed part two storey/part single storey rear extension, single storey side/rear infill extension and new roof form (including an increase to the main ridge height of the host dwelling), by reason of its proximity, depth, scale, bulk and height, would have a harmful impact on the living conditions of the occupiers at numbers 28 and 32 Broadwood Avenue and their associated private amenity space, in terms of loss of light, outlook, overdominance, sense of enclosure and overbearing impact. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012), Policies DMHD 1 and DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "In the absence of a preliminary ecology assessment, the application has failed to demonstrate that the proposal would not cause harm to protected species or whether adequate mitigation could be incorporated within the scheme as necessary. The proposal therefore conflicts with Policy DMEI 7 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Biodiversity and Geological Conservation: Circular 06/2005 and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "a) We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal.",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2016). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020."
