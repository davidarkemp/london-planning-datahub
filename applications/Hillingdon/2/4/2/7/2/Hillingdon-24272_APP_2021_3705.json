    "The proposed extension by reason of its overall size, height, crown roof design, scale, bulk and proximity to the side boundary, in conjunction with loft extensions would fail to appear subordinate to the original property and would result in a closing of the visually open gap between it and the neighbouring property, giving rise to a cramped form of development, which would be detrimental to the visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area generally. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), policies DMHB11; DMHB12 and DMHD1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan - Part One (2020) and policies D3 and D8 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "The applicant is advised that the conservatory shown on the submitted plans is not subject to a valid planning permission and may be vulnerable to enforcement action being taken by the Council."
