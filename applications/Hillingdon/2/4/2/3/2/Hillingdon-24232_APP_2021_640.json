  "description": "Conversion of roofspace to habitable use to include a rear dormer, juliette balcony, 2 x front rooflights and conversion of roof from hip to gable end including raising of roof height",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The roof alteration/extensions, by reason of the hip to gable end roof design and the size, scale, bulk, and design of the rear dormer window, in addition to the increase in the original ridge height, would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original semi-detached dwelling, would be detrimental to the character, appearance and unbalance the symmetry of the pair of semi-detached houses of which it forms a part and to the visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020)."
