    "The Hornbeam is situated within the front garden of 9 Sweetcroft Lane. Alongside other front garden trees it contributes to a collective high amenity value and to the arboreal character of Hillingdon Court Park, Area of Special Local Character.",
    "Due to the Hornbeam's proximity to other trees it is growing with a lean towards the road, however the applicant is vague about the exact extent of tree work they wish to carry out.",
    "Without a clear work description, we are unable to confirm that the proposed works will not have a detrimental impact on the visual amenity and arboreal character of the area and for this reason the application is refused. I would draw your attention to the statutory lifting informative below.",
    "Statutory crown lifting of trees: This does not require formal consent of the Council if the clearance only involves the removal of branches to give a separation between the footway and the tips of the lowest branches by up to 2.3m or the carriageway by up to 5.2m.",
    "The removal of deadwood, dangerous / hanging branches and ivy:  This does not require the formal consent of the Council."
