  "description": "Part single storey, part two storey rear extension",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed part two storey, part single storey rear extension, by virtue of its size, scale, bulk, depth, height and proximity, would be detrimental to the amenities of the adjoining occupiers at 15 and 19 Money Lane by reason of overdominance, overshadowing, visual intrusion, loss of light and loss of outlook. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies.",
    "The proposed development by reason of its size, scale, bulk, depth and roof design, would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original dwelling and would fail to either preserve or enhance the character or appearance of the surrounding West Drayton Green Conservation Area. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies BE1 and HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 1, DMHB 4, DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), Policy 7.8 of the London Plan (2016) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2019).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service."
