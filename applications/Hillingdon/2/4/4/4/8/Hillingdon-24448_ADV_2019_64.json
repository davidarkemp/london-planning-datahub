    "The proposed fascia and projecting signs, by reason of their design and means of illumination, would be detrimental to the architectural composition of the original property, would be detrimental to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the street scene and would fail to either preserve or enhance the character or appearance of the surrounding Northwood Town Centre, Green Lane Conservation Area. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies BE1 and HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies BE4, BE27 and BE29 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Saved UDP Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 1, DMHB 4 and DMHB 13A of the Emerging Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies with Modifications (March 2019) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document HDAS: Shopfronts."
