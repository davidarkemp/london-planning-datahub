    "The proposed single storey side/front extension, by reason of its siting in a visually prominent position, size, proximity to the side boundary and projection forward of the return building line on Bradshawe Waye, would result in incongruous and insubordinate form of development. Furthermore it would result in the loss of openness on the corner plot, resulting in a cramped appearance. The proposal would therefore be an unsympathetic addition and represent an overdevelopment of the site, to the detriment of the character, appearance and visual amenities of the surrounding area. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHD 1, DMHB 1, DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2016). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020."
