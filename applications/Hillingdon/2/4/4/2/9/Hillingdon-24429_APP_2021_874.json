  "description": "Conversion of garage to habitable use to include alterations to front elevation and first floor side extension",
  "application_type": "Householder",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed first floor side extension, by virtue of its size, scale, bulk and design, including the lack of a set back from the front at all levels, a set down from the ridge of the main roof and proximity to the side boundary would fail to appear as a subordinate addition, would result in a closing of the visually open gap between it and the neighbouring property, 183 Bury Street, giving rise to a cramped form of development and would thus fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original detached dwelling and would be detrimental to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2016). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service. We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
