    "The proposal, by reason of the siting of the ground floor front facing window, given its proximity to proposed cycle store, would have the potential to result in the provision of a habitable room with very restricted levels of outlook and natural lighting that would result in a substandard form of living accommodation and reliance upon artificial means of lighting which would fail to satisfy sustainability and energy efficiency objectives and would be detrimental to the residential amenity of future occupiers.  The proposal would therefore be contrary to the requirements of Policies DMH 1 and DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The proposal, by virtue of it's failure to maintain an adequate amount of private usable external amenity space for the occupiers of the proposed development, would result in an over-development of the site to the detriment of the residential amenity of existing and future occupiers. The proposal is therefore contrary to the requirements of Policies DMHB 11 and DMHB 18 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
