  "description": "Change of use from 6 room HMO (Use Class C4) to 10 room HMO (Sui Generis), including conversion of roof space to habitable use to include a rear dormer and 1 front roof light, alterations to rear elevation and addition of cycle and refuse storage",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed development, by virtue of the proposed off street parking/manoeuvring arrangements, would result in the loss of all existing amenity space and would fail to provide any amenity space of sufficient size and quality commensurate to the size and layout of the proposed development. The proposal would, thus, result in an over-development of the site detrimental to the residential amenity of existing and future occupiers. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies DMH 1, DMH 5, DMHB 11 and DMHB 18 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "The proposed off-street car parking provision would fail to provide parking spaces in accordance with the Council's adopted car parking standards and thus would result in additional on-street parking, prejudicial to highway and pedestrian safety. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policies DMT 2 and DMT 6 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The proposal, by reason of the siting of the ground floor flank bedroom window, given its proximity to the side boundary, flank wall of the adjoining property and cycle parking, would result in the provision of a habitable room with very restricted levels of outlook and natural lighting that would result in a substandard form of living accommodation and reliance upon artificial means of lighting which would fail to satisfy sustainability and energy efficiency objectives and would be to the detriment of the amenity of future occupiers, contrary to Policies DMH 1, DMH 5 and DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and Policies 3.5 and 5.3 of the London Plan (March 2016).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan - The Spatial Development Strategy for London consolidated with alterations since 2011 (2016) and national guidance."
