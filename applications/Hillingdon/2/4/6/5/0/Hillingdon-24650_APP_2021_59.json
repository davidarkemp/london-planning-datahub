  "description": "First floor rear extension with habitable roofspace to include 2 x rear rooflights.",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed development, by reason of its size, scale, bulk and design, including the mansard roof detail, represents an unduly intrusive and incongruous form of development, which would fail to harmonise with the character and appearance of the original dwelling and would fail to either preserve or enhance the character or appearance of the surrounding Ruislip Village Conservation Area. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies DMHB 4, DMHB 11, DMHB12 and DMHD 1 of the Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy HC1 of the London Plan (2021) and the NPPF (2019).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service."
