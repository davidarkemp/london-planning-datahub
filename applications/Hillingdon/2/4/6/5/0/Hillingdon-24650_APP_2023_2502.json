    "The proposed development, by reason of its size, scale, bulk and design, including the fenestration changes and resultant large crown roof, represents an unduly intrusive and incongruous form of development, which would fail to harmonise with the character and appearance of the original dwelling and would fail to preserve or enhance the appearance and character of the Ruislip Village Conservation Area. The development therefore conflicts with Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 4, DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local plan - Part Two (2020), Policies HC1 and D3 of the London Plan (2021), Paragraph 202 of the NPPF (2021) and Section 72 of the Planning (Listed buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990.",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2021). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020."
