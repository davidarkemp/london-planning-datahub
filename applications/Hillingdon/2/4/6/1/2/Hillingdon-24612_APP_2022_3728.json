    "The proposed development, by reason of its siting, depth, size, scale, massing and design (including its excessive double hipped side roof profile) would fail to harmonise with the character and architectural composition of the surrounding properties, appearing as a visually dominant, incongruous and bulky form of development which would be detrimental to the visual amenity of the street scene and harmful to the character and appearance of the surrounding area. The proposal therefore conflicts with Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One- Strategic Policies (2012) , Policies DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020), Policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The proposed development, by virtue of the poor outlook afforded to the room labelled as 'home office' which could be flexibly used as a bedroom, would result in a substandard form of internal amenity provision for the future occupants of Flat 6. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy DMHB 16 of the Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The proposed development by virtue of its proximity to the shared boundary, scale, depth, height and bulk (which includes a double hipped side roof profile), would cause harm to the living conditions of the neighbouring occupiers at number 215 Swakeleys Road and their associated private amenity space, in terms of loss of outlook, overbearing impact and sense of enclosure.  The proposal is therefore be contrary to Policy DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan - The Spatial Development Strategy for London consolidated with alterations since 2011 (2016) and national guidance.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "a) We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal.",
    "This is a reminder that Under the terms of the Planning Act 2008 (as amended) and Community Infrastructure Levy Regulations 2010 (as amended), should an application for appeal be allowed, the proposed development would be deemed as 'chargeable development' and therefore liable to pay the London Borough of Hillingdon Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and the Mayor of London's Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This would be calculated in accordance with the London Borough of Hillingdon CIL Charging Schedule 2014 and the Mayor of London's CIL Charging Schedule 2012.",
