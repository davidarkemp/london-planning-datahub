    "The proposed development, by reason of its size, scale, massing, height and design (including its excessive two-storey front projection and uncharacteristic crown roof form and dormers) would fail to harmonise with the character and architectural composition of the surrounding properties, appearing as a visually dominant, incongruous and bulky form of development which would be detrimental to the visual amenity of the street scene and harmful to the character and appearance of the surrounding area. The proposal therefore conflicts with Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One- Strategic Policies (2012) , Policies  DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020), Policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The proposed development, by virtue of the position of the on-site car parking spaces, the communal rear garden and its access route, and the lack/absence of defensible space, would cause unacceptable overlooking and a loss of privacy (both real and perceived) for the future occupants of the proposed ground floor flats. The proposal would therefore result in a substandard form of internal residential accommodation to the detriment of the amenity of the future occupiers of Flats 1, 2 and 3, contrary to Policies DMHB 15 and DMHB 16 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The proposed development, by virtue of its substandard internal floor space for the single bedrooms contained within Flats 1, 2 4 and 5, would result in substandard forms of residential accommodation to the detriment of future occupants of these proposed flats. The proposal would therefore contrary to Policy DMHB 16 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "Insufficient evidence has been provided to demonstrate that adequate refuse and recycling facilities can be provided for the existing and future occupiers of the proposed development without adversely impacting upon neighbouring residential amenity, on-site parking provision, highway safety or the ability for the Council's refuse collection crew to service the site. The proposal would therefore conflict with Policy DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The proposed development by virtue of its proximity to the shared boundary, scale, height and bulk (which includes a crown roof profile and dormers), would result in a loss of outlook for the occupiers at No. 215 when viewed from their private amenity space and would create an unacceptable sense of the enclosure and overbearing impact for the neighbouring occupiers at No. 215. The proposal would therefore result in harm to neighbouring residential amenity contrary to Policy DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan - The Spatial Development Strategy for London consolidated with alterations since 2011 (2016) and national guidance.",

    "a) We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal.",

    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "This is a reminder that Under the terms of the Planning Act 2008 (as amended) and Community Infrastructure Levy Regulations 2010 (as amended), should an application for appeal be allowed, the proposed development would be deemed as 'chargeable development' and therefore liable to pay the London Borough of Hillingdon Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and the Mayor of London's Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This would be calculated in accordance with the London Borough of Hillingdon CIL Charging Schedule 2014 and the Mayor of London's CIL Charging Schedule 2012.",
