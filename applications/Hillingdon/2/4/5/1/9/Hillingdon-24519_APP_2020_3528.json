  "description": "Conversion of single dwelling to 1 x 1-bed and 1 x 3-bed self contained residential units",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposal would provide an indoor living area of an unsatisfactory size and quality for the future occupiers of the one-bedroom self-contained residential unit, and would therefore give rise to a substandard form of living accommodation to the detriment of the amenity for future occupiers. The proposal therefore conflicts with paragraph 127 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), Policy 3.5 and Table 3.3 of the London Plan (2016) and Policy DMHB 16 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The proposed development, by virtue of its failure to demonstrate that a sufficient size and quality of rear garden space would be provided at the site, would be detrimental to the quality of accommodation for future occupiers with regard to the provision private external amenity space. The proposal therefore conflicts with paragraph 127 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2019) and Policy DMHB 18 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "Insufficient evidence has been submitted to demonstrate that the proposed development would not exacerbate the demand for street parking in the area, which in turn, would have a harmful effect on highway safety. The proposal therefore conflicts with paragraph 109 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), Policy 6.13 of the London Plan (2016) and Policies DMT 2 and DMT 6 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan - The Spatial Development Strategy for London consolidated with alterations since 2011 (2016) and national guidance.",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2016). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020."
