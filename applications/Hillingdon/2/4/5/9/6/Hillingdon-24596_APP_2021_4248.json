    "The proposed development by reason of its siting, size, scale, bulk, depth, design and projection beyond the established building lines would result in a unduly prominent, incongruous and uncharacteristic form of development which fails to respond to the established context. Consequently, the proposed development would be detrimental to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area. The proposal would therefore be contrary Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012), Policies DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two- Development Management Policies (2020), Policies D1, D3, D4 and D8 of the London Plan (2021) and Chapter 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The proposed development, by virtue of its proximity, design and layout would be detrimental to the residential amenities of the neighbouring occupiers at Flat 6F, Albany House, causing significant overlooking and harmful privacy loss. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012), Policy DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two- Development Management Policies (2020) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The proposed development, by virtue of its layout, room sizes (in terms of both floor space and ceiling heights) and insufficient provision of external and internal communal amenity space would result in substandard and poor quality student accommodation, which provides substandard accommodation to its future occupants, to the detriment of their amenity. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policy DMH 5, DMHB 16 and DMHB 18 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy D6 and Policy H15 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The Applicant has failed to demonstrate with a legal agreement, alongside a robust, independent assessment, that the proposal would secure an appropriate nomination agreement as well as provide the maximum level of accommodation as affordable student accommodation, contrary to Policy H15 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "No legal agreement is in place to prohibit future residents of the proposed development from applying to join the Councils on street parking management scheme. In the absence of such an agreement the Councils Parking Management Scheme is likely to be overrun, leading to roadside parking, congestion and reduced highway safety. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policy DMT 2 of the Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020) and T4 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate that the proposed lift would be suitable and usable for escape in the event of a fire emergency. Fire evacuation lifts should meet the requirements of BS EN 81-76, BS 9991, and/or BS 9999. The proposed development is therefore contrary to Policies D5 and D12 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan (2021).",
    "This is a reminder that Under the terms of the Planning Act 2008 (as amended) and Community Infrastructure Levy Regulations 2010 (as amended), should an application for appeal be allowed, the proposed development would be deemed as 'chargeable development' and therefore liable to pay the London Borough of Hillingdon Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and the Mayor of London's Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This would be calculated in accordance with the London Borough of Hillingdon CIL Charging Schedule 2014 and the Mayor of London's CIL Charging Schedule 2012.",
