    "Both the Oak and Thuja are situated within Raisins Hill Area of special local character and can be seen from Catlins Lane open space. The Oak can also be seen from Cuckoo Hill and is part of the historic tree cover in the area. As a result the Thuja has a moderate amenity value and the Oak has a high amenity value. Both trees contribute to the arboreal character and amenity of the area.",

There does appear to be seasonal movement but there is no evidence that this is linked to the Thuja (no roots found) and the claim assessment report makes no mention of the Thuja. The Oak tree is significantly older than the property and as a result we have received strong comments from local residents and the residents association against the application and concerns about the risk of heave.",
