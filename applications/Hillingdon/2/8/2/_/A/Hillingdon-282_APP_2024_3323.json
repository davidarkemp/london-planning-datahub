    "The cumulative scale of the extensions considered in conjunction with the approved single storey extension would be excessive and insufficiently subordinate to the host dwelling and fails to relate appropriately to the design of the existing property and the character and appearance of the surrounding street scene. The development therefore fails to comply with Policies DMHD 1; DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020); Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One Strategic Policies (2012); Policy D4 of the London Plan 2021; and the provisions of the NPPF 2024, in particular paragraphs 135 and 139.",
    "The extensions by reason of their scale, depth, siting and the position of the proposed first floor windows would fail to preserve appropriate privacy, standards of amenity and living conditions for adjoining residential occupiers as a result of a loss of light, outlook and increased overlooking and would be contrary to Policies DMHD1 and DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020); and the provisions of the NPPF 2024, in particular paragraphs 135 and 139.",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan - The Spatial Development Strategy for London consolidated with alterations since 2011 (2016) and national guidance."
