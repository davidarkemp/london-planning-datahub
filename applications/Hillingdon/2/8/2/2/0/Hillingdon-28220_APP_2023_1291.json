    "The proposed development does not constitute permitted development by virtue of the provisions of Schedule 2, Part 1, Class A.1 (j)(iii) and (ja) of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 as the proposed rear extension would extend behind and adjoin the existing garage at the side of the property (approved under planning application ref: 28220/80/0271), forming a single storey side extension. Therefore the total enlarged part of the dwellinghouse (being the enlarged part together with any existing enlargement of the original dwellinghouse to which it will be joined) would therefore extend beyond a wall forming a side elevation of the original dwellinghouse and would have a width greater than half the width of the dwellinghouse."
