    "The proposal, by reason of its excessive width, depth, siting, scale, bulk, massing and design would result in an unduly prominent, visually incongruous, disproportionate and insubordinate development that would be detrimental to the architectural composition of the original property and detrimental to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the street scene and surrounding area. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHD 1, DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), Policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021) and Paragraphs 130b and 134 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The rear balcony, by reason of its design, siting and close proximity to neighbouring properties, would result in visual intrusion and an unacceptable loss of privacy and overlooking of neighbouring properties.  The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020) and Paragraph 130f of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2016). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020."
