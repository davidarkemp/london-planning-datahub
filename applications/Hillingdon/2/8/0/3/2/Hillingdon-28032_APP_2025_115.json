    "The proposed development including the increase in roof height and side dormer by reason of its size, scale, bulk, massing and design would result in an incongruous and visually intrusive form of development that fails to appear sympathetic to the original dwelling house and the immediate street scene. The proposed development would also fail to harmonise with the established built environment on Marlborough Avenue resulting in a detrimental impact on the character and appearance of Marlborough Avenue. The proposal is, therefore, contrary Policy D3 of The London Plan (2021), Policy BE1 of Hillingdon Council's Local Plan Part One Strategic Policies (2012), and Policies DMHB 11, DHB12 and DMHD 1 of Hillingdon Council's Local Plan Part Two Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan - The Spatial Development Strategy for London consolidated with alterations since 2011 (2016) and national guidance."
