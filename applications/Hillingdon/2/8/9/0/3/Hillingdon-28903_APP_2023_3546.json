    "The proposed development would result in the loss of employment floor space which would undermine the local economy.  Insufficient  marketing evidence has been submitted to indicate that the local and physical condition of the building renders it unsuitable for employment purposes. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy E7 of London Plan 2021 and DME 2 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2023).",
    "The proposed development by reason of its backland location, materials. size, scale, bulk, massing, height and design would result in an incongruous and visually obtrusive form of development. The proposal would therefore cause significant harm to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the surrounding area and the wider Old Northwood Area of Special Local Character. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies BE1 and HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One -Strategic Policies (2012), Policies DMH 6, DMHB 5, DMHB 11, DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020), Policies HC1, D1, D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2023).",
    "The proposed development, by virtue of its proximity, scale, size, bulk, massing, height and design would cause harm to the living conditions of the neighbouring occupiers  at Nos. 79, 81 and 75 Hilliard Road and their associated private amenity space, in terms of outlook, light, privacy, overlooking, overbearing impact and sense of enclosure. The proposal therefore conflicts with Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One -Strategic Policies (2012), Policy DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2023).",
    "The proposed development, by virtue of its poor outlook and poor levels of natural light would result in substandard forms of residential accommodation to the detriment of future occupants. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy DMHB 16 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2023).",
    "The proposed development, by reason of its inadequate size, quality and functionality of external amenity space provision, would result in substandard forms of residential accommodation to the detriment of future occupants. The proposal therefore conflicts with Policy DMHB 18 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2023).",
    "The proposed development would introduce a more vulnerable use (i.e. residential accommodation) on land within a high risk area for surface water flooding.  No Flood Risk Assessment has been provided and no sequential test has been carried out. Consequently, insufficient information has been submitted regarding the risk and effects of flooding at the site, and the availability of alternative sites in areas with a lower risk of flooding. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy DMEI 9 and DMEI 10 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020),  Policies SI 12 and SI 13 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "This is a reminder that Under the terms of the Planning Act 2008 (as amended) and Community Infrastructure Levy Regulations 2010 (as amended), should an application for appeal be allowed, the proposed development would be deemed as 'chargeable development' and therefore liable to pay the London Borough of Hillingdon Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and the Mayor of London's Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This would be calculated in accordance with the London Borough of Hillingdon CIL Charging Schedule 2014 and the Mayor of London's CIL Charging Schedule 2012.",
