    "The proposed development by reason of side facing windows of bedrooms 1 and 2 and their proximity to the neighbouring properties at No.28 and 30 would result in a form of development which would not provide satisfactory amenities for that adjoining properties, due to the loss of privacy that could arise. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy DMHD 1 , DMHB 11 of the Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The proposal would provide three habitable rooms (bedrooms 1 and 2 at ground floor and bedroom 3 at first floor) with no or very poor outlook and daylight and sunlight and would therefore give rise to a substandard form of living accommodation to the detriment of the amenity of future occupiers.
