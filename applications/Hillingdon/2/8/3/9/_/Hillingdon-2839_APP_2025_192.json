    "The proposed development, by reason of the provision of facilities within the outbuilding and independent access to the outbuilding, would be tantamount to a separate self-contained residential unit in a position where such a dwelling would be unacceptable. Consequently, the proposed development would harm the area's character and appearance and the amenity of neighbouring residents. The proposal is, therefore, contrary to  the National Planning Policy Framework (2024), Policies D1, D3, D4, and D6 of the London Plan (2021), and Policies DMH 6, DMHD 2, and DMHB 11 of the  Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "Given that the proposal would necessitate the loss of  two trees within the rear garden, that the proposed outbuilding would be detrimental to the character and appearance of the surrounding area. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies D3, D4 and G7 of the London Plan (2021), Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHD1; DMHB 11, DMHB14 and DMHD 2  of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - (2020).",
    "The proposed development has failed to demonstrate that it would provide an adequate level of outlook for the future occupier of the bedroom due to its reliance solely on rooflight, which is set at high level. The proposal would therefore give rise to a substandard form of living accommodation to the detriment of the amenities of future occupier contrary to Policy DMHB 11 and Policy DMHB16 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
