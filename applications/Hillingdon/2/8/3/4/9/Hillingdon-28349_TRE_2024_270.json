    "The Lawson Cypress (G5 on TPO 150) are situated on the boundary of Viceroy Court and Carew Road. The trees appear in good condition, are situated in a prominent position and are visible to passing vehicles and pedestrians. The trees do not appear to have been pruned before, and as a result have attractive conical crowns, typical of the species. They contribute to the arboreal nature of the area and provide a moderate amenity value.",
    "This application has been refused as there has been no valid arboricultural reason for the work provided. The proposed 6-meter crown reduction would remove the dominant leaders, potentially causing the growth of multiple new leaders. This could result in weak points forming within the crowns of the trees, increasing the likelihood of multiple failures during future wind events. Consequently, the proposed work may harm the trees health, appearance, and their characteristic conical shape, which is typical of this species. Additionally, the reduction would dim",
    "The removal of deadwood, dangerous / hanging branches and ivy:  This does not require the formal consent of the Council.",
    "Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981:  Note that it is an offence under this act to disturb roosting bats, nesting birds or any other protected species.  Therefore, if applicable, it is advisable to consult your tree surgeon / consultant to agree an acceptable time for carrying out the approved works.",
    "Owner(s)'s permission:  Permission should be sought from the owner(s) of the tree(s) and / or the owner(s) of the land that the tree(s) overhang prior to any approved work being carried out.",
    "Expected standard of tree work: The approved works must be carried out in accordance with the conditions laid out above. If they are not, then enforcement action could being taken which could lead to prosecution and heavy fines. Therefore, it is highly recommended that the works are only carried out by a professional and competent arboriculturist who undertakes to comply with the conditions of this consent and in accordance with industry best practice (BS 3998:2010). The Arboricultural Association can provide details of its approved contractors, who have demonstrated such professionalism and competence, on their website (www.trees.org.uk) or by calling 01242 522152. Or on request the Council can provide a list of contractors who are known to carry out tree work to a good standard and to normally maintain an appropriate policy of indemnity insurance."
