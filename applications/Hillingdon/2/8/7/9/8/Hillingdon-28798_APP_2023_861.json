    "The proposed ground floor rear extension, by reason of  design, scale, size, bulk and massing, would appear as a disproportionate and incongruous addition that would fail to respect the architectural composition of the original dwelling, and would be detrimental to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the surrounding area. The proposal would therefore be contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020) and Policy D4 of the London Plan (2021).",
