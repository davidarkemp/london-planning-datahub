    "The proposed ground floor rear extension, by reason of its excessive depth, design and bulk would appear as a disproportionate and incongruous addition that would fail to respect the architectural composition or size of the original dwelling. The extension is therefore considered to be detrimental to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the host property. Due to its oversized design it would also be harmful to character of the surrounding area where extensions are generally smaller. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021) and paragraph 130 of the NPPF (2021).",
