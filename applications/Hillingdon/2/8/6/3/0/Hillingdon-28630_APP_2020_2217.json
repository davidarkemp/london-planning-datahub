  "description": "Two storey side extension and part two storey, part single storey rear extension with alterations to rear elevation reducing the size of the rear dormer",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed first floor rear extension by reason of its size, scale, bulk, depth, design and awkward juxtaposition with the altered roof extension, would fail to appear as a subordinate addition and would thus fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original dwelling, would be detrimental to the character and appearance of the existing property and to the visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "The proposed two storey side extension by reason of its roof design would add significant bulk and massing to the first floor of the existing property in conjunction with the altered roof extension and proposed first floor rear extension. As such the extension would appear as an overly dominant and insubordinate addition which would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original dwelling, would be detrimental to the character and appearance of the existing property and to the visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2016). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020."
