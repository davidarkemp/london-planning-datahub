    "The proposed extension, by virtue of its size, scale, bulk, height, width and proximity, would be detrimental to the amenities of the neighbouring occupiers at No. 5 Lodore Green, by reason of over-dominance, overshadowing, visual intrusion, loss of light and loss of outlook. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the adopted Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The proposed development, in combination with the existing extensions,  by reason of the cumulative size, scale, bulk, width, and design would be an overly-dominant and incongruous development which would be detrimental to the architectural composition of the original dwelling and to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the surrounding area. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the adopted Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021) and Chapter 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
