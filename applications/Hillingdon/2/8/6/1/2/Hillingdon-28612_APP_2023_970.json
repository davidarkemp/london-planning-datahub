    "The proposed single storey front, by reason of its size, scale, siting and proximity is considered to be an overbearing and visually intrusive addition that would result in a loss of outlook and loss of light resulting in harm the residential amenities of the adjoining occupiers at No. 7 Lodore Green and would therefore be contrary to Policy DMHD 1 of the Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The proposed single storey front extension, by reason of its size, scale, bulk and design would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original dwelling and would be detrimental to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies.(January 2020), Policy D3 of the London Plan (2020) and Chapter 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant policies in the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020)., then London Plan Policies (2016).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020). Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service. We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
