    "The development would lead to the unacceptable subdivision and loss of a small single family unit for which there is an established need in the Borough. The development would therefore be contrary to policies DMH 2 and DMH 4 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "The proposal would provide an indoor living area of an unsatisfactory size and head height for the future occupiers of the proposed units and would therefore give rise to a substandard form of living accommodation to the detriment of the amenity of future occupiers. The proposal is thus contrary to DMHB 16 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021) and the Technical Housing Standards - Nationally Described Space Standard (March 2015).",
    "The proposal has not demonstrated that sufficient off street parking/manoeuvring arrangements would be provided, and therefore the development is considered to result in substandard car parking provision, leading to on-street parking/queuing to the detriment of public and highway safety and contrary to policies DMT 2 and DMT 6 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020) and to Hillingdon's Adopted Parking Standards as set out in Appendix C of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020) and Policy T6 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "The roof alteration/extensions and first floor flat roofed rear extension, by reason of the size, scale, bulk, and width of the rear dormer window and flat roofed design of the rear extension, would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original property and would be detrimental to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate with the submission of accurate plans, elevation and sections the full extent of the proposed works including the position and design of the access stair and the relationship to the existing structures to the rear of the neighbouring properties. As such the proposal would be contrary to Policy DMHB11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan - Part Two (January 2020).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
