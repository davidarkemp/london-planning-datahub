    "The development, by reason of its siting, design and layout, would fail to harmonise with the prevailing development pattern of the street scene and would appear as an cramped addition that would impact the overall visual openness of the plot, resulting in harm to the character and appearance of the area and the wider street scene. The development is therefore contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012), Policies DMH 6, DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2023).",
    "The development, by virtue of its design, siting and proximity, would result in neighbouring occupiers experiencing loss of outlook, overlooking, loss of privacy and visual intrusion. Furthermore, in the absence of a daylight and sunlight assessment, the application has failed to demonstrate that the proposed development would not lead to an unacceptable loss of light or significant overshadowing to both adjoining neighbouring properties. The development would harm the residential amenity of the area and therefore conflicts with Policies DMHB 11 and DMHB 18 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021) and Paragraph 135f) of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023).",
    "The development, by reason of the proposed shared parking provision within the boundary of the proposed dwelling, would result in an unacceptable impact on privacy and disturbance to the future occupiers of the proposed dwelling and therefore conflicts with Policies DMHB 11 and DMHB 18 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021) and Paragraph 135f) of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023).",
    "The proposal, by reason of the close proximity of the 'private' tree and street tree, and by virtue of the development and widening the crossover has failed to demonstrate that the development will safeguard the protection and long-term retention of the existing trees. The proposal would, thus, result in harm to and potential loss of the tree to the detriment of the character and appearance of the street scene and the wider area contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12, DMHB 14 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two- Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "a) We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
