    "The constructed two storey side/rear extension, by virtue of its width, size, scale and height (including the absence of any set-down from the main ridge height of the host dwelling when view from the front elevation), appears as a disproportionate and incongruous addition that fails to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original dwelling, and detrimental to the character, appearance and symmetry of the row of terrace properties it forms a part and to the visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012), Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and the National Planning Framework (2021).",
    "The proposed development would provide an indoor living area of an unsatisfactory quality and size for the future occupiers of the proposed residential unit contained within the existing two storey side/rear extension. Consequently, the proposed development would  give rise to a substandard form of living accommodation to the detriment of the amenity of future occupiers. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy DMHB 16 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy D6 of the London Plan and the National Planning Framework (2021).",
    "The proposed development, by virtue of its failure to provide private external amenity space of a sufficient size and quality, would give rise to a substandard form of living accommodation to the detriment of the amenity of existing and future occupiers at the site. The proposal",
    "therefore conflicts with Policy DMHB 18 of of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020) and the  National Planning Framework (2021).",
    "Insufficient evidence has been submitted to demonstrate that the proposed development would not severely exacerbate the demand for street parking in the area leading to increased instances of dangerous and illegal parking, which in turn, would result in congestion and",
    "harmful highway safety implications. The proposal therefore conflicts with Policies DMT 1, DMT 2 and DMT 6 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policies T6 and T6.1 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Framework (2021).",

    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan - The Spatial Development Strategy for London consolidated with alterations since 2011 (2016) and national guidance.",
