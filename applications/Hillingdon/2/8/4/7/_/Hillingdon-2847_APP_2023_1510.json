    "Due to its size, siting and position, the proposed dwelling would form an uncharacteristic, cramped and visually incongruous form of development which would fail to harmonise with the established character of the area and appearance of the street scene. The proposal would therefore be detrimental to the visual amenities of the streetscene and character of the Conservation Area, contrary to Policy BE1 and HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012), DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021), as well as paragraphs 130 (a) and (c) of the NPPF (2021).",

    "The proposed development, by virtue of its excessive bulk and mass to the rear elevation and limited separation distances from the site boundary, would provide an unacceptable residential environment would cause significant harm to the residential amenities of the neighbouring occupiers at 194 Cowley Road through loss of light and overbearing impact, contrary to Policy DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020) and paragraph 130 (f) of the NPPF (2021).",
    "In the absence of a legal agreement to cover restricting parking permits to future occupiers of the proposed dwelling which are located within a permit-controlled area, the proposed development is likely to lead to an increase in pressure for on-street parking and have a consequent adverse effect on highway safety, through inconsiderate and potential hazardous parking and a risk to road users. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policy DMT 1, DMT 2 and DMT 6 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020), Policies T4, T6 and T6.1 of the London Plan (2021) and paragraph 111 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
