    "The proposed development by virtue of the use class and operation proposed, would result in an overconcentration of restricted uses within a designated Town Centre and Primary Shopping Area. As such the proposed development would result in detrimental harm to the vitality of both the Town Centre and Primary Shopping Area thus would fail to comply with Policies DMTC 2, DMTC 3 and DMTC 4 of the Hillingdon Local Plan - Part Two (2020), SD6 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "The proposed development by virtue of the excessive hours of operation proposed, would result in an unacceptable increase in noise and disturbance within an area where there is also a high concentration of residential properties, particularly in the early hours of the morning when the High Street will be at it's quietest, to the detriment of the amenity of adjoining residents, contrary to Policy DMTC 4 and DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan - The Spatial Development Strategy for London consolidated with alterations since 2011 (2016) and national guidance.",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2016). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
