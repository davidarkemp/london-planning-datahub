    "The proposed development, by reason of its provision of facilities and the availability of independent access to it, is considered capable of independent occupation from the main dwelling. As a result, the proposal would be tantamount to a separate self-contained residential unit  in a position where such a dwelling would be unacceptable, due to requirements for parking and amenity space and the impact on adjoining properties. The proposal therefore conflicts with Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 16 and  DMHB 18, DMT 2 and DMT 6 of the  Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policies D6 and T6 of the London Plan (2021) and paragraphs 109 and 127 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2019) .",
    "The use of the existing outbuilding as a self-contained residential unit would have a detrimental impact on the living conditions of neighbouring residents as a result of an undue, adverse, increase in the number of comings and goings and intensification in the use of the site as a whole, leading to an unacceptable increase in noise and disturbance for neighbouring residents. The proposal therefore conflicts with Policy DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and paragraph 127 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2019).",
    "The use of the existing outbuilding as a self-contained residential unit would result in a form of development that would be out of character with the local area. The proposal would therefore set an unacceptable precedent and cause harm to the character of the locality, contrary to Policies DMHB 2 and DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 Development Management Policies (2020) and Policies D1 and D4 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "The proposal would provide an indoor living area of an unsatisfactory size and quality and would result in the provision of habitable rooms (bedroom and study) without any natural light or outlook and would therefore give rise to a substandard form of living accommodation to the detriment of the amenity of future occupiers. The proposal is thus contrary to Policy DMHB 16 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy D6 and Table 3.1 of the London Plan (2021), the Mayor of London's adopted Supplementary Planning Guidance - Housing (March 2016) and the Technical Housing Standards - Nationally Described Space Standard (March 2015).",
    "The use of the existing outbuilding as a self-contained residential unit would provide future occupiers with no private amenity space provision, and would therefore give rise to a substandard form of living accommodation to the detriment of the amenity of future occupiers. The proposal therefore conflicts with Policy DMHB 18 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021) and paragraph 127 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2019).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2016). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020."
