  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposal extensions by reason of their combined and excessive scale, bulk, width, size and siting would result in an over development of the site which would fail to read as a subordinate to the host property, harming the original design and appearance of the host property and failing to preserve or enhance the character and appearance of the Eastcote Morford Close Conservation Area. Therefore, the proposal fails to comply with Policies HE1 and BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHD 1, DMHB 4, DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021) and Chapter 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The proposed wall and associated archway by reason of its siting, design and appearance would represent an unsympathetic and incongruous form of development which would fail to preserve or enhance the character and appearance of the site, street scene and Eastcote Morford Close Conservation Area, all contrary to Policies BE1 and HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One Strategic Policies (2012) and Policies DMHD 1, DHMB 4, DHMB 11 and DHMB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020)",
    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate, with the submission of an Arboricultural Impact Assessment and Method Statement, that the trees and other vegetation, which make a valuable contribution to the amenity of the Conservation Area, can and will be retained on site and not damaged during construction works. The applicant has not provided information appropriate to ensure that trees can be satisfactorily retained on the site and as such the proposal is contrary to policies DMHB 11 and DMHB 14 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 (2020) and Policies G5, G6 and G7 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2021). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020."
