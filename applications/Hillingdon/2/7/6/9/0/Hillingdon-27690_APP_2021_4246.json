  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposal by virtue of the size, scale, design, profile, bulk and lack of detail would result in a discordant and intrusive addition that would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original building and terrace. The roof extension fails to respect the transition between the residential properties to the south and the terrace of properties of which it forms a part and subsequently the visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area. The rear extension projects beyond the rear building line and results in a incongruous addition to the rear of the terrace. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "The proposal fails to demonstrate that the new extract flue would not give rise to unacceptable levels of noise, disturbance and/or odour to surrounding residential occupiers. In the absence of any noise and/or odour surveys, or appropriate mitigation measures, the proposed development is considered to result in potential harm to the residential amenities of adjoining occupiers, contrary to Policies DMHB 11 and DMTC 4 of the Hillingdon Local Plan - Part Two (2020) and Policy D14 of the London plan (2021).",
    "The proposal would provide an indoor living area of an unsatisfactory quality for the future occupiers of the proposed dwellings and would therefore give rise to a substandard form of living accommodation to the detriment of the amenity of future occupiers. The proposal is thus contrary to Policies DMHB11 and DMHB16 of the Hillingdon Local Plan - Part Two (2020) and Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal.",
    "This is a reminder that Under the terms of the Planning Act 2008 (as amended) and Community Infrastructure Levy Regulations 2010 (as amended), should an application for appeal be allowed, the proposed development would be deemed as 'chargeable development' and therefore liable to pay the London Borough of Hillingdon Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and the Mayor of London's Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This would be calculated in accordance with the London Borough of Hillingdon CIL Charging Schedule 2014 and the Mayor of London's CIL Charging Schedule 2012.",
