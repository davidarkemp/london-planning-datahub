The limit values are intended to be consistent with the evidence base that is reflected in guidance: 'Guidance on Sound Insulation and Noise Reduction for Buildings' BS8233 2014. This is combined with the assessment principles and procedures detailed in guidance: 'Methods for rating and assessing industrial and commercial sound' British Standards Institution BS4142 2014.'
