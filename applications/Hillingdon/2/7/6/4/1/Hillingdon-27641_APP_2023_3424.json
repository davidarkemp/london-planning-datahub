    "The applicant failed to support the proposed change of use from C3 (residential) to C1 (Bed and Breakfast) outside of a town centre with an appropriate sequential test. It is, therefore, unacceptable and contrary to Paragraph 91 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023), Policy E10 of The London Plan, and Paragraph 2.24 of Hillingdon Council's Local Plan Part 2 Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The proposed change of use from C3 (residential) to C1 (Bed and Breakfast) would result in an unjustified loss of a family-sized dwelling house, contrary to Policy DMH 1 and Paragraph 4.6 of Hillingdon Council's Local Plan Part 2 Development Management Policies (2020), which indicate a substantial borough-wide requirement for larger private market units, particularly three-bedroom properties.",
    "The application fails to consider and appropriately mitigate the contamination impacts the development could have on the potentially contaminated land on which the site is. The application is therefore unacceptable and contrary to Policy 15 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023) and Policy DMEI 12 of Hillingdon Council's Local Plan Part Two Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The application fails to consider and appropriately mitigate the potential archaeological impacts of the development on the two Archaeological Priority Areas in which it would be located. Therefore, it is unacceptable and contrary to Policy 16 of the NPPF (2023), Policy HC1 of the London Plan, and Policy DMHB 7 of Hillingdon Council's Local Plan Part Two Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The proposal would have inadequate and inappropriate vehicle access, onsite turning, drop-off, and parking provision, adversely affecting the free flow of High Street traffic and causing detrimental obstruction and highway safety hazards. It is, therefore, unacceptable and contrary to Policy 9 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023), Policies T2 and T5 of the London Plan (2021), and Policies DME 5, DMT1, DMT2, and DMT6 of Hillingdon Council's Local Plan Part Two Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The proposal would, by its depth, bulk, height, location, and orientation, result in a built form which would be harmful to the amenities of the neighbouring occupiers at 335 High Street and the private amenity space to the rear of the application site, through loss of light, outlook, and privacy, contrary to Policies DMHD 1 and DMHB 11 of Hillingdon Council's Local Plan Part Two Development Management Policies (2020), which seek to protect residential amenity.",
    "The proposed dormer would be larger than the first-floor rear windows, and the single-storey rear extension would not include a parapet. Thus, the proposed development would be contrary to Policy DMHB 1 and Paragraph A1.21 of Hillingdon Council's Local Plan Part Two Development Management Policies (2020) and unacceptable within the Conservation Area."
