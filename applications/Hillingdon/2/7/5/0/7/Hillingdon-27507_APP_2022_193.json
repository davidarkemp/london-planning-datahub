  "description": "Single storey side and rear extension following the demolition of existing side garage and rear extension, hip to gable extension (following removal of part of the side roof),   rear dormer roof extension (including conversion into habitable space), rooflights and erection of porch.",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed hip to gable extension alongside rear dormer, by reason of the uncharacteristic roof transition, combined height, width and depth, including siting of the rear dormer would result in a boxy, top heavy, bulky, dominant, disproportionate and visually intrusive form of development that would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original dwelling, would unbalance the relationship with the adjacent and nearby similar styled properties along The Greenway of which it forms a part, and would be detrimental to the character and appearance of the streetscene and surrounding area. Therefore, the proposal would be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012) and Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "In the absence of a Flood Risk Assessment and appropriate flood risk mitigation measures, the proposal has failed to demonstrate that the site is safe and flood risk is suitably mitigated through the provision of an appropriate flood risk assessment/measures. Therefore, the proposal would be contrary to Policies SI12 and SI13 of the London Plan (2020), Policies EM6 and BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1- Strategic Policies (2012) and Policy DMEI 9 Management of Flood Risk in Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2021). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020."
