    "The proposed intensification of the use of the site resulting from additional cars parked at the site with additional customer, staff and delivery activity, by reason of their associated vehicle movements and scale of activities involved would result in an unacceptable increase in noise and general disturbance to the detriment of the amenities of nearby residential properties. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy EM8 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policy DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020) and Policy D14 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "In the absence of a robust Transport Assessment, the applicant has failed to demonstrate that the development will not have a detrimental impact on the free flow of traffic and highway safety, contrary to Policies DMT 1, DMT 2 and DMT6 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020) and the aims of national planning guidance contained in the National Planning Policy Framework (2012).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan - The Spatial Development Strategy for London consolidated with alterations since 2011 (2016) and national guidance.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
