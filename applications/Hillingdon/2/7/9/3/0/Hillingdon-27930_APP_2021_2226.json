    "The proposed single storey rear extension, by virtue of its size, scale, bulk, excessive depth and proximity, would be detrimental to the amenities of the adjoining occupiers at 112 Exmouth Road by reason of overdominance, overshadowing, visual intrusion, loss of outlook and loss of light. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The proposed front extension by reason of its size, scale, bulk and excessive width adjoining the side extension would result in an incongruous addition that would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original dwelling and would be detrimental to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
