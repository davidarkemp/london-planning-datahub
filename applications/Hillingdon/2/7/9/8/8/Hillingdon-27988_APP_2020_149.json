    "The proposed front extension, by reason of its size, scale and width, would represent a visually unsympathetic form of development that would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original and extended dwelling, would be detrimental to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the street scene and the wider Copsewood Estate Area of Special Local Character. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies BE1 and HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies  DMHB 1, DMHB 5, DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy 7.8 of the London Plan (2016) and the NPPF.",

    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan - The Spatial Development Strategy for London consolidated with alterations since 2011 (2016) and national guidance.",
