  "decision_conditions": [
    "The existing outbuilding, by reason of its provision of facilities required for day-to-day private domestic existence and the availability of independent access to it, has resulted in the creation of a self-contained residential unit in a backland position where such a dwelling is unacceptable, due to the requirements of internal and external amenity space for occupiers, detrimental impact on the character and appearance of the area,  harmful to the living conditions of neighbouring occupiers and harmful effect to the character of the area. The proposal  therefore conflicts with Policies DMH 6, DMHD 2, DMHB 11, DMHB 12, DMHB 16, DMHB 18, DMT 6 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policies D3, D4, D6, D8, T6 and T6.1 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "By virtue of the use of the existing outbuilding as a self-contained residential unit and the physical sub-division of the application site, the development represents and inappropriate and alien form of backland development that fails to reflect the established pattern of development in the local area. The proposal has therefore caused harm to the character and appearance of the area, contrary to Policies DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020), Policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "By virtue of its proximity, siting and self-contained residential use and access arrangements, the outbuilding has caused harm to the living conditions of the existing occupiers of the main property at number 14 Devon Way and the neighbouring occupiers at number 12 Devon Way and their respective private amenity space, in terms of noise and disturbance. The timber fencing that has been erected to subdivide the outbuilding from the main property has not mitigate this identified harm. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "By reason of its poor levels of outlook, the existing outbuilding (which is being used as self-contained residential unit), has resulted in a substandard form of internal living accommodation to the  detriment of the amenity of its occupiers. The proposal, therefore, conflicts, with Policy DMHB 16 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The existing outbuilding (which is being used as a self-contained residential unit) has no private useable amenity space provision, and has therefore resulted in a substandard form of external living accommodation to the detriment of the amenity of its occupiers. The proposal, therefore, conflicts, with Policy DMHB 18 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "In the absence of a legal agreement to prohibit the issuing of parking permits to the occupiers of the site which is located within a permit-controlled area, the occupiers of the  House in Multiple Occupation and occupiers of the outbuilding which is being used as a self-contained residential unit, is likely to lead to an increase in pressure for on-street parking and have a consequent adverse effect on highway safety, through inconsiderate and potential hazardous parking and a risk to road users. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policy DMT 1, DMT 2 and DMT 6 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020), Policies T4, T6 and T6.1 of the London Plan (2021) and paragraph 111 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan - The Spatial Development Strategy for London consolidated with alterations since 2011 (2016) and national guidance.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "a) We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal.",
    "This is a reminder that Under the terms of the Planning Act 2008 (as amended) and Community Infrastructure Levy Regulations 2010 (as amended), should an application for appeal be allowed, the proposed development would be deemed as 'chargeable development' and therefore liable to pay the London Borough of Hillingdon Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and the Mayor of London's Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This would be calculated in accordance with the London Borough of Hillingdon CIL Charging Schedule 2014 and the Mayor of London's CIL Charging Schedule 2012.",
