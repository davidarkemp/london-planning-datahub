The development therefore fails to comply with Policies DMHD 1; DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020); Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One Strategic Policies (2012); Policy D4 of the London Plan 2021; and the provisions of the NPPF, in particular paragraphs 135 and 139."
