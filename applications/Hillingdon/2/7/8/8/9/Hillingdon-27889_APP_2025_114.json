    "The siting, cumulative scale, and contrasting design of the extensions fail to relate appropriately to the character and design of the host property as well as the character of the area and adjoining street scene by reason of the inappropriate and uncoordinated design of the extensions and loss of openness between the plot and the adjoining property. The development therefore fails to comply with the provisions of the NPPF (2024), Policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021), Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One Strategic Policies (2012), and Policies DMHD 1, DMHB 11, and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service. . This is a resubmission of a previously refused scheme, where the Officers Report identified issues to be addressed, which were reflected in the reasons for refusal, allowing the opportunity to address those issues within this submission."
