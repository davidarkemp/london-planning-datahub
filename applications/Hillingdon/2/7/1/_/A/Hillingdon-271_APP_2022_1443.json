    "The retention of the external retractable canopy, outdoor gazebos together with the outdoor TVs, by reason of their siting within the curtilage of the Grade II Listed Public House and their cumulative number, scale, design and use of materials, is harmful to the character, appearance and setting of the Grade II Listed Public House, to the visual amenities of the area and fails to enhance or preserve the character and appearance of the Eastcote Village Conservation Area. Furthermore, there are no identified public benefits that outweigh the less than substantial harm to these heritage assets. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies HE1 and BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One Strategic Policies (2012), Policies DMHB 1, DMHB 2, DMHB 4, and DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020), Policies D3 and HC1 of the London Plan (2021), and Chapters 12 and 16 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The retention of the external retractable canopy, outdoor gazebos and outdoor TVs results in an outdoor area that is detrimental to the residential amenity of neighbouring occupiers by reason of increased noise and disturbance associated with its use. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012), Policies DMHB 11 and DMTC 4 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policies D3 and D14 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan (2021) and national guidance.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service."
