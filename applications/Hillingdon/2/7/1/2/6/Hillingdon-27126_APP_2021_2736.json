    "The proposed part two storey rear extension, by reason of its cumulative width, scale, bulk, design and introduction of a second hipped roof form, would diminish the appearance of the original projecting hipped roof form harming the original design of the property. Furthermore, the part two storey rear extension would disrupt the shared architectural language  at the back of the semi-detached properties at numbers 34 and 36 Milton Court. Furthermore, the proposal would be detrimental to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the area and would fail to either preserve or enhance the character or appearance of the surrounding Ickenham Village Conservation Area. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies BE1 and HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 1, DMHB 4, DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), Policies D1, D4 and HC1 of the London Plan (2021) an",
    "The proposed rendering of the existing property and proposed extensions in a smooth white render would substantially harm and alter the appearance and symmetry of the semi-detached pair of dwellings at numbers 34 and 36 Milton Court, which are well defined by their natural pebble dash rendered elevations. Consequently, the proposed smooth white render finish would be detrimental to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the area and would fail to either preserve or enhance the character or appearance of the surrounding Ickenham Village Conservation Area. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies BE1 and HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 1, DMHB 4, DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), Policies D1, D4 and HC1 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
