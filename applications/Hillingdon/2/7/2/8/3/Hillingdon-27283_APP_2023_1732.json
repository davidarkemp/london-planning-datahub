  "decision_conditions": [
    "The development would result in the provision of a habitable room with very poor levels of outlook, limited levels of natural daylight and sunlight and poor levels of privacy, which would fail to provide adequate living conditions for future occupiers. The development is therefore contrary to Policy DMHB 16 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021) and Paragraph 135f) of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023).",
    "In the absence of a historic planning permission or lawful certificate, the proposed subdivision of the property into self-contained units has not been established. As such, the existing ground floor flats would provide an indoor living area of an unsatisfactory size and quality for the future occupiers of the proposed units and would therefore give rise to a substandard form of living accommodation to the detriment of the amenity of future occupiers. The proposal is thus contrary to Policies DMH 4 and DMHB 16 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), Policy D6 and Table 3.1 of the London Plan (2021) and the Technical Housing Standards - Nationally Described Space Standard.",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2021). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
