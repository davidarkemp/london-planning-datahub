    "The proposed first floor side extension, by virtue of its design, scale, bulk, siting and proximity to the side boundary, would result in a cramped, incongruous and awkward addition that fails to appear subordinate and harmonise with the architectural composition of the original dwellinghouse and also results in the unacceptable closure of the undeveloped gap between this and the adjoining property, No. 51 Hillingdon Hill, creating a terracing effect. The proposal would therefore be detrimental to the character of the original property and the visual amenities of the street scene, contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "This is a reminder that Under the terms of the Planning Act 2008 (as amended) and Community Infrastructure Levy Regulations 2010 (as amended), should an application for appeal be allowed, the proposed development would be deemed as 'chargeable development' and therefore liable to pay the London Borough of Hillingdon Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and the Mayor of London's Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This would be calculated in accordance with the London Borough of Hillingdon CIL Charging Schedule 2014 and the Mayor of London's CIL Charging Schedule 2012.",
