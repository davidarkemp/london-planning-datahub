    "The proposal, by reason of the number of units, layout, design, aspect and arrangement would represent and overdevelopment of the site of which would result in sub-standard and poor quality living accommodation for future occupiers, alongside a harmful loss of family accommodation. Therefore, the proposal would be contrary to Policies D1, D3, D4 and H2 of the London Plan (2021), Policies BE1 and H1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012) and Policies DMH 4, DMH 6, DMHB 5, DMBH 11, DMHB 12, DMHB 14, DMHB 18 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and Section 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The proposed sub-dvision of the rear garden alongside the number of units, by reason of the arrangement and design would result in an incongruous, visually intrusive and uncharacterstic alteration of which would impact the character and pattern of development along this side of Station Road. Therefore, the proposal would be contrary to Policies D1, D3, D4 and H2 of the London Plan (2021), Policies BE1 and H1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012) and Policies DMH 6, DMBH 11, DMHB 12, DMHB 14, DMHB 18 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and Section 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "No legal agreement is in place to prohibit future residents of the proposed development from applying to join the Councils on street parking management scheme. In the absence of such an agreement the Councils Parking Management Scheme is likely to be overrun, leading to roadside parking, congestion and reduced highway safety. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policy DMT 2 of the Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020) and T4 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "In the absence of an arboricultural report and associated method statement, the proposal has failed to ensure the protection of TPO trees on and adjacent to the site. Therefore, the proposal would fail to comply with Policies D1, D4 and G7 of the London Plan (2021), Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012) and Policies DMHB 14 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "This is a reminder that Under the terms of the Planning Act 2008 (as amended) and Community Infrastructure Levy Regulations 2010 (as amended), should an application for appeal be allowed, the proposed development would be deemed as 'chargeable development' and therefore liable to pay the London Borough of Hillingdon Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and the Mayor of London's Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This would be calculated in accordance with the London Borough of Hillingdon CIL Charging Schedule 2014 and the Mayor of London's CIL Charging Schedule 2012. For more information on CIL matters please visit the planning portal page at: www.planningportal.gov.uk/planning/applications/howtoapply/whattosubmit/cil",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2021). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020."
