    "The proposal would provide an indoor living area of an unsatisfactory size for the occupiers of a 1 bedroom flat. The proposal would therefore give rise to a substandard form of living accommodation to the detriment of the amenities of future occupiers. The proposal is thus contrary to Policy 3.5 and Table 3.3 of the London Plan (2016), the Housing Standards Minor Alterations to The London Plan (March 2016), the Mayor of London's adopted Supplementary Planning Guidance - Housing (March 2016) and the Technical Housing Standards - Nationally Described Space Standard (March 2015).",
    "The proposal would result in the provision of habitable rooms with very poor levels of outlook, ventilation and natural light/sunlight. The proposal would therefore give rise to a substandard form of living accommodation to the detriment of the amenities of future occupiers, contrary to Policies 3.5 and 5.3 of the London Plan 2015, Policies  BE19, BE20 and BE21 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Saved UDP Policies (November 2012), the Mayor of London's adopted Supplementary Planning Guidance - Housing (March 2016) and the Council's adopted Supplementary Planning Document HDAS: Residential Layouts.",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant saved policies (referred to as policies from the Hillingdon Unitary Development Plan - Saved Policies September 2007), then London Plan Policies (2016).  On the 8th November 2012 Hillingdon's Full Council agreed the adoption of the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies. Appendix 5 of this explains which saved policies from the old Unitary Development (which was subject to a direction from Secretary of State in September 2007 agreeing that the policies were 'saved') still apply for development control decisions.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the 'Saved' UDP 2007, Local Plan Part 1, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service."
