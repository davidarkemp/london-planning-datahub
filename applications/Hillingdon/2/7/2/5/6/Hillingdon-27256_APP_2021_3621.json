    "The submitted lighting plan indicates the proposed technical lighting contours. Due to the rural location of this site, the lighting should be designed to minimise any disturbance to bats and other insects, birds and animals that are active during the hours of darkness. A joint Guidance Note 08/18, by the Institute of Lighting Professionals and the Bat Conservation Trust, recommends that light spillage / pollution should be controlled. The LED's should be a warmer white (orange / yellow) with a colour temperature of <3,000 Kelvin, with minimal UV output."
