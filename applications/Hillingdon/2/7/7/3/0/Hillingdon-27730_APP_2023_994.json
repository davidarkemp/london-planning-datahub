    "The proposed development represents inappropriate development within the Green Belt. No very special circumstances have been demonstrated to outweigh the developments substantial harm to the Green Belt and other harm identified. The development is therefore harmful to the Green Belt and contrary to the aims of Policy EM2 of the Local Plan Part 1 (2012), Policy DMEI 14 of The Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy G2 of the London Plan (2021) and paragraphs 147, 148, 149 and 150 of the NPPF (2021).",
    "The proposed application fails to demonstrate that the proposed development is not causing harm in relation to Air Quality given its location within an Air Quality Management Area.  Furthermore the proposal fails to demonstrate appropriate reductions in emissions to sustain compliance with and contribute towards meeting EU limit values and national air quality objectives for pollutants and therefore cannot be considered Air Quality Neutral.  As such the proposal fails to accord with Policy DMEI 14 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2: Development Management Policies (January 2020) and Policy SI 1 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "No Preliminary Ecological Appraisal (ecological impact assessment) has been submitted in support of the proposed development. As such the applicant has failed to demonstrate that the proposed development would have an acceptable ecological impact  with regards to protected species and important habitats within and surrounding the site. Nor has it been demonstrated that any necessary mitigation measures have been put in place to offset/manage any adverse ecological impacts caused by the development. The application therefore fails to appropriately assess the provisions of the Conservation of Habitats and Species Regulations 2017 and is contrary to policy DMEI7 of the Hillingdon Local Plan - Development Management Policies (2020), as well as relevant guidance in the NPPF (2021).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan (2021) and national guidance."
