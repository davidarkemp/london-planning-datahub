  "description": "To carry out tree surgery including a crown reduction by 3m to One Oak T31 on TPO 85A",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The Oak tree is situated within the rear garden of 4 Arden Mhor and backs onto Catlins Lane. This tree forms part of a line of mature trees within back gardens along Catlins Lane which as a group has a high amenity value. The benefit in amenity and biodiversity afforded by this Oak is both present and future because it has the potential for a long-life expectancy.",
    "No previous applications to reduce this tree have been received and as a result the Oak has an attractive natural crown. A three-metre reduction along with an undefined amount of crown thinning would unnecessarily introduce large multiple wounds into its crown, which would likely cause stress and lead to infection, affecting the Oaks long-term health; this would affect the safe useful life expectancy of the tree. Pruning would also result in weakly attached re-growth forming that would be prone to future failure.",
    "Having regard to the reasons given for the proposed work, the work is unjustified and will have a detrimental impa",
    "The removal of deadwood, dangerous / hanging branches and ivy:  This does not require the formal consent of the Council."
