    "105 Rev I",
    "107 Rev I",
    "and shall thereafter be retained/maintained for as long as the development remains in existence.",
    "REASON",
    "To ensure the development complies with the provisions of the Hillingdon Local Plan Parts 1 (November 2012) and 2 (January 2020) and the London Plan (2021).",
    "Due to the site being within the crane circle for Heathrow Airport the crane operator is required to submit all crane details such as maximum height, operating radius, name, and phone number of site manager along with installation and dismantling dates to the CAA Airspace Coordination and Obstacle Management Service (ACOMS) system.",
    "For notification, please follow the link via CAA website:",
    "Crane notification | Civil Aviation Authority (caa.co.uk)",
    "The development is close to the airport and the landscaping which it includes may attract birds which in turn may create an unacceptable increase in birdstrike hazard. Any such landscaping should, therefore, be carefully designed to minimise its attractiveness to hazardous species of birds. Your attention is drawn to Advice Note 3, 'Potential Bird Hazards: Amenity Landscaping and Building Design' (available at http://www.aoa.org.uk/policy-campaigns/operations-safety/",
    "The decision to GRANT planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2021). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably."
