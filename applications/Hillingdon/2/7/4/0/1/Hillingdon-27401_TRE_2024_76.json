    "The mature Oak tree is in the rear garden of the property. It is visible by multiple gardens and road users for this reason and its age and species, it would be considered of high amenity value. It is lowered in amenity value due to its condition. It has recovered well, but was previously cut too harshly.",
    "The specification will cause the reduction to be back to previous, this will result in a pollard. Previously the tree has been overcut, recovered and sustained growth. If the tree has to repeat this, it may not recover as well or at all. This will cause a decrease in the amenity value of the tree.",
    "The application is rejected due to a lack of arboricultural reasons behind the specification. The tree will lose its amenity value with this specification of work."
