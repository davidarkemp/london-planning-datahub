    "The Oak trees are situated within the rear garden of 13 The Broadwalk and can be seen from the woods to the rear and the PROW R66. The trees have a collective moderate to high amenity value and significantly contribute to the arboricultural character of the Copse Wood Estate an Area of Special Local Character (ASLC). They provide a gradual transition of mature tree cover between the dwellings in the Copse Wood estate and the nearby Ruislip woods National Nature Reserve (NNR). The benefit in amenity and biodiversity afforded by the trees is both present and future because they have the potential for long life expectancies.",
    "Although some trees within the urban environment will require maintenance to them to avoid disruption to services, buildings and reduce risk to those within it, many are in a position where their normal growth and life cycle is entirely concurrent with their situation and to unnecessarily prune these trees would not only harm the amenity they provide to the area, bu",

    "Replacement tree/s: The replacement tree/s will require basic maintenance (watering and weeding during spring and summer) for approximately 2-3 years to encourage successful establishment."
