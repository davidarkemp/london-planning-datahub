    "The development would lead to an unacceptable residential conversion where the internal floor area of the original building to be converted is less than 120 sqm and the proposed conversion would result in the loss of a larger family sized dwellinghouse for which there is an established need in the Borough. The proposal would therefore unacceptably undermine the supply of family housing within the Borough for which there is an identified need, contrary to Policies DMH 1,  DMH 2 and DM4 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy H10 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2023).",
    "The proposed ground floor flats (Flat 1) would fail to provide a satisfactory internal living environment for their future occupiers by virtue of the proximity of the proposed front bedroom windows to the proposed parking/access court and an absence of detail of satisfactory provision of defensible space. Consequently these bedrooms would lack an appropriate degree of privacy and would be subject to noise and disturbance from the comings and goings taking place within the parking/access court, contrary to Policy DMHB 15 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), London Plan (2021) Policy D6 and the National Planning Policy Framework (2023).",
    "The proposed development as a result of the lack of satisfactory separation and inconvenient access would fail to provide private external amenity space of sufficient size and quality for the proposed homes resulting in substandard living conditions for prospective residents contrary to Policy DMHB 18 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2023).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan (2021) and NPPF(2023).",
    "It is noted that elevational details of the outbuilding were not included as part of the application. This did not form a basis of the planning refusal given the recent lawful certificate that was granted for an outbuilding (2708/APP/2023/1832). Were the applicant to appeal the current application a condition would be necessary to ensure the height of the outbuilding would be in line with the previously granted lawful certificate."
