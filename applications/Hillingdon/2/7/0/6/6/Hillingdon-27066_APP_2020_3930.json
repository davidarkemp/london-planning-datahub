    "The proposed conversion of the five-bedroom property at number 16 Swanage Waye into 2 x two-bedroom flats would result in the loss of a residential unit that is suitable for a family. The proposal would therefore unacceptably undermine the supply of family housing within the Borough, contrary to Policies DMH 1, DMH 2 and DMH 4 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy H10 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "In the absence of a sequential assessment, the Local Planning Authority considers that the applicant has failed to provide robust evidence to demonstrate that there are no other sequentially preferable alternative sites for the proposed development besides the application site which partially falls in Flood Zone 2. The proposal, therefore, does not pass the sequential test. The proposal would fail to steer new development away from areas at the highest risk of flooding, contrary to Policy EM6 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies (2012), Policy DMEI 9 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy SI 12 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The proposed development, by virtue of the position of the on-site car parking spaces in such close proximity to the habitable room windows serving the proposed ground floor flat and in the absence of any defensible space, would result in a loss of outlook, loss of privacy, overlooking, noise and disturbance for the future occupiers of this flat. The proposal would therefore result in a substandard form of internal residential accommodation to the detriment of the amenity of the future occupiers of the proposed ground floor flat, contrary to Policies DMHB 15 and DMHB 16 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021)",

The proposal therefore conflicts  with Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012), Policies DMHD1, DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policies D1, D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
