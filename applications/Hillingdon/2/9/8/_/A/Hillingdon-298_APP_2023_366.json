    "The proposed side dormers combined with the two-storey rear and first floor side by reason of the cumulative scale, bulk, massing and design would result in a dominant, bulky, incongruous and visually intrusive form of development that would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original dwelling and the established character and appearance of the street scene. Consequently, the policy would fail to comply with Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012), Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021), Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12, and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and Chapter 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from theÂ  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
