    "The proposed development fails to demonstrate that unacceptable levels of noise, disturbance and odour to surrounding residential occupiers would be appropriately mitigated and that the proposal would not result in an unacceptable concentration of uses. The proposed development would therefore harm the residential amenity of neighbouring occupiers and the general amenities of the area, contrary to Policies DMTC 4, DMHB 11 and DMEI 14 of the Hillingdon Local Plan - Part Two (2020) and Policy D14 of the London plan (2021).",
    "The proposed development due to the design, siting, scale, materials and provision of a second customer entrance at the rear of the site would appear visually incongruous, out of character with the pattern of development, and visually intrusive within the street scene, to the detriment of the appearance of the subject site, the wider shopping parade, the visual amenities of the street scene and the character of the area, contrary to policy D3 of the London Plan (2021), policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and policies DMTC 4, DMHB 11 and DMHB 13 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two (2020).",
    "The proposed development fails to demonstrate that sufficient covered, secured and screened refuse and recycling storage and collection arrangements would be implemented to accommodate the needs of the site and deter fly tipping. The proposed development would therefore harm the residential amenity of neighbouring occupiers and the general amenities of the area, contrary to Policies DMTC 4, DMHB 11 and DMEI 14 of the Hillingdon Local Plan - Part Two (2020) and Policy SI 7 of the London plan (2021).",

Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020."
