    "The proposed dormer windows, by reason of their size, scale, bulk, and design would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original dwelling and would be detrimental to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the street scene, the surrounding area and the setting of the Eastcote (Morford Way) Conservation Area. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 4, DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "The proposal, by reason of the siting of the ground floor flank bedroom window, given its proximity to the side boundary/shed would result in the provision of a habitable room with no outlook or natural lighting and would thus result in a substandard form of living accommodation and reliance upon artificial means of lighting which would fail to satisfy sustainability and energy efficiency objectives and would be to the detriment of the amenity of future occupiers, contrary to Policies 3.5 and 5.3 of the London Plan (March 2016)"
