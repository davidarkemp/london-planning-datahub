    "REASON",
    "To ensure the development complies with the provisions Hillingdon Local Plan Parts 1 (November 2012) and 2 (January 2020) and the London Plan (2021).",
    "i)\tNo advertisement is to be displayed without the permission of the owner of the site or any other person with an interest in the site entitled to grant permission.",
    "ii)\tNo advertisement shall be sited or displayed so as to:-",
    "(a) Endanger persons using any highway, railway, waterway, dock, harbour or aerodrome (civil or military);",
    "(b) Obscure, or hinder the ready interpretation of, any traffic sign, railway signal or aid to navigation by water or air or;",
    "(c ) Hinder the operation of any device used for the purpose of security or surveillance or for measuring the speed of any vehicle.",
    "iii)\tAny advertisement displayed, and any site used for the display of advertisements, shall be maintained in a condition that does not impair the visual amenity of the site.",

    "v)\tWhere an advertisement is required under these Regu",
    "The advertisement(s) hereby permitted shall not be illuminated.",
    "REASON",
    "In order to protect the visual amenity of the area and/or highway safety in accordance with Policy DMHB 13a of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020)  and the NPPF.",
    "The two roof mounted non-illimunated signs (signs 1 and 2 on drawing reference 2023-13CMR-ADS2-4 and 2023-13CMR-ADS2-5 ) shall be removed within two months of the date of this permission.",
    "Reason",
    "The design, appearance and use of materials of the roof mounted signs results in an incongruous and visually intrusive form of development, which fails to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original property and is detrimental to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the street scene.  The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 1, DMHB 2,  DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHB 13 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020)  and the NPPF."
