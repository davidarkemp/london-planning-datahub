    "The proposal, by reason of the size, scale, bulk, design and siting of the rear dormer window, which exceeds the ridge height of the original roof, fails to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original terraced property, detrimental to the character and  appearance of the surrounding area and the visual amenities of the street scene. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",

We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "The applicant is advised that the submitted plans contain discrepancies with regards to the size/height of the dormer."
