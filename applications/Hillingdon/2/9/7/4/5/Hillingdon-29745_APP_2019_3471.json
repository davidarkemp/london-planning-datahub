    "The development hereby permitted shall be begun before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.",

    "To comply with Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990.",
    "The development hereby permitted shall not be carried out except in complete accordance with the details shown on the submitted plans, titled 'Proposed Site' and 'Block plan'. This includes the use of permeable tarmac for the driveway.",
    "REASON",
    "To ensure the development complies with the provisions of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two Saved UDP Policies (November 2012) and the London Plan (2016).",
    "Notwithstanding the details hereby approved a minimum of 25% of the front garden area shall be soft landscaped (eg.grass or planted beds) for so long as the development remains in existence.",
    "REASON",
    "To ensure the proposed development will preserve and enhance the visual amenities of the locality and provide adequate facilities in compliance with Policies BE13, BE38 and AM14 of the Hillingdon Unitary Development Plan Saved Policies September 2007) and Policy 5.17 of the London Plan (2016).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant saved policies (referred to as policies from the Hillingdon Unitary Development Plan - Saved Policies September 2007), then London Plan Policies (2016).  On the 8th November 2012 Hillingdon's Full Council agreed the adoption of the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies. Appendix 5 of this explains which saved policies from the old Unitary Development (which was subject to a direction from Secretary of State in September 2007 agreeing that the policies were 'saved') still apply for development control decisions.",
    "The development requires both the removal and formation of vehicular crossovers, which will be constructed by the Council.  This work is also subject to the issuing of a separate licence to obstruct or open up the public highway.  For further information and advice contact: - Highways Maintenance Operations, 4W/07, Civic Centre, Uxbridge, UB8 1UW.",
    "In addition to works on the property frontage i.e. the removal and relocation of the existing post box, the applicant will need to pay for all works associated with the removal of the lowered kerb and reinstatement of the adjacent footway in Rushdene Road.",
    "It should be noted that the Council will only be able to carry out the above highway works so long as Royal mail do not object to the re-location of the existing post box."
