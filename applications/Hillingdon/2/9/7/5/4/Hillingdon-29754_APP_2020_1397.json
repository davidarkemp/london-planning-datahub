  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed development, by reason of the inadequate plot width and the failure to preserve mature trees including boundary planting, would result in a development of the site which would fail to harmonise with the character of the Gatehill Farm Estate Area of Special Local Character and its original layout. The principle of intensifying the residential use of the site as proposed would have a detrimental impact on the street scene and the character and appearance of the area as a whole.  The proposal is therefore detrimental to the visual amenity and character of the Gatehill Farm Estate Area of Special Local Character and contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012); Policies DMH 6, DMHB 5, DMHB 6 and DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020); Policy 7.4 of the London Plan (2016); and the National Planning Policy Framework.",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan - The Spatial Development Strategy for London consolidated with alterations since 2011 (2016) and national guidance."
