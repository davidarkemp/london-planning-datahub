    "The proposal would fail to appear as a subordinate addition, by virtue of scale, size, massing, bulk and design, incongruous within the character and appearance of the street scene as well as failing to respect the architectural integrity of the host dwelling, contrary to Policies DMHD1, DMHB11 and DMHB12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two (2020) Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012).",
    "The proposed extension, on account of the intensification of the site, would reduce the standard of accommodation to an unacceptable degree to the detriment of the amenities of current and future occupiers of the dwelling due to the level of development on site. The proposal would fail to provide good quality, well located and usable amenity space contrary to Policy DMHD1 and DMHB 18 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two (2020).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
