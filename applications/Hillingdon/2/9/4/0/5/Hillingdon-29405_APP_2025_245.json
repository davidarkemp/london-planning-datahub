    "The proposal would, by its depth, bulk, height, and location, result in a built form which would be harmful to the amenities of the neighbouring occupier at 71 Mulberry Crescent through loss of light and outlook, contrary to Policies D3 and D6 of The London Plan and Policies DMHD 1 and DMHB 11 of Hillingdon Council's Local Plan Part Two Development Management Policies (2020), which seek to protect residential amenity.",
    "The proposed extension's design, scale, and appearance would not appear subordinate and sympathetic to the dwelling and neighbouring properties. The inappropriate extension would be out of keeping with the prevailing development pattern to the detriment of the subject dwelling's appearance, the street scene's visual amenity, and the area's character. The proposal is contrary to Policies D3 and D6 of The London Plan and Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the London Borough of Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the 'Saved' UDP 2007, Local Plan Part 1, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service. This is a resubmission of a previously refused scheme, where the Officers Report identified issues to be addressed, which were reflected in the reasons for refusal, allowing the opportunity to address those issues within this submission."
