  "description": "Erection of a single storey wraparound extension to the side and rear, conversion of roof space to habitable use to include a rear dormer, 2 x front roof lights, conversion of roof from hip to gable end, amendments to fenestration, following the demolition of existing garage.",
  "site_name": "71 PRINCES PARK LANE",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed development by reason of its combined hip to gable extension, large rear dormer and the storey side/rear extension which would breach the return building line would be unduly prominent, visually incongruous and unsympathetic to the original architectural composition of the host dwelling and pair of semis of which it forms part. The proposal would result in a detrimental impact on the character and appearance of the original semi-detached dwelling and would be out of keeping with the character and appearance of the immediate street scene and surrounding area. The proposal thereby fails to comply with Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One- Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), Policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021) and Chapter 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2024).",
    "The proposed extensions would, by virtue of its failure to maintain an adequate amount of private usable external amenity space for the occupiers of the existing property, result in over-development of the site detrimental to the residential amenity of the existing occupiers. The proposal is therefore contrary to policy D6 of The London Plan (2021) and Policies DMHD 1, DMHB 18, and Table 5.3 of Hillingdon Council's Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
