    "The proposed rear extension, by reason of the overall size, scale and bulk, and the resulting disjointed roof form, would represent a form of development that would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original dwelling and would be detrimental to the character, appearance of the host dwelling and wider area. Therefore, the proposed development would be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan (November 2012), Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan - Part Two (2020) and Policies D3 of the London Plan (2021) and Chapter 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The proposed rear extension, by reason of excessive depth, would be considered to have a harmful impact on the amenity of neighbouring occupiers at Number 39 Castleton Road in terms of loss of daylight, sunlight and outlook, contrary to Policies DMHD 1 and DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably."
