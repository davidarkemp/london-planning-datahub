    "The proposal would result in the loss of residential accommodation which would conflict with the requirements of Policy DMH1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020)  which aims to meet the Council's projected Housing Needs.",
    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate that the proposal would provide an adequate quantum of off-street parking space and that those spaces proposed would be functional and capable of safe and independent access. The proposed parking provision is likely to result in roadside parking which would create a more hazardous environment for road users, whilst also causing traffic build up and congestion as vehicles stop to pass parked vehicles. The proposed development is therefore considered to be detrimental to pedestrian and highway safety, as well as the free movement of vehicles on the local highways network. The proposed development is therefore considered to be contrary to Policies DMT 1, DMT 2 and DMT 6 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), as well as policy T6 of the London Plan and the NPPF (2023).",
    "In the absence of a noise report, the applicant has failed to demonstrate that the proposal and the high number of potential occupants, would not result in noise and general disturbance to neighbouring properties alongside a harmful over intensification of the use of the site, detrimental to both the occupiers and neighbouring properties and the character and appearance of the area, all contrary to the requirements of Policies DMHD 1 and DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
