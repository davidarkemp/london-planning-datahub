    "The proposed development, by virtue of its bulk, size, scale and overall massing, would result in alterations to the dwelling that would be visually incongruous, detrimental to the architectural composition of the original property and character and appearance of the street scene. The proposed development would also pose less than substantial harm to the significance of the Ruislip Village Conservation Area without any public benefit to outweigh the harm. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies BE1 and HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2021), Policies DMHB 4, DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management (2020), Policies D3 and HC1 of the London Plan (2021) and Chapters 12 and 16 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service."
