  "description": "Erection of a part single storey, part double storey rear extension. Conversion of roofspace (at first floor level) to habitable use.",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The roof alterations/extensions and first floor rear extension to the dwelling, by reason of the size, scale, bulk, materials and design, would appear as an insubordinate, and visually incongruous form of development that would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original dwelling and would be detrimental to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area.  The proposal, therefore, conflicts, with Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 4, DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local plan - Part Two (2020) and Policy D4 of the London plan (2021).",
    "The  roof alterations/extensions, by reason of its size, height, mass, scale, bulk and proximity, would cause harm to the living conditions of the existing neighbouring occupiers at Littlecotes and their respective private amenity space, in terms of loss of outlook, sense of enclosure and overbearing impact. The proposal would therefore conflict with Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021.",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2021). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. The Council's supports pre-application discussions. We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
