    "Given the lack of supporting information, the proposed use is considered unacceptable in principle, introducing a non-residential use into a predominantly residential area, outside of a designated town centre location, leading to the loss of a family-sized dwelling, without identifying the need. The proposal is therefore considered to conflict with the NPPF (2024), Policies S1, S2, GG1 and GG3 of the London Plan (2021), Policy CI1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Strategic Policies (2012), Policies DMCI 1, DMH 1, DMHB 11, DMT 2, and DMEI 2 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The application fails to satisfactorily and fully demonstrate that the traffic generated by the proposed development would not have an adverse traffic imposition/parking impact on the surrounding highway network thereby potentially leading to adverse congestion/additional on-street parking to the detriment of pedestrian and highway safety contrary to Local Plan: Part 2 Development Management Plan (2020) Policies DMT 1 & DMT 2 and Policy T4 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "The proposed development have an unacceptable and undue impact on existing residential amenity in terms of noise and disturbance and the proposal would therefore be contrary with Policy EM8 of the Hillingdon Local Plan - Part 1: Strategic Policies (2012), Policies DMH5 and DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020) and Policy D14 of the London 2021.",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan (2021) and national guidance."
