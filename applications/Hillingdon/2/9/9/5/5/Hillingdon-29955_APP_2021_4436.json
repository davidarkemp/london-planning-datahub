    "The proposed development by reason of its siting, size, scale, bulk, massing and design would result in a cramped, incongruous and visually prominent form of development. Consequently, the proposed development would be detrimental to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area. The proposal would therefore be contrary Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012), Policies DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two- Development Management Policies (2020), Policies D1, D3, D4 and D8 of the London Plan (2021) and Chapter 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The proposed development, by virtue of its proximity, size, scale, height and design layout would be detrimental to the residential amenities of the neighbouring occupiers at numbers 27 to 30 Black Rod Close and number 2 Dallas Terrace, in terms of loss of light, outlook, overshadowing, overlooking, privacy, sense of enclosure and overbearing effect. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012), Policy DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two- Development Management Policies (2020) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The proposed development, by virtue of its communal amenity space provision and internal floor layout fails to meet the Nationally Described Space Standards and would result in a substandard form of accommodation to the detriment of the amenity of future occupants. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policy DMHB 16 and DMHB 18 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021), the Technical Housing Standards - Nationally Described Space Standard (2015) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The proposal includes an overprovision of car parking, under provision of cycle parking, no electrical charging points and inadequate visibility splays at both of the proposed site entrances (which would reduce pedestrian and vehicle user safety). The proposed development is therefore considered to be contrary to Policies DMT 2 and DMT 6 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), as well as policies T4 and T6 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan (2021).",
    "This is a reminder that Under the terms of the Planning Act 2008 (as amended) and Community Infrastructure Levy Regulations 2010 (as amended), should an application for appeal be allowed, the proposed development would be deemed as 'chargeable development' and therefore liable to pay the London Borough of Hillingdon Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and the Mayor of London's Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This would be calculated in accordance with the London Borough of Hillingdon CIL Charging Schedule 2014 and the Mayor of London's CIL Charging Schedule 2012.",
