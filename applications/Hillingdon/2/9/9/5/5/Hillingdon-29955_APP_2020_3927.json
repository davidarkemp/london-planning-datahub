    "The proposed development by reason of its siting, size, scale, bulk, massing and design would result in a cramped, incongruous and visually prominent form of development. Consequently, the proposed development would be detrimental to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area. The proposal would therefore be contrary Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012), Policies DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two- Development Management Policies (2020), Policies D1, D3, D4 and D8 of the London Plan (2021) and Chapter 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2019).",
    "The proposed development, by virtue of its proximity, size, scale, height and design layout would be detrimental to the residential amenities of the neighbouring occupiers at numbers 27 to 30 Black Rod Close and number 2 Dallas Terrace, in terms of loss of light, outlook, overshadowing, overlooking, privacy, sense of enclosure and overbearing effect. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012), Policy DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two- Development Management Policies (2020) and paragraph 127 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2019).",
    "The proposed development, by virtue of its poor outlook, levels of natural light and failure to meet the Nationally Described Space Standards,  would result in a substandard form of accommodation to the detriment of the amenity of future occupants. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policy DMHB 16 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021), the Technical Housing Standards - Nationally Described Space Standard (2015) and paragraph 127 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2019).",
    "The proposed development by reason of its lack of external amenity space provision would result in a substandard form of accommodation, adversely affecting the amenities of the future occupants. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policies DMHB 11 and DMHB 18 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021) and paragraph 127 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2019).",
    "The proposed development would not provide any three or more bedroom (family sized) units. Robust justification has not been provided to demonstrate that the provision of family sized units would be unsuitable or unviable. The proposal would therefore not provide a suitable mix of housing to support sustainable, inclusive and mixed communities, contrary to Policy DMH 2 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy H10 of the London Plan (2021) and paragraph 61 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2019).",

    "Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020). It has not been demonstrated that the surrounding roads and car park adjoining the site could accommodate the increased demand for street parking spaces generated by the proposed development. The proposal would therefore have an unacceptable adverse impact on highway safety contrary to paragraph 109 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), Policies T6 and T6.1 of the London Plan (2021) and Policies DMT 1, DMT 2 and DMT 6 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The proposed development, by virtue of the proximity between the on-site car parking spaces and the footway to the refuse facilities, would fail to provide safe and secure access for future occupiers and potential result in conflict between pedestrians and vehicles.  The proposal would therefore have an unacceptable adverse impact on highway safety contrary to paragraph 109 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), Policies T6 and T6.1 of the London Plan (2021) and Policies DMT 1, DMT 2 and DMT 6 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The absence of an internal lift to provide adequate access to all users of the development would constitute a substandard form of development, harming the residential amenity of future occupants. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policies DMHB 11 and DMHB 16 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and Policies D5 and D7 of the London Plan (2021).",
