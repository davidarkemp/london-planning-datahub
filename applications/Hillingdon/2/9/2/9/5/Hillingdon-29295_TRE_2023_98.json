    "The Oak tree is situated within the rear garden and can be seen from the highway over and between properties. Alongside other nearby mature trees it provides a gradual transition from dwellings into Ruislip Woods. It has a moderate amenity value and significantly contributes to the arboreal character of the local area.",
    "Previous approvals have been for crown thinning only, as a result this Oak has not been reduced in the past creating a naturally shaped open canopy. A crown reduction by as much as 2-3m would drastically reduce the canopy size and therefore its amenity value.",
    "Having regard to the reasons given for the proposed work, the work is unjustified and will have a detrimental impact on the visual amenity and arboreal character of the area.",
    "The removal of deadwood, dangerous / hanging branches and ivy:  This does not require the formal consent of the Council."
