    "The proposal would provide bedrooms of a substandard floor area and width giving rise to a substandard form of living accommodation to the detriment of the amenity of future occupiers. The proposal is thus contrary to Policies DMHB 11 and DMHB 16 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), Policy 3.5 and Table 3.3 of the London Plan (2016), the Housing Standards Minor Alterations to The London Plan (March 2016), the Mayor of London's adopted Supplementary Planning Guidance - Housing (March 2016) and the Technical Housing Standards - Nationally Described Space Standard (March 2015).",
    "The proposed first floor side extension, by reason of its siting, size, scale, excessive width and design, would fail to appear as a subordinate addition and would thus fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original semi-detached dwelling, would be detrimental to the character, appearance and symmetry of the pair of semi-detached houses of which it forms a part and to the visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the 'Saved' UDP 2007, Local Plan Part 1, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
