    "The proposed three storey side extension, by virtue of its misaligned eaves height, fenestration treatment and external finishes, together with the excessive size of the side elevation windows, would result in a disjointed and incongruous form of development that would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original dwelling, and would be detrimental to the appearance of the original host dwelling, and cause harm to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the existing street scene and setting of the Gatehill Farm Estate, Northwood, Area of Special Local Character. The proposed development is therefore contrary to Policies HE1 and BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012), Policies DMHB 5, DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and Policies HC1 and D3 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The proposed single storey side/rear extension, by virtue of its position, height and design, would result in an unduly prominent and visually incongruous form of development  that would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original dwelling, and would be detrimental to the appearance of the original host dwelling, and cause harm to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the existing street scene and setting of the Gatehill Farm Estate, Northwood, Area of Special Local Character.

    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal.",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2021). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020."
