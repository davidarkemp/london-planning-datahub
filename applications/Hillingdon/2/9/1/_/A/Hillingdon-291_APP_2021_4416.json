    "By virtue of its size, scale, footprint, and prominent location, the proposed extension would result in an incongruous form of development that would be detrimental to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area. The proposal would therefore conflict with Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012) and Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "By virtue of its depth, proximity, siting, size, scale and massing, the proposed extension would cause harm to the living conditions of the existing neighbouring occupiers at number 14 Hitherbroom Road and their respective private amenity space, in terms of loss of outlook, overshadowing, privacy, sense of enclosure and overbearing impact. The proposal would therefore conflict with Policy DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
