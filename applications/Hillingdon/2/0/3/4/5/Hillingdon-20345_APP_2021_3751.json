    "The proposed front extension by reason of its cumulative size, scale, bulk, width and design, would represent an unduly incongruous form of development which would be detrimental to the architectural composition of the existing building and would be detrimental to the visual amenities of the street scene and the wider area. The proposed development is therefore contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the  Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and policies D4 and D8 of the London Plan (2021).",

We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
