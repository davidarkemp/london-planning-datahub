    "The proposed outbuilding, by reason of its excessive footprint, bulk, mass, height, and stated use would fail to be for a purpose incidental to the enjoyment of the host dwelling house, or be proportionate to the footprint of the host dwelling. Furthermore, the proposed outbuilding would represent a discordant and harmful addition to the character of the surrounding area. The proposal is therefore considered contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHD2 and DMHB11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan - Part Two (2020), The London Plan (2021), and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "In the absence of an Arboricultural Impact Assessment, Method Statement and Tree Protection Plan, the application has failed to demonstrate that the proposed outbuilding could be constructed without undue harm to the trees protected by Tree Preservation Order number 299, where the site is located. The potential harm caused to the protected trees would undermine the character and visual amenity of the area. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One Strategic Policies (2012) and Policy DMHB 11 and DMHB 14 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2: Development Management Policies (2020) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021)."
