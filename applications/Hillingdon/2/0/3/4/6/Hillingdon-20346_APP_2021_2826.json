    "Due to its excessive size, scale, bulk and width, the proposed rear dormer would form an oversized addition to the roof of the dwelling harming its architectural composition and appearance. The visual harm caused by the dormer would be worsened by its poor relationship with the roof of the original dwelling and roof of the proposed two storey rear extension. The proposed development is therefore considered to be significantly harmful to the appearance of host dwelling and contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "The proposed part single, part two storey rear extension, by virtue of its size, design and proximity, would be detrimental to the amenities of the adjoining occupiers at 5 and 7 Lawrence Drive, by reason of visual intrusion, loss of privacy and overlooking. Therefore, the proposal would be contrary to Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and paragraph 130(f) of the NPPF(2021)."
