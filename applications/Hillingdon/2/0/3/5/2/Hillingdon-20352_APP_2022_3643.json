    "The proposed rear dormers, by virtue of its proximity and openings, would be detrimental to the amenities of the adjoining occupiers at No.59 Orchard Road by reason of visual intrusion, overlooking and loss of privacy. Therefore, the proposal would be contrary to policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The proposed rear dormer, by reason of its visually prominent corner position, size, scale, bulk and design would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the end-terrace dwelling, would be detrimental to the character, appearance and symmetry of the small terrace of houses of which it forms a part and would fail to either preserve or enhance the character or appearance of the surrounding Central Avenue, Hayes, Area of Special Local Character. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies BE1 and HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 1, DMHB 5, DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020)."
