    "The proposed first floor rear extensions, in combination with the existing roof alterations and extensions, and other existing rear and side alterations by reason of the size, scale, bulk, and design would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original dwellings and result in a visually intrusive overdevelopment of both sites. This would be harmful to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the street scene, and the surrounding Area of Special Local Character. This would be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 5, DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), Policies D3 and HC1 of the London Plan (2021) and Chapters 12 and 16 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023).",
