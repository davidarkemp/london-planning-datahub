    "The additional windows proposed within this application would not be considered Permitted Development as it would be in breach of planning condition within application reference 20315/APP/2024/1119 which restricts additional windows or doors within the approved side extension. It is also noted that as the side and rear extensions approved under application reference 20315/APP/2024/1119 are not substantially complete, and therefore this Certificate of Lawfulness application includes works within the proposed drawing that would not be considered to be Permitted Development. The proposed development therefore does not comply with the legislation and conditions set out in Article 3, Schedule 2, Part 1, Class A of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended)."
