    "By reason of its boxy, overwhelming and top heavy design, its excessive size, scale, mass and bulk and its location on the front roof plane, the proposed dormer would fail to respect the architectural integrity of the host building, disrupt the rhythm of the existing roof and harm the character and appearance of the wider area, contrary to Policies DMHD1, DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two (2020).",
    "By reason of it being obscure glazed (and the additional need for it to be fixed shut by condition), the proposed bedroom in the roof would result in a habitable area with no outlook and minimal light and ventilation, resulting in substandard living accomodation harmful to current and future occupiers of No 38 Derby Road, contrary to Policy D6 of the London Plan 2021, Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan (Part 1) 2012 and Policy DMH 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan (Part 2) 2012",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service. We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
