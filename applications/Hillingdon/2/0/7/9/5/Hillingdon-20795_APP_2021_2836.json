    "The proposed first floor rear extension, by reason of its size, scale, bulk, full width massing alongside the use of white render would result in an excessive, bulky, dominant, visually intrusive, top heavy, visually intrusive and jarring addition that would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original dwelling, would be detrimental to the character and appearance of the context of which it forms a part and to the visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012) and Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The proposed first floor rear extension, by reason of the siting, size, scale, bulk and proximity would be detrimental to the amenities of the adjacent occupier at 141 Bury Street by reason of overdominance, loss of outlook, sense of enclosure, visual intrusion, loss of daylight/sunlight and overbearing impact. Therefore, the proposal would be contrary to Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2016). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020."
