    "The proposed extensions by reason of their position, size, scale, bulk, design and massing would result in overly dominant and incongruous additions, detrimental to the architectural composition, form, character and appearance of the original property and the visual amenities of the streetscene and Area of Special Local Character, contrary to Policies BE1 and HE1 of The Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), and Policies DMHD 1, DMHB 1, DMHB 5 and DMHB 11 of The Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan (2021) and national guidance.",

We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "The Council has offered the applicant the opportunity to submit amended drawings, however the amendments have not overcome the concerns with the proposal."
