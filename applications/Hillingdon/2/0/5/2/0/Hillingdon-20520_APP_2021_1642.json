    "The proposed outbuilding, by reason of its size, scale and bulk would not appear nor function as a subservient addition to the main dwelling and would have a harmful impact on the character and appearance of the host dwelling and the surrounding North Uxbridge Area of Special Local Character. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies BE1 and HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 1, DMHB 5, DMHB 11 and DMHD 2 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), Policy HC1 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2019).",
    "The proposal fails to provide sufficient detail in terms of the internal layout of the outbuilding and its intended use to allow the Local Planning Authority to fully consider the impacts of the proposal and whether the proposed outbuilding would be capable of independent occupation and therefore tantamount to a separate dwelling in a position where such a dwelling would not be acceptable as it could result in unacceptable impacts on the surrounding North Uxbridge Area of Special Local Character, adjoining occupiers and additional requirements for parking and amenity space. The proposal is therefore contrary to policies DMHB 5, DMHB 11, DMHB 18, DMT 6 and DMHD 2 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and Policies D6 and T6.1 of the London Plan (March 2021).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service."
