  "description": "Erection of a two storey, 3 bed dwelling with associated amenity space, refuse storage and parking provision",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed development, by reason of its siting, layout, and site coverage, would result in a cramped development of the site, which is visually incongruous (given the setting) and would fail to harmonise with the existing local and historic context of the surrounding area. The proposal would thus, have a detrimental impact on the character, appearance and local distinctiveness of The Greenway  Conservation Area. The proposal would, therefore, fail to either preserve or enhance the character or appearance of the surrounding Greenway Conservation Area. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies BE1 and HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 1, DMHB 4, DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), Policy 7.8 of the London Plan (2016) and the NPPF.",
    "The proposal, by reason of the siting of the rear windows/doors which serve the lounge/kitchen and their proximity to the boundary treatment, would result in an oppressive environment and the provision of habitable rooms with very poor outlook that would result in a substandard form of living accommodation which would be to the detriment of the amenity of future occupiers, contrary to Policy DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policies 3.5 and 5.3 of the London Plan (2016) and the Mayor of London's adopted Supplementary Planning Guidance - Housing (March 2016) .",
    "The proposal, by reason of the loss of car parking for the existing public house, has not demonstrated that sufficient off street parking arrangements would be provided for the existing public house and that the development would not result in on-street parking/queuing to the detriment of public and highway safety. The proposal is thus contrary to policies DMT 1, DMT 2 and DMT 6 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020) and to Hillingdon's Adopted Parking Standards as set out in Appendix C of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "The proposed development, by virtue of its failure to provide amenity space of sufficient size and quality commensurate to the size and layout of the said unit would result in an over-development of the site detrimental to the residential amenity of future occupiers. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies DMHB 11 and DMHB 18 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "The proposed extension to the existing crossover, by reason of its excessive width would be detrimental to highway and pedestrian safety. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies DMT 1 and DMT 2 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020)",
    "In the absence of a noise assessment to demonstrate adequate mitigation of noise emanating from the garden of the public house the proposed development is considered to result in significant impacts to the living conditions of future occupiers, by reason of noise and disturbance.  The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan : Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and Policies D13 and D14 of the Draft London Plan (intended to publish version).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2016). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020.",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan - The Spatial Development Strategy for London consolidated with alterations since 2011 (2016) and national guidance.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.  Some negotiation took place and the applicant was given an opportunity to amend the proposals.  However, the Council has  been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
