  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed introduction of additional glazed openings, the increase in the size of the porch and the introduction and an entirely new form of development by way of the solar panels would materially alter the appearance of the property when viewed from the street scene and may have an impact upon nearby residents as such separate permission is required. Furthermore condition 10 of application ref:20162/APP/2017/2755 states that no additional windows or doors shall be introduced without prior consent from the LPA. The proposal in this case cannot be considered as non-material as it represents a form of development beyond the scope of the planning approval."
