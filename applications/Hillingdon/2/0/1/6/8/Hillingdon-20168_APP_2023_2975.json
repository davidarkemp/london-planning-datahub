    "The proposed flat (unit 2) would have no private outdoor amenity space. The occupiers of the new dwelling would therefore be subjected to a poor standard of living accommodation to the detriment of their amenities. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policy DMHB 18 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and paragraph 135 (f) of the NPPF (2023).",
    "The conversion of the three-bedroom dwelling into 2 x 2 bedroom flats would result in the loss of a residential unit that is suitable and appropriately sized for a family. The proposal would therefore unacceptably undermine the supply of family housing within the Borough for which there is an identified need, contrary to Policies DMH 1 and DMH 2 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy H10 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2023).",
