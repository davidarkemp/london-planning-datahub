    "The oak tree is located in the front garden of 31 Copse Wood Way, Northwood. It predates the housing development on Copse Wood Way, and would have originally been a part of Ruislip Woods. The mature tree appears to be in good condition and health, is in a prominent position along the road and greatly contributes to the arboreal character of the area.",
    "This application has been refused due to the lack of supporting technical evidence. Although the tree is within the potential zone of influence, the root analysis provided could not confirm Oak roots present.",
    "Having regard to the reasons given for the proposed work, the work is unjustified and will have a detrimental impact on the visual amenity and arboreal character of the area.",
    "The removal of deadwood, dangerous / hanging branches and ivy:  This does not require the formal consent of the Council.",
    "Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981:  Note that it is an offence under this act to disturb roosting bats, nesting birds or any other protected species.  Therefore, if applicable, it is advisable to consult your tree surgeon / consultant to agree an acceptable time for carrying out the approved works."
