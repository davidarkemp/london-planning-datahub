    "The Oak tree is situated in the front garden of 31 Copse Wood Way and can be seen along the road, The tree does not appear to have been pruned before and has an attractive, natural-looking crown typical of it's species. Along with other nearby trees the Oak helps to provide a gradual transition of mature tree cover between the dwellings in Copsewood Way and the nearby Ruislip woods National Nature Reserve (NNR).",
    "The tree contributes to local biodiversity, and significantly contributes to the amenity and arboreal / wooded character of the Copsewood Estate Area of Special Local Character. The tree has a very high amenity value.",
    "The tree appears to be in good health and pruning it would unnecessarily introduce multiple wounds into its crown, which would likely cause stress and lead to infection, affecting its long-term health; this would affect the safe useful life expectancy of the tree. Pruning would also result in weakly attached re-growth forming that would be prone to future failure",
    "The removal of deadwood, dangerous / hanging branches and ivy:  This does not require the formal consent of the Council."
