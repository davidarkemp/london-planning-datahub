    "The proposed development, by virtue of the poor overall layout of Flat A including the reliance of side facing habitable windows (serving bedroom 2 and 3), there would be a harmful effect upon the living conditions of the future occupants of Flat A in terms of loss of privacy, overlooking issues, poor outlook, noise and disturbance. Therefore, it would result in an unsatisfactory quality of internal residential accommodation for the future occupants of the Flat A.  The proposal would therefore result in a substandard form of internal residential accommodation to the detriment of the amenity of the future occupiers of the proposed development, contrary to Policy DMHB 16 of the  Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2023).",
