    "The proposed development, by virtue of the poor overall layout of Flat A including the reliance of side facing window (serving bedroom 2)given its proximity to the side boundary together with the elongated communal living space would lead to substandard outlook and in  the absence of a BRE daylight and sunlight assessment, the application has failed to demonstrate that the proposed development would have adequate levels of sunlight and daylight. Therefore, it would result in an unsatisfactory quality of internal residential accommodation for the future occupants of the Flat A.  The proposal would therefore result in a substandard form of internal residential accommodation to the detriment of the amenity of the future occupiers of the proposed development, contrary to Policy DMHB 16 of the  Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2023).",
    "The proposed development, by virtue of the proximity of the on-site car parking space in relation to the front habitable windows, would cause unacceptable noise, disturbance, overlooking and loss of privacy for the future occupants of Flat A. The proposal would therefore result in a substandard form of internal residential accommodation to the detriment of the amenity of the future occupiers of the proposed development, contrary to Policies DMHB 15 and DMHB 16 of the  Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2023).",
    "The proposed development, by virtue of its failure to provide private amenity space provision that is of a sufficient size and quality would be detrimental to the external  living conditions of future occupiers of the proposed Flat B. The proposal would therefore conflict with Policy DMHB 18 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2023).",
    "The proposed development, due to the proximity of the primary amenity for Flat B with habitable windows of No.8 Rickmansworth would have an overbearing impact on the adjoining residents leading to a harmful increase of disturbance and noise. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012), Policy DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2023).",
