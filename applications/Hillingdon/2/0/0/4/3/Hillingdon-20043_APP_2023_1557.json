    "The proposal by reason of its, scale, bulk and design would represent an incongruous form of development which would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original dwelling and would be detrimental to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the surrounding area. Therefore, the proposed development would be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan (November 2012), Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan - Part Two (2020) and Policies D3 of the London Plan (2021) and Chapter 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The proposal would result in a habitable room (study) with limited and/or no natural lighting and reduced outlook that would result in a substandard form of living accommodation which would fail to satisfy sustainability and energy efficiency objectives and would be to the detriment of the amenity of future occupiers, contrary to Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and Policies D6 and SI2 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
