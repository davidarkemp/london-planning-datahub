    "The proposed rear extension, by virtue of its scale, depth and size would represent a disproportionate addition to the host property which fails to respond the specific site context and the established rear building line of near neighbours, resulting in harm to the character and appearance of the host property as well as the character and appearance of the wider area and streetscene of Francis Road, all contrary to policies in the development plan including policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One Strategic Policies (2012) and DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The proposed rear extension, by virtue of its size, scale, bulk, height, depth and proximity, would be detrimental to the amenities of the adjoining occupier at 38 Barnhill, by reason of overdominance, overshadowing, visual intrusion, loss of light and loss of outlook. Therefore, the proposal would be contrary to policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020)."
