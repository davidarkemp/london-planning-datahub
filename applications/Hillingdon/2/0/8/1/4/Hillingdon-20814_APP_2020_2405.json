  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed extensions, by reason of their size, scale, bulk, depth and proximity, would be detrimental to the amenities of the adjoining occupier at 547 and 551 Bath Road, by reason of overdominance, overshadowing, visual intrusion, loss of light and loss of outlook. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies.",
    "The proposed extensions, by reason of their excessive size, scale, bulk, cumulative width, height, depth and design, would fail to appear as subordinate additions and would thus fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original and adjoining dwellings. The proposal would therefore represent an overdevelopment of the site to the detriment of the character and appearance and visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area, contrary to Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2016). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020."
