    "The development hereby permitted shall be begun before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.",

    "To comply with Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990.",
    "The development hereby permitted shall not be carried out except in complete accordance with the details shown on the submitted plans, numbers: AP(0-)031, AP(0-)032, AP(0-)033 and shall thereafter be retained/maintained for as long as the development remains in existence.",
    "REASON",
    "To ensure the development complies with the provisions Hillingdon Local Plan Part:One (November 2012) and Local Plan: Part Two (2020) and the London Plan (2016).",
    "Prior to the relevant part of the works, an external lighting scheme shall be submitted and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority. Details shall include measures to ensure that external lights are automatically turned off when the buildings are not in use. The development shall thereafter be completed in accordance with the approved scheme and shall remain in place for the lifetime of the development.",
    "REASON",
    "To safeguard residential amenity in accordance with policies  DMHB 1, DMHB 4 and DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and to reduce energy demands in accordance with Policy 5.2 of the London Plan (2016).",
    "The decision to GRANT planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to GRANT planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Unitary Development Plan set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan (2016) and national guidance.",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant saved policies (referred to as policies from the Hillingdon Unitary Development Plan - Saved Policies September 2007), then London Plan Policies (2016).  On the 8th November 2012 Hillingdon's Full Council agreed the adoption of the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies. Appendix 5 of this explains which saved policies from the old Unitary Development (which was subject to a direction from Secretary of State in September 2007 agreeing that the policies were 'saved') still apply for development control decisions."
