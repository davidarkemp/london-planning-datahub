    "The proposed development, in particular the two proposed side dormers, by reason of its size, scale, bulk, height, and design, would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original dwelling and would be detrimental to the character, appearance, and visual amenities of the street scene. It is considered to result in less than substantial harm to the Ruislip Village Conservation Area without sufficient public benefit to outweigh the harm. Therefore, the proposal would be contrary to Policy BE1 and HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012), Policies DMHB 4, DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policies D3 and HC1 of the London Plan (2021), and Chapters 12 and 16 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service."
