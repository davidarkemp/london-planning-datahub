    "The proposed development, by reason of its excessive size, scale, bulk, height, and design of the dormer windows, would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original dwelling and would be detrimental to the character, appearance, and visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area. Furthermore, the side extension, by reason of its size, scale, bulk, design and siting, would result in an incongruous and cramped appearance, eroding the prevailing gap between dwellinghouses and harming the character and appearance of the original dwellinghouse and streetscene. Therefore, the proposal would be contrary to Policy D3 of The London Plan (2021), Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies.",
    "The proposed development, by reason of the side-facing dormer window and its proximity to the neighbouring property, 21 Nicholls Avenue, would result in a form of development which would not provide satisfactory amenities for that adjoining property due to the loss of privacy that could arise. The proposal is, therefore, contrary to Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021) and Policies DMHB11 and DMHD1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan - Part Two (2020).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
