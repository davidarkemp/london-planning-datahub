The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012),and Policy DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies with Modifications (March 2019).",

    "The proposed development, by virtue of the position of the side facing window, would be detrimental to the amenities of the adjoining occupier at Hascombe by reason of overlooking and loss of privacy. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policy DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies with Modifications (March 2019).",
    "The proposed single storey rear extension, by virtue of its size, scale and depth would be detrimental to the amenities of the adjoining occupier at Wynnstay, by reason of overdominance, overshadowing, visual intrusion, loss of light and loss of outlook. Therefore, the proposal would be contrary to Policy DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies with Modifications (March 2019).",
