    "Approved - To reduce one Ash (T212 on TPO 7) by 4m height and upto 4m spread. Remove deadwood.",
    "The Ash tree to be pruned shall be crown reduced as per the approved specification / by a maximum of 4m in height and spread. This work shall comprise a reduction in both height and spread over the whole crown by shortening or removing peripheral branches in a uniform and systematic manner.  Where branches are shortened, they should be cut back to a suitably positioned secondary branch.",
    "Crown reduction shall not be construed as 'lopping' or 'topping' and shall result in a tree of typical form for the species and of balanced appearance. The works shall be carried out in accordance with the recommendations contained in BS 3998:2010 'Tree work - Recommendations'. Climbing irons or 'spikes' shall not be used during the execution of the work.",
    "REASON",
    "In order to protect health of the tree and the visual amenity of the area.",
    "Crown reduction and/or crown reshaping:  Involves the overall reduction of the height and spread of a tree's crown, whilst, as far as possible, retaining its natural shape. It is advisable to retain smaller branches close to the pruning wounds to aid in the drawing up of water to the wounded tissue.",
    "Timing of works:  Pruning works should not be carried out during the period of bud burst and care should be taken to ensure that branches are cut back to healthy outward facing buds to avoid die-back to which some species are prone. For major works, such as pollarding or copping, work should only be carried out after the autumn leaf fall when the sap has gone down, and certainly well before the sap rises in the spring before bud burst has taken place.",
    "Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981:  Note that it is an offence under this act to disturb roosting bats, nesting birds or any other protected species.  Therefore, if applicable, it is advisable to consult your tree surgeon / consultant to agree an acceptable time for carrying out the approved works.",
    "Expected standard of tree work: The approved works must be carried out in accordance with the conditions laid out above. If they are not, then enforcement action could being taken which could lead to prosecution and heavy fines. Therefore, it is highly recommended that the works are only carried out by a professional and competent arboriculturist who undertakes to comply with the conditions of this consent and in accordance with industry best practice (BS 3998:2010). The Arboricultural Association can provide details of its approved contractors, who have demonstrated such professionalism and competence, on their website (www.trees.org.uk) or by calling 01242 522152. Or on request the Council can provide a list of contractors who are known to carry out tree work to a good standard and to normally maintain an appropriate policy of indemnity insurance.",
    "Refused  -  To fell one False Acacia and one Box Elder within G71 on TPO 7.",
    "The mature Box Elder tree and False Acacia trees are collectively considered to have a moderate amenity value and make a good contribution to the visual amenity and arboreal character of the local area.",
    "With regard to the proposed removal of the mature False Acacia and Box Elder trees (within G71) which are located next to the garage - these works are not viewed as being necessary and the reasons given for their removal are not justified. It is alleged that the Box Elder tree is causing damage to the garage, however, no technical evidence has been provided which supports this. Both of these trees together form a valuable screen which helps to improve the visual amenity of the local area.",
    "Conclusion: Having regard to the reasons given for removing these two trees, the works are considered to be unnecessary, unjustified and will have a detrimental impact on the visual amenity and arboreal character of the local area.",
    "The removal of deadwood, dangerous / hanging branches and ivy:  This does not require the formal consent of the Council.",
    "Refusal of part of the requested works: The applicant retains a right of appeal against the part of the application that has effectively been refused (To fell one False Acacia and one Box Elder within G71 on TPO 7)."
