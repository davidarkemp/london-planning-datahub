    "The proposed development by reason of its size, scale, mass, bulk, depth and design would result in an overly dominant, cramped and excessive form of development, which would engulf the original property and fail to respect its architectural integrity, all detrimental to the character and appearance of streetscene and surrounding area. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies.",
    "The proposed part two storey, part single storey side extension, by virtue of its size, scale, bulk and proximity, would be detrimental to the amenities of the adjoining occupier at 13 Owen Road, which has a first floor side facing window serving a habitable room, by reason of overdominance, overshadowing, visual intrusion, loss of light and loss of outlook. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies."
