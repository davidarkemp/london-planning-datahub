  "description": "Part two storey, part single storey side extension and single storey side extension",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed part two storey, part single storey side extension, by virtue of its siting, size, scale and design, including the lack of a set back from the front at all levels, in combination with existing extensions, would result in an incongruous addition which would engulf and be detrimental to the appearance of the original and adjoining properties, the visual amenities of the street scene and the character and appearance of the wider area. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "The proposed part two storey, part single storey side extension, by virtue of its size, scale, bulk and proximity, would be detrimental to the amenities of the adjoining occupier at 14 Owen Road, which has a first floor side facing window serving a habitable room, by reason of overdominance, overshadowing, visual intrusion, loss of light and loss of outlook. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies.",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2016). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. The Council's supports pre-application discussions.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
