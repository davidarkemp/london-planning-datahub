    "The development would lead to the unacceptable subdivision and loss of a small single family dwelling for which there is an established need in the Borough. The development would therefore be contrary to policy DMH 4 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "The proposal has not demonstrated that amenity space of sufficient size and quality commensurate to the size and layout of the said units be provided and therefore the proposal would result in an over-development of the site detrimental to the residential amenity of future occupiers. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies DMH 4, DMHB 11 and DMHB 18 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), Policy D6 of the London Plan and the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF).",
    "The proposal has not demonstrated that sufficient off street parking/manoeuvring arrangements would be provided, and therefore the development is considered to result in substandard car parking provision, leading to on-street parking/queuing to the detriment of public and highway safety and contrary to policies DMT 2 and DMT 6 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020) and to Hillingdon's Adopted Parking Standards as set out in Appendix C of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "The proposed development would constitute an over development of the site resulting in visual clutter within the streetscene and the subdivision of the plot that would fail to be in keeping with the prevailing character and pattern of development in the area. The development would therefore be harm to the character and appearance of the existing site, the streetscene and the wider area. As such the development is contrary to Policies DMH 4, DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), the London Plan and the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan (2021) and national guidance."
