    "The proposed single-storey rear extension by reason of its design, cumulative scale, and massing, would have a harmful impact on the character and appearance of the host dwelling, constituting an incongruous addition to the detriment of the visual amenity and character of the semi-detached formation and the surrounding residential area. The proposal is, therefore, contrary to Policy D4 of the London Plan (2021), Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan (Part 1) (2012) and Policies DMHD 1 and DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan (Part 2) (2020).",
    "The proposed extension would provide an excessively deep (12.5 metres) habitable room (dining room/family room/kitchen), which relies on a single-aspect outlook. The development would result in a habitable room with a very restricted outlook and poor levels of natural/sunlight and would, therefore, give rise to a substandard form of living accommodation to the detriment of the amenity of future occupiers. The proposal is thus contrary to Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021) and Policy DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan - Part 2: Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service."
