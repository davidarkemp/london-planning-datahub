As a result, it has an attractive natural looking crown typical of its species. The tree appears to be in good health and pruning it would unnecessarily introduce multiple wounds into its crown, which would likely cause stress and lead to infection, affecting its long-term health; this would affect the safe useful life expectancy of the tree. Pruning would also result in weakly attached re-growth forming that would be prone to future failure.",
