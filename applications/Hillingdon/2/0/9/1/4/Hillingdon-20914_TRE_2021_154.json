    "21 Mount Pleasant, Ruislip back onto the grounds of Field End Junior School, the Oak can also be seen from the road between/ above the properties. As a result, it has a high amenity value and it significantly contribution to the arboreal character and amenity of the area.",
    "The Oak does not appear to have received prior work, as a result, it has an attractive natural looking crown typical of its species. The tree appears to be in good health and pruning it would unnecessarily introduce multiple wounds into its crown, which would likely cause stress and lead to infection, affecting its long-term health; this would affect the safe useful life expectancy of the tree. Pruning would also result in weakly attached re-growth forming that would be prone to future failure.",
    "Having regard to the reasons given for the proposed work, the work is unjustified and will have a detrimental impact on the visual amenity and arboreal character of the area.",
