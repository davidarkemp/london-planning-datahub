    "The proposed two storey rear extension by reason of its bulk, mass, depth, scale, resultant roof form and overall height, would fail to read as a subordinate addition to the house and would fail to respect its architectural integrity, representing a harmful addition to the character of the local area, harming the streetscene of Tudor Way, all contrary to Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service."
