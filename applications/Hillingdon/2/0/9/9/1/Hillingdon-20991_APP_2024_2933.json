    "The conversion of the existing 1 no. four-bedroom dwelling into 2  no. two bedroom dwellings would result in the loss of a residential unit that is suitable and appropriately sized for a family. The proposal would therefore unacceptably undermine the supply of family housing within the Borough for which there is an identified need, contrary to Policies DMH 1 and DMH 2 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy H10 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2024).",
    "The proposed new dwelling with primary access from Kingswear Road would benefit from no front garden as access would be directly from the public footpath and in addition the resulting dwelling would also benefit from a substandard level of private outdoor amenity space to the rear (40 sqm), below the recommended standards for a two bedroom dwelling.  As such, the future occupiers of the dwellings would be subjected to a poor standard of living accommodation to the detriment of their amenities. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policy DMHB 18 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and paragraph 135 (f) of the National Planning Policy Framework (2024).",
    "Character and Appearance: The proposed extensions to the dwelling by reason for additional size, scale and bulk, in addition to the existing extensions to the side and rear, would result in a form of development that would fail to read as subordinate to the original dwelling. The proposed side extension, which would include new access to the proposed new dwelling, would appear as awkward form of development which would result in harm to the character and appearance of the existing terrace and wider street scene along Seaton Gardens and Kingswear Road.",
    "Whilst not standalone reason for refusal, the harm posed in respect of Principle of Development (Reason for Refusal 1) and External Amenity (Reason for Refusal 2) and harm to character and appearance accumulate to weigh against the scheme in the planning balance. Section 38(6) of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004 states that planning applications should be determined in accordance with the development plan unless material co",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan (2021)  and national guidance.",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2021). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
