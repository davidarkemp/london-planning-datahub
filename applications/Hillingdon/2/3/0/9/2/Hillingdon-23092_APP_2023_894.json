    "The proposed single storey side/rear extension, by reason of the prominent siting,  depth, bulk and massing would result in a dominant, excessive, bulky and unsympathetic and disproportionate addition that would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original dwelling, would be detrimental to the character and appearance of the context of which it forms a part and to the visual amenities of the prominent siting location adjacent to a public right of way, street scene and the surrounding area. Therefore, the proposal would be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012) and Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The proposed side/rear extension, by virtue of its combined scale, depth and bulk, given its siting in close proximity to the boundary shared with Number 545 Bath Road, would result in an unacceptably oppressive and overbearing form of development resulting in a harmful sense of enclosure and loss of outlook, in direct conflict with policies DMHB11 and DMHD1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan - 2020.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "In order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably. In addition further guidance was offered to the applicant by the case officer during the processing of the application to identify the amendments to address those elements of the scheme considered unacceptable which the applicant chose not to implement."
