    "The development, by reason of its overall design, scale, bulk of the revised roof form, in particular the two storey gabled front extensions would result in an excessive, incongruous, dominant and visually intrusive form of development that would harm the character, appearance and visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012), Policy DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021) and Paragraphs 139 and 140 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023).",
