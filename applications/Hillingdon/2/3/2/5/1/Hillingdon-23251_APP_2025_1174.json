    "The development, by virtue of the loss of the existing family dwelling, would conflict with the Borough's strategic housing goal of safeguarding  family dwellings and the proposed change of use to a Large HMO would be harmful to the character of the area. Consequently, the principle of development is considered to be unacceptable. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies DMH 1, DMH 5, DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020);  Policies H8 (A) and H9 of the London Plan 2021; and the National Planning Policy Framework (2024).",
    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate that the proposal and the high number of potential occupants, would not result in noise and general disturbance to neighbouring properties which alongside a harmful over intensification of the use of the site would be detrimental to both the occupiers and neighbouring properties and the residential amenity of the area. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies DMH 5, DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policies D3 and D13 of the London Plan (2021) and  the National Planning Policy Framework (2024).",
    "Due to its siting, massing and flat roofed design, the proposed two storey rear extension would result in an uncharacteristic and visually incongruous form of development which would fail to harmonise with the architectural integrity of the host building and the established character of the area and appearance of the street scene. The proposal would therefore be detrimental to the visual amenities of the streetscene and the character and appearance of the surrounding area, all contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012), Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12, DMHB 14 and DMHD1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policies D1 and D3 of the London Plan (2021) and the NPPF (2024).",
    "The applicant has failed to satisfactorily demonstrate that the proposal would provide an adequate quantum of off-street parking spaces, or secure cycle storage in accordance with car parking standards. In the absence of a Section 106 agreement or Unilateral Undertaking to remove residents access to obtain parking permits within the surrounding streets it cannot be demonstrated that the development would not place undue pressure on parking within the surrounding streets of detriment to highway safety and amenity. The proposed development is therefore considered to be contrary to Policies DMT 1, DMT 2 and DMT 6 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), as well as Policy T6 and T5 of the London Plan (2021) and  the NPPF (2024).",
    "The proposed development has failed to demonstrate that it would provide an adequate level of outlook for the future occupiers of bedrooms 10 and 11  due to their reliance solely on rooflights, which are set at high level. The proposal would therefore give rise to a substandard form of living accommodation to the detriment of the amenities of future occupiers contrary to Policy DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies and Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021)",
    "In the absence of a robust Tree Survey and Arboricultural Impact Assessment, the applicant has failed to demonstrate that the development would safeguard existing trees on the site and further fails to demonstrate protection for and long-term retention of the trees. The proposal is, therefore, contrary to Policies G7 of the London Plan (2021) and policies DMHB11 and DMHB14 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "In the absence of sufficient biodiversity net gain information, it has not been demonstrated that the proposal would deliver at least a 10% increase in biodiversity value relative to the pre-development biodiversity value of the onsite habitat. As the proposed development fails to provide an appropriate biodiversity net gain, it is contrary to Schedule 7A of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as inserted by Schedule 14 of the Environment Act 2021), Policy G6 of the London Plan (2021), Policy EM7 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012), and Policy DMEI 7 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two (2020).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
