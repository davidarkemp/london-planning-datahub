    "Due to its depth, bulk, scale, massing, footprint and design, the proposed building would form an oversized, uncharacteristic and visually incongruous form of development which would fail to harmonise with the established character of the area and appearance of the street scene. The development's adverse visual impact would be exacerbated by the removal of vegetation and the Category B Tree (T3) which exists at the front of the site, and which currently contribute positively to the area's suburban and leafy character. The proposal would therefore be detrimental to the visual amenities of the streetscene and the character and appearance of the surrounding area, all contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012), Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12, DMHB 14 and DMHD 3 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policies D1 and D3 of the London Plan (2021) and paragraphs 130 (a) and (c) of the NPPF (2021).",
    "Unit E is a single aspect flat served by rooflights. Due to its poor design and lack of windows, future occupiers of this property would be subjected to poor levels of light, outlook, ventilation and air circulation to the detriment of their amenities. Furthermore, in order to access the development's cycle storage area and communal garden, future flat occupiers would have to walk directly past the window of Bedroom 1, Flat A. Consequently, occupiers of this room would have inadequate levels of privacy, adversely impacting on their living conditions and amenities. For these reasons, the proposal would provide a substandard and unsatisfactory residential environment for its future occupiers, contrary to Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021), Policy DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020) and paragraph 130 (f) of the NPPF (2021).",
    "Due to its depth, size and siting, the proposed building would lead to a harmful loss of light and outlook to the rear windows of No.18 Church Road. The loss of light, outlook and overdominance would have a material adverse impact on the residential amenities of the existing and future occupiers of No. 18 Church Road. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policy DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020) and paragraph 130 (f) of the NPPF (2021).",
    "The proposal fails to provide a step free access for units C, D and E. It also fails to provide a clear, well evidenced and compelling case as to why step free access has not been included in the scheme. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy D7 A (2) of the London Plan (2021), which requires all houses (which are created via works to which Part M volume 1 of the Building Regulations applies) to meet Building Regulation requirement M4(2) 'accessible and adaptable dwellings'.",
    "No legal agreement is in place to prohibit future residents of the proposed development from applying to join the Council's on street parking management scheme. In the absence of a satisfactory legal agreement, the proposal would not adequately mitigate against its impacts, as it would lead to displacement of parking, which would not be in the best interests of Highway safety. Consequently, the proposal would be contrary to Policy DMT 2 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020) and Policy T4 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "No Basement Impact Assessment has been submitted in support of the application. In the absence of such an assessment, the applicant has failed to demonstrate that the proposal would not cause unacceptable harm to the built and natural environment and local amenity and that it would not result in flooding or ground instability. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy DMHD 3 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan (2021) and national guidance.",
    "This is a reminder that Under the terms of the Planning Act 2008 (as amended) and Community Infrastructure Levy Regulations 2010 (as amended), should an application for appeal be allowed, the proposed development would be deemed as 'chargeable development' and therefore liable to pay the London Borough of Hillingdon Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and the Mayor of London's Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This would be calculated in accordance with the London Borough of Hillingdon CIL Charging Schedule 2014 and the Mayor of London's CIL Charging Schedule 2012.",
