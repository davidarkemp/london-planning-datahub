    "Due to its size, siting and position, the proposed dwelling would form an uncharacteristic, cramped and visually incongruous form of development which would obscure the host dwelling, reduce openness and subsequently fail to harmonise with the established character of the area and appearance of the street scene. The proposal would therefore be detrimental to the visual amenities of the streetscene and character of the surrounding area, all contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012), Policies DMH 6, DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021), as well as paragraphs 130 (a) and (c) of the NPPF (2021).",
    "By virtue of the position, siting and design of the proposed dwelling, in addition to the relative ground levels and limited separation distances, the proposal would give rise to harmful overlooking and loss of privacy between the proposed dwelling and numbers 170 and 172 Harefield Road. This relationship would provide an unacceptable residential environment for the future occupiers of the new dwelling, in addition to causing significant harm to the residential amenities of the neighbouring occupiers, all contrary to Policy DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020) and paragraph 130 (f) of the NPPF (2021).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan (2021) and national guidance.",
    "This is a reminder that Under the terms of the Planning Act 2008 (as amended) and Community Infrastructure Levy Regulations 2010 (as amended), should an application for appeal be allowed, the proposed development would be deemed as 'chargeable development' and therefore liable to pay the London Borough of Hillingdon Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and the Mayor of London's Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This would be calculated in accordance with the London Borough of Hillingdon CIL Charging Schedule 2014 and the Mayor of London's CIL Charging Schedule 2012.",
