  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed plans indicate amendments which would result in the installation of a new ground floor window on the west elevation that was not included in the original consideration of the approved development under planning permission 23469/APP/2020/3612.  The proposed changes cannot be considered as non-material when having regard to neighbouring residential amenity.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "a) We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
