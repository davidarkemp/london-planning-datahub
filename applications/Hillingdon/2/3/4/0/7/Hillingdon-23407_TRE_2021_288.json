    "The Oak (T220) is situated within the rear garden to the side of the property (The Spinney). Although Vine Grove is a private road, this Oak is the largest in the surrounding area and can also be seen from Court Park (LBH open space) as a result it has a high amenity value. It is a prominent landscape feature which significantly contributes to the arboreal character of Hillingdon Court Park Area of Special Local Character.",
    "No reasons have been provided by the applicant as to why the work is necessary. It is noted that the tree is situated close to the property however the recent planning application 23407/APP/2021/314 includes details about an installed root barrier around the tree. It is also unclear from the applicants work description whether the cut away from house is included in the 1.5-2m crown reduction or an extra undefined amount.",
    "As no reasons have been provided and the work description is unclear, the work is unjustified and will have a detrimental impact on the visual ameni",
