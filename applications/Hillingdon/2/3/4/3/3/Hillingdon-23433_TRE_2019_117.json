    "The tree(s) to be felled in pursuance of this consent shall be replaced in accordance with the details set out in the application. The replacement tree(s), which shall be of 'Standard' size (about 2-3m high) and short-staked for support, shall be planted during the first planting season following the felling works hereby permitted. Thereafter, the replacement tree(s) shall be retained indefinitely and maintained (watered and weeded during the spring and summer) for at least 2-3 years, or until established.",
    "REASON",
    "In order to comply with the requirements of Section 206 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990.",
    "Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981:  Note that it is an offence under this act to disturb roosting bats, nesting birds or any other protected species.  Therefore, if applicable, it is advisable to consult your tree surgeon / consultant to agree an acceptable time for carrying out the approved works.",
    "Risk of heave: You are advised that a risk of soil heave and heave-related damage to properties may arise following the felling / removal of trees. Therefore, it is advisable for you to obtain independent expert advice prior to carrying out the approved tree felling. Hillingdon Council cannot and will not accept responsibility or liability for any damages associated with the implementation of this consent.",
    "Stump removal: After felling, tree stumps are frequently colonised by honey fungus (Armillaria sp.) which is known to spread and colonise nearby trees. Some trees and woody plants can often be killed by honey fungus and, therefore, it is advisable to remove the tree stump and roots as soon as possible after felling.",
    "Expected standard of tree work: The approved works must be carried out in accordance with the conditions laid out above. If they are not, then enforcement action could being taken which could lead to prosecution and heavy fines. Therefore, it is highly recommended that the works are only carried out by a professional and competent arboriculturist who undertakes to comply with the conditions of this consent and in accordance with industry best practice (BS 3998:2010). The Arboricultural Association can provide details of its approved contractors, who have demonstrated such professionalism and competence, on their website (www.trees.org.uk) or by calling 01242 522152. Or on request the Council can provide a list of contractors who are known to carry out tree work to a good standard and to normally maintain an appropriate policy of indemnity insurance."
