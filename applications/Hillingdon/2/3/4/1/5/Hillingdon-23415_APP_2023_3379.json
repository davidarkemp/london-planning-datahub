    "The proposed development does not constitute permitted development by virtue of the provisions of Article 3, Schedule 2, Part 1, Class A of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015, as the proposed development would unduly detract from the residential amenity of the adjoining occupiers at no.95 Southbourne Gardens, by reason of loss of light, loss of outlook, as well as an adverse enclosing impact. The proposal is contrary to Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020) and Prior Approval is required and refused."
