    "The cumulative impact of the proposed two storey side extension, together with the first floor rear extension, by virtue of the overall size, scale, siting, bulk and massing of the resultant form and top heavy crown roof would result in the extension appearing as a cramped, insubordinate and incongruous form of development, that would unacceptably close the undeveloped gap between this and the adjoining property, No. 37 Newcroft Close producing a terracing effect. The proposal would therefore be harmful to the character and appearance of the host property and be detrimental to the visual amenities of the street scene, contrary to Policies DMHD1, DMHB11 and DMHB12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two (2020).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service. In order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably. In addition further guidance was offered to the applicant by the case officer during the processing of the application to identify the amendments to address those elements of the scheme considered unacceptable which the applicant chose not to implement."
