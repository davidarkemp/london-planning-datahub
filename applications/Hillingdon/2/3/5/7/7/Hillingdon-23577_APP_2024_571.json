    "The resultant development, by reason of the cumulative size, scale, bulk and massing of the proposed first floor rear extension in combination with the first floor side extension, together with its design (including the excessively large crown roof), would result in a visually dominant and incongruous form of development that fails to harmonise with the architectural composition of the host dwelling to the detriment of the character, appearance and visual amenities of the surrounding area. The proposed development therefore conflicts with Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One Strategic Policies (2012), Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy D3 of The London Plan (2021) and Paragraph 135 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023).",
    "The proposed development has failed to demonstrate that it would provide an adequate level of natural light or outlook for the future occupiers of a first floor bedroom  The proposal would therefore give rise to a substandard form of living accommodation to the detriment of the amenities of future occupiers contrary to Policy DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies and Policy D6 of the London Plan.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service. In order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably. In addition further guidance was offered to the applicant by the case officer during the processing of the application to identify the amendments to address those elements of the scheme considered unacceptable which the applicant chose not to implement."
