The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy EM6 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (Nov 2012), Policy DMEI 9 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020)), Policies 5.12 and 5.13 of The London Plan (2016), the National Planning Policy Framework (March 2012) and the Planning Practice Guidance (March 2014).",

We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "a) We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
