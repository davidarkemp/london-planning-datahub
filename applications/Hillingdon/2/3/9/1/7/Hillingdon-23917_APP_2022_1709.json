    "The proposed two storey side and rear extension by reason of its siting in this open prominent position, size, scale, bulk, width, roof design and projection forward of the return building line along this section of Ashford Avenue, would result in the closing of an important gap characteristic to the area, resulting in a cramped appearance and would fail to appear as a subordinate structure. The proposal would, thus, result in an over dominant and visually obtrusive form of development, to the detriment of the visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020)."
