    "By reason of its siting in this open prominent position, its excessive size, scale, bulk and width, incompatible roof design and projection forward of the return building line along this section of Ashford Avenue, the proposed extensions would result in the closing of an important gap characteristic to the area, disruption to the building line and a cramped development that would fail to appear as a subordinate structure. The proposal would, thus, result in an over dominant and visually obtrusive form of development, to the detriment of the visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area, contrary to Section 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021, Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020)."
