    "Due to its projection beyond neighbouring gable ends, the proposed first floor rear extension would break the uniformity and visual balance which currently exists along the rear elevation of the terrace block and neighbouring terrace block, subsequently harming the character of the terrace, neighbouring terrace and ultimately the character of the area. The extension would also result in the loss of the visual symmetry which currently exists between the gables of No.74 and No.76, harming the appearance of both dwellings, by disrupting and failing to respect their original architectural composition. The harm caused by the first floor rear extension would be visible from Clarendon Road and would therefore harm the areas appearance. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One- Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 11, DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020),  Policy D3 of the Lond",
    "Due to its height, size and close proximity to the single aspect kitchen of the existing dwelling, the proposed extension would cause a harmful loss of outlook and light to the property's kitchen, impacting adversely on the living conditions and amenities of its users. The development is therefore contrary to Policy D3 (D)(7) of the London Plan (2021) and paragraph 135 (f) of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan (2021) and NPPF (2023)."
