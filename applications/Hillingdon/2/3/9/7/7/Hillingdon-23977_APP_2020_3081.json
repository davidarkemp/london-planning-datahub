  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed two storey/first floor front extensions, by virtue of their siting in this visually prominent location, size, scale, bulk  and design would result in incongruous and discordant forms of development that would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original dwelling and would be detrimental to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
