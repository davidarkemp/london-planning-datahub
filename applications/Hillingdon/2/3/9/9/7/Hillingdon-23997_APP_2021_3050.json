    "The proposed part two storey, part single storey side extension to dwelling house, by virtue of its width, scale and design would result in an incongruous addition, which would be detrimental to the architectural composition of the existing building, the street scene, and would harm the character and appearance of the wider Barnhill Estate Area of Special Local Character. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policy BE1 of Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB5, DMHB11, DMHB12 and DMHD1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan - Part Two (2020) and Policies D4 and D8 of the London plan (2021).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "In order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably. In addition further guidance was offered to the applicant by the case officer during the processing of the application to identify the amendments to address those elements of the scheme considered unacceptable which the applicant chose not to implement."
