    "The proposed rear dormer roof extension, by reason of size, scale, siting and design, would result in an over-dominant and disproportionate form of development that would disrupt the visual relationship with adjoining sites and would therefore have a harmful impact on the character and appearance of the site and streetscape. As such, the development is contrary to policies DMHB11 and DMHD1 of the Hillington Local Plan : Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and Policy D4 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
