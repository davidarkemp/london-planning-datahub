    "The Cedar is situated to the front of the Hotel and can be seen from Bath Road. Bath Road is a major trunk road (A4) through the borough and as a result this Cedar has a very high amenity value. Whilst we understand the safety concerns of starlings in relation to airplane strikes there is currently insignificant evidence that the removal of this one Cedar will make a significant impact on the number of starlings in the area. It would also create an unwanted precedence for removing trees in the vicinity of an airport. Having regard to the reasons given for the proposed work, the work is unjustified and will have a detrimental impact on the visual amenity and arboreal character of the area.",
    "The removal of deadwood, dangerous / hanging branches and ivy:  This does not require the formal consent of the Council."
