    "REASON",
    "To enable the Local Planning Authority to reconsider the appropriateness of the works in the light of any change in circumstances.",
    "The stems of the trees to be coppiced shall be cut down to approximately 500mm high to leave a coppice stool. The final cuts shall remove the felling hinge/s and shall be made / angled in such a manner as to promote the subsequent re-growth of the trees.",
    "The works shall be carried out in accordance with the recommendations contained in BS3998: 2010 - \"British Standard Recommendations for Tree Work\".",
    "Reason",
    "In order to protect health of the tree and the visual amenity of the area.",
    "Timing of works:  Pruning works should not be carried out during the period of bud burst and care should be taken to ensure that branches are cut back to healthy outward facing buds to avoid die-back to which some species are prone. For major works, such as pollarding or copping, work should only be carried out after the autumn leaf fall when the sap has gone down, and certainly well before the sap rises in the spring before bud burst has taken place.",
    "Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981:  Note that it is an offence under this act to disturb roosting bats, nesting birds or any other protected species.",
    "Coppicing: This is a traditional method of woodland management where young trees are repeatedly cut down to near ground level. In this case, the tree(s) should be coppiced to a height of 2-3ft above ground level."
