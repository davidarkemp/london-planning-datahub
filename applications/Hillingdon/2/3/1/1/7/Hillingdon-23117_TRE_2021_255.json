    "The Lawson Cypress is situated within the rear garden of 9 Drysdale Close. This tree has a mature and attractive crown which is visible from multiple angles, including properties within Drysdale Close and Greenheys Close. The Cypress has a moderate amenity value and provides a significant contribution to the arboreal character of the local area.",
    "The applicants ask permission to fell the tree as it could create damage to the surrounding buildings. No evidence of damage to properties has been provided. Additionally, no Arboricultural Report has been supplied justifying the proposed removal of the tree.",
    "The proposed work to remove this Cypress will substantially affect the aesthetics and visual amenity of the area.",
    "Having regard to the reasons given for the proposed work, the work is unjustified and will have a detrimental impact on the visual amenity and arboreal character of the area.",
    "The removal of deadwood, dangerous / hanging branches and ivy:  This does not require the formal consent of the Council.",
    "Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981:  Note that it is an offence under this act to disturb roosting bats, nesting birds or any other protected species."
