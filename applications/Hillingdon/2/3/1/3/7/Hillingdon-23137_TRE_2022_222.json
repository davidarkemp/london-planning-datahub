Views of the crown can be gained between the houses and over the roofs from multiple angles from Briarwood Drive and Hazelwood Drive. As a result the Oak has a high amenity value and makes a significant positive contribution to the local landscape.",

The applicant has also provided no reasons as to why the work is required.",
