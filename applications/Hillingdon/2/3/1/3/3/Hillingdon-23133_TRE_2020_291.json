    "The removal of deadwood, dangerous / hanging branches and ivy:  This does not require the formal consent of the Council.",
    "The oak is located in the rear garden of 50 Elmbridge Drive and whilst views from Elmbridge Drive are partially obstructed by neighbouring properties, it is highly visible over the single storey properties in Grooms Drive to the rear. It makes a positive contribution to the landscape character and amenity of the area. The tree has moderate-to-high amenity value.",
    "Access to the rear garden was not possible and so the tree was inspected from a distance. At the time of inspection, the tree was found to be in reasonable overall physiological condition with no obvious significant structural defects.",
    "The proposed work will result in the removal of a significant proportion of the tree's photosynthetic area. The application states that the tree has been repeatedly pruned but the last record of an application for such works was in 2002. This is not considered 'routine maintenance' which was the reason provided for the proposed work in the application.",
