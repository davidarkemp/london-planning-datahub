    "The development, by reason of its height, bulk and proximity, would be harmful on the residential amenity of the neighbouring occupiers at Boleyn Court as a result of loss of outlook, loss of daylight/sunlight and sense of enclosure. The development therefore conflicts with  Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012), Policy DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local plan - Part Two (2020), Policy D3 of the London plan (2021) and Paragraph 135(f) of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023).",
    "The development, by reason of its height, depth, size, bulk, design, massing and balconies, would be harmful to the character and appearance of the area and the visual amenities of the street scene. The development therefore conflicts with Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 - Strategic Policies (2012), Policies DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021) and Paragraph 135(b) and (c) of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023).",
    "The development, by reason of its failure to provide an adequate provision of internal floor area and daylight/sunlight would be harmful on the living conditions of the future occupants. The development therefore conflicts with Policies DMHB 11 and DMHB 16 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020), Policies D3 and D6 of the London Plan (2021) and Paragraph 135(f) of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023).",
    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate that the development will have adequate passive ventilation, daylight, and avoid overheating. The proposed single aspect units would be harmful on the living conditions of the future occupants. The development therefore conflicts with Policies DMHB 11 and DMHB 16 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020), Policies D3, D6 and SI4 of the London Plan (2021) and Paragraph 135(f) of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023).",
    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate that the development is air quality neutral and that the harm and demands created by the proposed development in respect of air quality can be mitigated. The development therefore conflicts with Policy EM8 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 (2012), Policy DMEI 14 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 (2020) and Policy SI1 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "In the absence of satisfactory biodiversity net gain information, it has not been demonstrated that the proposal would deliver at least a 10% increase in biodiversity value relative to the pre-development biodiversity value of the onsite habitat. As the proposed development fails to provide an appropriate biodiversity net gain, it is contrary to Schedule 7A of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as inserted by Schedule 14 of the Environment Act 2021), Policy G6 of the London Plan (2021), Policy EM7 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 - Strategic Policies (2012) and Policy DMEI 7 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2021). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal.",
    "This is a reminder that Under the terms of the Planning Act 2008 (as amended) and Community Infrastructure Levy Regulations 2010 (as amended), should an application for appeal be allowed, the proposed development would be deemed as 'chargeable development' and therefore liable to pay the London Borough of Hillingdon Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and the Mayor of London's Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This would be calculated in accordance with the London Borough of Hillingdon CIL Charging Schedule 2014 and the Mayor of London's CIL Charging Schedule 2012.
