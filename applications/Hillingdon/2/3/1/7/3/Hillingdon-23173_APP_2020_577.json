  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed demolitions of the front boundary wall and the installation of a dropped kerb and off street car parking space, by reason of loss of historic fabric and plan-form, would add visual clutter and detract from the streetscene causing harm to the special architectural and historic interest of the Grade-II listed building contrary to Policies BE1 and HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 1, DMHB 2 and DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) Policy 7.8 of the London Plan (2016) and the NPPF (2019).",
    "The decision to REFUSE listed building consent has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE listed building consent has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two Development Management Policies (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan - The Spatial Development Strategy for London (2016) and national guidance."
