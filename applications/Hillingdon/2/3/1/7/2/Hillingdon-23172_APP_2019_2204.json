    "The proposed monopole and proposed cabinets, by virtue of their size, height, number and siting, would result in an obtrusive form of development which would not harmonise with the character and appearance of the street scene and surrounding area and would be detrimental to the visual amenities, open character and appearance of the Green Belt. The proposal is thus contrary to Policies BE1 and EM2 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies BE13, BE19, BE37, BE38, OL1 and OL4 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Saved UDP Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12, DMHB 14, DMHB 21, DMCI 3 and DMEI 4 of the emerging Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies with Modifications (March 2019), Policy 7.16 of the London Plan (July 2016) and the National Planning Policy Framework (February 2019).",
    "The proposal fails to adequately investigate the reasonable possibility of sharing existing facilities and alternative solutions for a monopole location, contrary to Policy BE37 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Saved UDP Policies (November 2012), DMHB 21 of the emerging Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies with Modifications (March 2019) and Chapter 5 of the National Planning Policy Framework (February 2019).",

    "The decision to REFUSE details of siting and design has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Unitary Development Plan Saved Policies (September 2007) as incorporated into the Hillingdon Local Plan (2012) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan - The Spatial Development Strategy for London consolidated with alterations since 2011 (2016) and national guidance."
