    "The amendment to Conditions 2, 3 and 27 of planning permission ref. 23658/APP/2021/1296 would constitute a material change requiring planning permission. The proposal does not constitute a non-material amendment and is contrary to Section 96A of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990. In particular, the extent and scale of the changes are not non-material and the replacement of the consented sedum roofs on the western elevation of the Heath Centre with roof mounted plant would have a material impact on the character and appearance of the locally listed building as compared to the consented scheme, the changes involve alterations on which neighbouring properties could reasonably expect to be consulted, the use of part of the basement results in additional floor space being added to the proposal and the changes have implications for the wording of the S106 Agreement."
