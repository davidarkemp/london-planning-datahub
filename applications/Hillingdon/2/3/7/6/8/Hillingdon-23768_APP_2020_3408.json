  "description": "Single storey outbuilding to rear for use as a office/store",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposal is for a detached structure which, by reason of its layout, facilities and independent access, is considered capable of independent occupation from the main dwelling and is thus tantamount to a separate business use, which would not be incidental to the enjoyment of the dwelling house and could result in unacceptable impact on adjoining occupiers and additional requirements for parking. The proposal is therefore contrary to policies DMHB 11, DMHD 2 and DMT 6 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "The proposal fails to ensure sufficient private amenity space for the existing 3 bedroom dwelling is retained as a result of the proposed outbuilding. As such, the proposal would be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policy DMHB 18 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2016). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service."
