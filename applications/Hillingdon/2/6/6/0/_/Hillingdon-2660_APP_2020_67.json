  "description": "Single storey rear extension",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed extension, by reason of its size, siting, parapet wall height, overall depth and projection beyond the main rear elevation of the adjoining property, would appear as an intrusive and visually dominant extension to the occupiers of No. 98 Hitherbroom Road, detrimental to their residential amenity. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan - The Spatial Development Strategy for London consolidated with alterations since 2011 (2016) and national guidance.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal.",
    "The submitted first floor plans appear to show the ground floor extending to the side boundary to the rear of the side garage adjoining No. 98 Hitherbroom Road and the originally proposed side extension adjoining No. 94 is still shown on the proposed side elevation. For the purposes of this determination, the proposed ground floor as shown on Drw. No. ART/2020/RE96HR/PL Rev. C has been taken to be correct."
