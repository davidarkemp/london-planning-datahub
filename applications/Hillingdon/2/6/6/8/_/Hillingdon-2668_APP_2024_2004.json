    "The development, by virtue of its failure to provide an adequate provision of private external amenity space and internal living space for the occupiers of the proposed development, would result in substandard living conditions to the detriment of the residential amenity of future occupiers. The development therefore conflicts with Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 16 and DMHB 18 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021) and Paragraph 135f) of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023).",
    "The development, by virtue of the proximity and first floor rear projection, would not maintain an adequate outlook and source of natural light for the occupiers of No.90A/B, resulting in harm to the amenity of the neighbouring property. The development therefore conflicts with Policy D3 of London Plan (2021), Policy DMHB 11 of Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and Paragraph 135f) of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023).",
    "The existing and proposed front and side elevations show a brick plinth under the shopfront and a step up from the street to the floor of the ground floor. This appears to be inaccurate as the entrance and floor of the shop appears to be level with the pavement. The existing and proposed front elevation also shows the entrance to the neighbouring properties at Nos.86A/B in a raised level relative to the street, which is inaccurate. The placement and size of the neighbouring windows and shopfront appear to be out of proportion and inaccurate.",
    "The decision to GRANT planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2021). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal.",
    "This is a reminder that Under the terms of the Planning Act 2008 (as amended) and Community Infrastructure Levy Regulations 2010 (as amended), should an application for appeal be allowed, the proposed development would be deemed as 'chargeable development' and therefore liable to pay the London Borough of Hillingdon Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and the Mayor of London's Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This would be calculated in accordance with the London Borough of Hillingdon CIL Charging Schedule 2014 and the Mayor of London's CIL Charging Schedule 2012.
