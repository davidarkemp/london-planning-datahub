    "The proposed front extensions, by reason of their size, scale, bulk, and design would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original dwelling and would be detrimental to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies BE13, BE15 and BE19 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Unitary Development Plan Saved Policies (November 2012) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document HDAS: Residential Extensions.",
    "The proposed two storey rear extension, by reason of its size, scale, bulk, width and crown roof design, represents an unduly intrusive and incongruous form of development, detrimental to the character and appearance of the existing and adjoining properties and the visual amenities of the street scene and the wider area. As such it would be contrary to policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies BE13, BE15 and BE19 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - UDP Saved Policies (November 2012) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document HDAS: Residential Extensions.",
