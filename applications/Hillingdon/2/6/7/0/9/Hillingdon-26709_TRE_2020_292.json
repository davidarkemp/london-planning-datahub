  "description": "To fell one Oak and replace with Birch or Sweet Chestnut, as in Area 1 on TPO198",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The removal of deadwood, dangerous / hanging branches and ivy:  This does not require the formal consent of the Council.",
    "The oak is located in the rear garden of 4 Warren Road and whilst views from Warren Road are partially obstructed by neighbouring properties, it remains highly visible. It makes a positive contribution to the landscape character and amenity of the area. The tree has moderate-to-high amenity value.",
    "At the time of inspection, the tree was found to be in reasonable overall physiological condition. The crown was a little sparse and some major deadwood was present, including one large dead branch which had already fallen on the ground. In addition, fungal fruiting bodies were identified around the lower stem and buttress roots so further investigations would be beneficial.",
    "The proposed work will result in the loss of a significant tree. The application states that the tree is in decline but very little detail or justification has been provided.",
    "Having regard to the reasons given for the proposed work, insufficient justification has been provided in the application and the loss of this"
