    "The Ash is located at the bottom of the back garden of 18 Evelyn Avenue. The tree is a large specimen with a widespread crown and a significant arboreal character. The tree is visible from the gardens of the adjacent properties and moderately contributes to the visual amenity of the area. The Ash greatly contributes to the local biodiversity by providing habitat for a great array of wildlife.",
    "The applicant asks permission to fell the Ash under the \"dead tree\" category, having also ticked the option within the application that confirms the tree is diseased or is matter of concern for potential failure; choosing this option requires the provision of a written arboricultural advice or other diagnostic information from an appropriate expert. No such written evidence from an expert has been provided. The applicant also states that sparse leaves appeared in late summer, which contradicts the request for felling the tree under the \"dead tree\" category.",
