    "Due to the combination and excessive height, bulk, resulting mass and incorporation of uncharacteristic features, the proposed extensions would form an oversized set of additions that would not be subordinate to the existing dwelling and fail to respect its original design and appearance. Due to its location, size and design, the resulting building would also form an unduly prominent, incongruous, and visually harmful addition to the, Area of Special Local Character and Frays Avenue. The proposed development is therefore contrary to Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 5 and DMHD 1 of the Local Plan, Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020), as well as Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021) and paragraph 135 of the NPPF (2023).",
    "In the absence of a sunlight and daylight report, the applicant has failed to demonstrate that the proposed development would have an acceptable impact on the neighbouring property no.15 Frays Avenue in terms of the reduction in the level of sunlight and overshadowing to habitable rooms within the property. As such, the proposed development is contrary to  Policies DMHD 1 and DMHB 11, of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021), and paragraph 135 of the NPPF (2023)."
