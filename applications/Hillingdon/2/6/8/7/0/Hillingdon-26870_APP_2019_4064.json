  "description": "Two storey side extension, single storey side/rear extension, single storey front/side extension, pitched roof to single storey front element, involving demolition of existing attached garage and carport",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed two storey side extension, by reason of its size, scale, bulk, design including the double hip roof profile and lack of a set back from the front would fail to appear as a subordinate addition and would be detrimental to the architectural composition of the original dwelling and the character, appearance and visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHD 1, DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "The proposed single storey front/side extension, by reason of its siting, size, scale, bulk, width and design would represent a prominent feature, which would fail to harmonise with the character, proportions and architectural composition of the original dwelling and would have a detrimental impact on the appearance, character and visual amenities of the street scene and the wider area. As such, the proposal would be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHD 1, DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the 'Saved' Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Local Plan Part 1, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service."
