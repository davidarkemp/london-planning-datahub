    "The proposal by reason of its scale (filling most of the garden) design, appearance and use of poor quality materials would result in an incongruous development at odds with the original design of this locally listed building which would erode and harm the special interest and character of this non-designated heritage asset. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policies BE1 and HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012), Policies DMHB 3, DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two- Development Management Policies (2020), Policy HC1 of the London Plan and Chapters 12 and 16 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023).",
    "The proposal would lead to a partial loss of outdoor space incidental to the existing Public House. Therefore, in the absence of sufficient supporting evidence to justify the loss of floorspace associated with the Public House, it would be contrary with Policies DDMHB 11 and DMCI1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two- Development Management Policies (2020) and Policy HC7 of the London Plan and Chapter 6 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan - The Spatial Development Strategy for London consolidated with alterations since 2011 (2016) and national guidance."
