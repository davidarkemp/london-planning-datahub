    "The proposal by reason of its scale (filling most of the garden and covering most of the rear ground floor) design, appearance and use of poor quality materials would result in an incongruous development at odds with the original design of this locally listed building which would erode and harm the special interest and character of this non-designated heritage asset. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policies BE1 and HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012), Policies DMHB 3, DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two- Development Management Policies (2020), Policy HC1 of the London Plan and Chapters 12 and 16 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023).",
    "The constructed development has failed to demonstrate that unacceptable levels of noise, disturbance and odour to surrounding residential occupiers would not occur. In the absence of any noise surveys, operational management plan or further mitigations measures, the application has failed to address the issues relating to neighbouring amenity concerns. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012), DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two- Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "In the absence of sufficient detailed information on the use of the outdoor covered area,  it has not been possible to undertake a full assessment on whether the proposal would lead to a loss of the existing space associated with the Public House/restaurant use. Given its overall size and without full details of how the space would be utilised and for what purpose, it has not been possible to determine whether it would lead to a partial loss of existing community facility. As such, it would be contrary with Policies DDMHB 11 and DMCI1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two- Development Management Policies (2020) and Policy HC7 of the London Plan and Chapter 6 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023)."
