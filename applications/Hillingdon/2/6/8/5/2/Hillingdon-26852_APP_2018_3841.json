  "description": "Demolition of existing conservatory and replacement with oak framed orangery (Application for Listed Building Consent)",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed extension by reason of its siting, size, scale, bulk, height and design, would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original Grade II Listed Building and would thus be would be detrimental to its character and appearance thereby failing to either preserve or enhance the historic fabric of the building. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies BE1 and HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), BE8, BE9, BE13, BE15 and BE19 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Saved UDP Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 1 and DMHB 2 of the emerging Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies, Policy 7.8 of the London Plan (2016) and the NPPF.",
    "The decision to REFUSE Listed Building Consent has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE Listed Building Consent has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Unitary Development Plan Saved Policies (September 2007) as incorporated into the Hillingdon Local Plan (2012) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan - The Spatial Development Strategy for London consolidated with alterations since 2011 (2016) and national guidance.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the 'Saved' UDP 2007, Local Plan Part 1, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service. In addition further guidance was offered to the applicant by the case officer during the processing of the application to identify the amendments to address those elements of the scheme considered unacceptable. However, the amendments were not forthcoming from the applicant and the application has therefore been refused."
