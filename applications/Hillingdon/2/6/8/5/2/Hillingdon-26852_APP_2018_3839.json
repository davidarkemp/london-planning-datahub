    "The proposed extension by reason of its siting, size, scale, bulk, height and design, would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original Grade II Listed Building and would thus be would be detrimental to its character and appearance thereby failing to either preserve or enhance the historic fabric of the building. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies BE1 and HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), BE8, BE9, BE13, BE15 and BE19 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Saved UDP Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 1 and DMHB 2 of the emerging Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies, Policy 7.8 of the London Plan (2016) and the NPPF.",
    "The extension, in conjunction with previous additions to the building and the addition of other buildings within the curtilage, represents a disproportionate change in the bulk and character of the original building and increases the built-up appearance of the site, thereby impacting on the visual appearance of the site and open aspect and visual amenity of the Green Belt. The development is thereby contrary to Policy EM2 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policy OL4 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Saved UDP Policies (November 2012), Policy DMEI of the emerging Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies, Policy 7.16 of the London Plan and the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the 'Saved' UDP 2007, Local Plan Part 1, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service. In addition further guidance was offered to the applicant by the case officer during the processing of the application to identify the amendments to address those elements of the scheme considered unacceptable. However, the amendments were not forthcoming from the applicant and the application has therefore been refused."
