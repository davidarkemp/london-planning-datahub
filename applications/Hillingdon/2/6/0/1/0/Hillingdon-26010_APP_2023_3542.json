    "The proposed single storey rear extension, by reason of its size, scale, bulk, depth and positioning, would be excessive and disproportionate to the original dwelling and would not appear as a subordinate addition. The proposal would therefore be detrimental to the character and appearance of the original dwelling, contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One Strategic (2012) and Policies DMDH 1, DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The proposed single storey rear extension, by reason of its size, scale, bulk, depth and positioning, is detrimental to the amenities of the neighbouring occupiers at Number  5 Maple Close, Eastcote Ruislip by reason of overshadowing and loss of daylight and sunlight to the rear garden and rear facing windows and loss of outlook from and dominance to habitable rooms contrary to Policies DMHD 1 and DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way.
