It is noted that the outbuilding under construction on site is not being constructed in accordance with the building indicated on the submitted plans and this CLD does not, in anyway, indicate that the building being constructed on site is lawful.",

Use of the outbuilding for purposes such as a living room, bedroom, kitchen, bathroom, study, as a separate unit of accommodation or for business purposes constitutes a primary use that is not incidental and likely to invalidate this certificate. Furthermore, the Local Planning Authority may pursue enforcement against breaches of planning control, which may involve legal action through the Courts."
