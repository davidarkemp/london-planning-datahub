    "The Lime tree is situated within the front garden of 149 Swakeleys Road, it appears healthy and significantly contributes to the Arboricultural character of the area. Swakeleys Road is a main trunk road through Hillingdon however the Lime is slightly hidden from view due to the larger Beech and Oak either side as a result this Lime has a Moderate to high amenity value with the potential for a long life.",
    "The applicant (147 Swakeleys Road) wishes to carry out their common law right and prune overhanging branches back to the shared boundary due to issues with sap. The issue of Sap from a Lime tree is not classed as an Arboricultural reason to carry out tree work. The Lime's canopy is restricted slightly due to the presence of the larger Beech and Oak either side as a result pruning back to boundary line is not deemed appropriate and might have an adverse effect on the Limes health.",
    "Having regard to the reasons given for the proposed work, the work is unjustified and will have a detrim",
    "The removal of deadwood, dangerous / hanging branches and ivy:  This does not require the formal consent of the Council."
