    "The proposed ground floor front extension would protrude beyond the original building line of the house and link with the existing porch to form an unduly intrusive and bulky front addition to the property, which would appear as an incongruous and awkward addition, harmful to the character and appearance of the original property and the visual amenities of the street scene. The proposal would therefore fail to accord with Policy DMHD1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies with Modifications (March 2019), Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies BE13, BE15 & BE19 of the Hillingdon Local Plan (November 2012) and HDAS: Residential Extensions.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the 'Saved' UDP 2007, Local Plan Part 1, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service."
