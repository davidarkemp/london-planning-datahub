    "The beech tree is located in the front garden of 90 Deane Croft Road, close to the boundary to no. 88 Deane Croft Road. The tree can be viewed by neighbouring properties and passing traffic and pedestrians. The tree does appear to be in decline, with an approximate 50%-60% live crown ratio. There is dead wood present throughout the crown. This tree is considered to have a moderate amenity value due to the visible reduced number of leaves.",
    "Although dieback and dead wood was noted within the crown, it is our opinion that felling the tree now is premature. Whilst we do acknowledge that this trees life expectancy may be reduced, this mature tree is still contributing to the arboreal nature of the area.",
    "Dead wood does not need consent from the Council to remove, and we advise that this is removed periodically to ensure the tree remains safe in its senescence.",
    "From the information provided, we do not believe that the trees current condition warrants the tree to be felled, and any risk the",
    "The removal of deadwood, dangerous / hanging branches and ivy:  This does not require the formal consent of the Council.",
    "Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981:  Note that it is an offence under this act to disturb roosting bats, nesting birds or any other protected species.  Therefore, if applicable, it is advisable to consult your tree surgeon / consultant to agree an acceptable time for carrying out the approved works.",
    "Owner(s)'s permission:  Permission should be sought from the owner(s) of the tree(s) and / or the owner(s) of the land that the tree(s) overhang prior to any approved work being carried out.",
    "Expected standard of tree work: The approved works must be carried out in accordance with the conditions laid out above. If they are not, then enforcement action could being taken which could lead to prosecution and heavy fines. Therefore, it is highly recommended that the works are only carried out by a professional and competent arboriculturist who undertakes to comply with the conditions of this consent and in accordance with industry best practice (BS 3998:2010). The Arboricultural Association can provide details of its approved contractors, who have demonstrated such professionalism and competence, on their website (www.trees.org.uk) or by calling 01242 522152. Or on request the Council can provide a list of contractors who are known to carry out tree work to a good standard and to normally maintain an appropriate policy of indemnity insurance."
