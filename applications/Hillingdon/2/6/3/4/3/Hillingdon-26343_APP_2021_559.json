  "description": "Single storey rear extension and single storey front extension including the conversion of garage to habitable use",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed alterations to the front elevation to 'square off' the property and the rear extension, by reason of their size, scale, bulk and design, would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original building, would be detrimental to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding Garden City, West Drayton Area of Special Local Character. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies BE1 and HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 1, DMHB 5, DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2019).",
    "The proposed rear extension, by virtue of its size, scale, bulk and proximity, exacerbated by the elongation of the roof to the rear would be detrimental to the amenities of the adjoining occupier at 35 Fairway Avenue by reason of overdominance, visual intrusion and loss of outlook and light. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020)."
