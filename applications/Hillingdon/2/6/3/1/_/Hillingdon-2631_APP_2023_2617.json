    "The proposed rear extension would result in a secondary extension to an existing extension, extending the property 6m beyond the original rear building line and exceeding the Council's recommended depth standard set out in Part B of Policy DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020). Due to its overall depth and significant increase in the footprint of the property, the proposal would not appear as a subordinate addition to the existing dwellinghouse. Furthermore, the proposed roof and eaves height of the rear extension would be set below the eaves height of the existing rear extension which would create an uneven roof form at the rear of the property and would not appear as a sympathetic addition to the property. As such, the proposed development would be adhoc and piecemeal, and would fail to be sympathetic or subordinate to the appearance of the original dwelling. The proposal would therefore have a detrimental impact upon the chara",
    "The proposed rear extension would result in a secondary extension to an existing extension that would be overbearing and overshadow the attached properties due to the mid-terraced nature and orientation of the two properties, and the combined depth and design of the existing and proposed extensions. The proposal would therefore cause harm to the residential amenity of neighbouring properties, contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020)."
