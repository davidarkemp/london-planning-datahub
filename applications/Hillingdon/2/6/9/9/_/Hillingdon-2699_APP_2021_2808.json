    "Due to its design, bulk, height and proximity to neighbouring properties, the proposed office building would lead to significant visual intrusion as well as a loss of views and light from the habitable windows of  No.101A Hillingdon Hill (first floor flat). The proposal would also have an overbearing and overshadowing impact on the garden of No.101A , whilst also causing a loss of light to the space and leading to a loss of views from the space. Views from the garden of 103A and 105 Hillingdon Hill would also be adversely impacted by the proposal, users of the gardens would be subject to significant visual intrusion and an adverse overbearing impact. Furthermore, due to its height the building would lead to a loss of views from the habitable room windows of No.103A and 105A Hillingdon Road (flats sited above the shops) as well as from the rear windows of No.101 Hillingdon Hill. For the reasons mentioned above the proposed development would be detrimental to the amenities of the adjoini",

    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, The London Plan (2021) and all relevant material considerations including the NPPF (2021).",
