    "The application has failed to justify the need for the layout of development which is likely to result in harm to protected trees, including but not limited to tree T5 which is a category A value tree. The application fails to demonstrate that these trees would be protected and retained in the long term. Accordingly, the development could result in adverse and irreversible impacts to landscaping, trees, biodiversity or other natural features of merit, detrimental to the visual amenities of the area and Copsewood Estate, Northwood Area of Special Local Character, contrary to paragraph 136 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2024), Policy G7 of the London Plan (2021), and Policies DMHB 5, DMHB 6, DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHB 14 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 (2020).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan (2021) and national guidance.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably. In addition further guidance was offered to the applicant by the case officer during the processing of the application to identify the amendments to address those elements of the scheme considered unacceptable which the applicant chose not to implement."
