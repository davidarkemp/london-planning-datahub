    "The proposed first floor side extension, in conjunction with existing extensions, by reason of their size, scale, bulk and design, would fail to appear as subordinate additions and would thus be detrimental to the character and appearance of the original house, the visual amenities of the street scene and the character and appearance of the wider area. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11,  DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "The proposed development, by virtue of its failure to provide amenity space of sufficient size and quality commensurate to the size and layout of the said development would result in an over-development of the site detrimental to the residential amenity of existing and future occupiers. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies DMHB 11 and DMHB 18 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "Inaccurate plans/elevations have been received and the information provided.  The depth of the extension on the floor plans and the rear elevation do not correlate."
