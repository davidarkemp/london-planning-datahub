    "The proposed extension by reason of its size, siting, bulk and design, would fail to read as subordinate to the host dwelling, harming its architectural integrity and resulting in an associated terracing effect, which would appear cramped and incongruous with the character and appearance of the wider street scene. As a result the development as a whole would fail to comply with Policies DMHD1 and DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The proposed works, by reason of size, siting, bulk and design, would result in an overbearing form of development harmful to the amenities of the occupiers at No 34 Wyre Grove through an increased sense of enclosure, contrary to Policies DMHD1 and DMHB11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two (2020) .",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan (2021) and national guidance.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "a) We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
