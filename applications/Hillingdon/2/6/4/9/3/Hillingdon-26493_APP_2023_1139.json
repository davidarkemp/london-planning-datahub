    "The proposed extensions to the dwelling, by reason of their cumulative size, scale, width, bulk, design and resulting large crown, would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original dwelling, and, in this open prominent position, close an important gap characteristic to the area, resulting in a cramped appearance and eroding the verdant character of the conservation area. The proposal would therefore represent an overdevelopment of the site to the detriment of the character of the original dwelling and the visual amenity of the street scene thereby failing to preserve or enhance the appearance and character of the Ruislip Village Conservation Area. The development proposal is therefore contrary to Policies BE1 and HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012); Policies DMHB 1, DMHB 4, DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020); Policies HC1 and D3 of the London Plan (2021);",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2021). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
