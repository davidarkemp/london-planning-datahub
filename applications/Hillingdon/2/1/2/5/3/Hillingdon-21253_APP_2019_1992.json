    "The proposed two storey rear extension and conservatory, by reason of their size, scale, height and design would represent a visually unsympathetic form of development that would would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original dwelling and would be detrimental to the visual amenities of the street scene and the wider area. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies BE13, BE15 and BE19 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Saved UDP Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHD 1 and DMHB 11 of the emerging Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies with Modifications (March 2019) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document HDAS: Residential Extensions.",
    "The proposed rear extensions, by virtue of its size, scale, bulk, depth and proximity, would be detrimental to the amenities of the adjoining occupiers at 14 Harvil Road, by reason of overdominance and visual intrusion. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to policies BE20 and BE21 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Saved UDP Policies (November 2012) and the Council's adopted Supplementary Planning Document HDAS: Residential Extensions.",
    "The proposal would result in the provision of a habitable rooms with limited outlook, natural light/sunlight and no ventilation resulting in an oppressive environment, to the detriment of the residential amenity of current and future occupiers. The proposal is thus contrary to Policies BE19, BE20 and BE21 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Saved UDP Policies, Policies 3.5 and 5.3 of the London Plan (2016) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document HDAS: Residential Extensions.",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant saved policies (referred to as policies from the Hillingdon Unitary Development Plan - Saved Policies September 2007), then London Plan Policies (2016).  On the 8th November 2012 Hillingdon's Full Council agreed the adoption of the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies. Appendix 5 of this explains which saved policies from the old Unitary Development (which was subject to a direction from Secretary of State in September 2007 agreeing that the policies were 'saved') still apply for development control decisions.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the 'Saved' UDP 2007, Local Plan Part 1, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service."
