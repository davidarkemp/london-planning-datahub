    "The lattice tower is an obtrusive form of development which would add visual clutter to the street scene and protrude the skyline of the Old Uxbridge/Windsor Street and Rockingham Bridge Conservation Areas. The development does not harmonise with the character of the area and is detrimental to local visual amenities. As such, it fails to preserve or enhance the character and appearance of the conservation areas or comply with Policies DMHB 4, DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHB 21 of The Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The existing lattice tower, by reason of its height and close proximity to residential neighbours, particularly those residing in Cochrane House, is unacceptably overbearing and harmful to their amenities. The development therefore conflicts with Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHB 21 of The Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2021). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020."
