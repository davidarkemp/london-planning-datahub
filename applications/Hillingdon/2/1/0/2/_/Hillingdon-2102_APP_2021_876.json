  "description": "Non-material amendment to planning application reference 2102/APP/2018/4231 (Redevelopment of the site to provide three buildings ranging from 2 to 10 storeys in height delivering 331 residential units and 710 sq.m of ground floor commercial floorspace (Use Classes A1, A2, A3, B1, D1 or D2), including the provision of private and communal amenity areas, child play space, car parking, secure cycle parking, refuse storage areas and other associated development (AMENDED MAY 2019) to amend the wording of Condition 16 (Contaminated Land).",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed amendment to the wording of Condition 16 (Part iii) would fail to ensure that risks from land contamination to the future users of the land and neighbouring land are minimised, together with those to controlled waters, property and ecological systems and that the development can be carried out safely without unacceptable risks to workers, neighbours and other offsite receptors. The proposed amendment therefore fails to comply with Policy DMEI 12 of the Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020) and the potential impacts need to be considered as part of a full planning application.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
