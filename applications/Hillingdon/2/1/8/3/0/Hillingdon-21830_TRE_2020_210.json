  "description": "To remove One Leyland Cypress T117 on TPO 90.",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "Situated within the rear garden of 40 Kewferry Road is a large Leyland Cypress which can be seen from Moor Park Road over the properties. As a result it has a moderate to high amenity value and significantly contributes to the Arboricultural character of the local area which is adjacent to Dene Road, Northwood Area of Special Local Character (ASLC).",
    "One of the applicants reasons for work is that the tree is soaking up all the moisture in the ground which lead to the grass dying in 43 Moor Park Road however the grass has already been replaced with astroturf and as a result this is no longer an issue. It was noted that there are some lower branches nearly touching the roof of the shed under the exemption to abate a nuisance; these can be reduced to ensure adequate clearance. The amenity value of the tree is seen to outweigh the perceived negative impact of the resident at 43 Moor Park Road.",
    "Having regard to the reasons given for the proposed work, the work is unjustified and will have a",
    "The removal of deadwood, dangerous / hanging branches and ivy:  This does not require the formal consent of the Council.",
    "Work to lift/ cut back low branches effecting the shed roof, by cutting back secondary and tertiary branches to provide up to 1-2m clearance between the roof and the tree branches (thereby abating the nuisance) does not require the formal consent of the Council."
