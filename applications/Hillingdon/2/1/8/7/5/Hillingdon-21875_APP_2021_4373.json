    "The proposed black weatherboarding and black windows introduce an uncharacteristic material finish and palate to the building and St Catherines Road streestcene which would fail to respect the character and appearance of the streetscene and wider area, resulting in an incongruous and overly dominant building on this prominent corner site. The proposal therefore fails to comply with Policies BE1 and HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020)."
