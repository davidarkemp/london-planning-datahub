    "The proposed extension to the existing garage, by reason of its prominent positioning along the street, scale,  and overall depth would create in an incongruous and visually intrusive form of development that fails to respect the largely uniform design of other garages within the street scene. The proposed development would also fail to harmonise with the established built environment on Rectory Way resulting in a detrimental impact on the character and appearance of the immediate street scene, the surrounding area and the neighbouring Ickenham Village Conservation Area. The proposal therefore fails to comply with Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12, DMHD 1 and DMHD 2 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "The application has been reviewed by the Highway Authority who consider that the proposed garage extension directly abutting the adopted public footpath would potentially compromise mutual - intervisibility resulting between users of the garage and pedestrians on Rectory Way to the overall detriment of highway safety contrary to Policy DMT 2 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020) and Policy T4 of the London Plan (March 2021)."
