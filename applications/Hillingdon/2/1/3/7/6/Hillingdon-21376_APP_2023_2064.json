    "The proposed rear dormer roof extension, by reason of its scale, bulk and design, would exceed more than two thirds the average width of the original roof, fail to retain a substantial element of the original rear roof slope and would constitute an overly-large roof extension that would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original dwelling, detrimental to its character and appearance and that of the Harlington Village Conservation Area. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 1, DMHB 4, DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020)."
