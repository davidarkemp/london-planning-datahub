    "The proposed pergola structure, by virtue of its siting, size, materials and prominent position would appear as an incongruous and unduly prominent form of development that would be tantamount to visual clutter.  As a result, the proposed pergola would cause significant harm to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the existing street scene and to the surrounding Hillingdon Village Conservation Area. Moreover, the proposed pergola would  fail to preserve or enhance the special architectural and historic interest of the setting of the listed building (Red Lion Public House). The proposal therefore conflicts with Policies HE1 and BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One Strategic Policies (2012),  Policies DMHB 1, DMHB 2,  DMHB 4,  DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan : Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020) and Policies D1, D3, D4 and HC1 of the London Plan (2021).",

    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan - The Spatial Development Strategy for London consolidated with alterations since 2011 (2016) and national guidance."
