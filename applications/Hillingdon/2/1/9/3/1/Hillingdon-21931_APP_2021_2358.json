    "The proposed single storey side/rear extension, by reason of its size, proximity to the side boundary and projection forward of the return building line on Ivy Close, would result in the closing of an important gap characteristic to the area, resulting in a cramped appearance. Also, the flat roof profile on the proposed single storey side/rear extension would fail to harmonise with the hipped roof profile on the main host dwelling at number 57 North View. The proposal would therefore be an unsympathetic addition and represent an overdevelopment of the site, to the detriment of the visual amenities of the street scene and the character and appearance of the surrounding area. The proposed development is therefore contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One Strategic (2012) and Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2016). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020."
