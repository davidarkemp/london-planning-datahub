    "The proposed front, side and rear extension by reason of its size, scale, siting and design would represent an incongruous and insubordinate addition, failing to harmonise with the architectural composition of the strong presence of the gables to the front elevation of the original dwelling and would be detrimental to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area (where the gables are a consistent feature). The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021) and Chapter 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The proposed front, side and rear extension by reason of its size, scale and siting, including the overall length of the rear projection, would be detrimental to the residential amenities of the adjoining occupiers at number 40 and 44 Halford Road, in terms of loss of daylight/sunlight, outlook and overbearing effect. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
