    "The proposed development fails to provide alternative off street car parking provision for the existing property at 172 Glebe Avenue and therefore the development is considered to be deficient in car parking provision with regard to the Council's approved car parking standards, leading to on-street parking to the detriment of public and highway safety, and therefore contrary to policy DMT6 of the Hillingdon Local Plan - Part Two (2020).",
    "In the absence of a Flood Risk Assessment in accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework and National Planning Practice Guidance, the application has failed to address the issues relating to flood risk and has failed to provide adequate solutions to mitigate the flood risk caused by the additional footprint created by the proposed works. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy EM6 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (Nov 2012), Policies DMEI 8 and DMEI 9 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policies  SI12 and SI13 of The London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2019).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service."
