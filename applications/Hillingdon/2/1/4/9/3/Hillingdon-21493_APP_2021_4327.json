    "The proposed front/side extension, by virtue of its design, materials, siting, combined height, width and forward projection including the wrap-around nature would result in a dominant, incongruous, visually intrusive and bulky addition that  would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original end of terrace dwelling, would be detrimental to the character, appearance and symmetry of the terrace row of which it forms a part and to the visual amenities of this prominent street scene siting and the surrounding area. Therefore, the proposal would be contrary to Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021), Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2021). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020."
