    "The applicant is advised that:",
    "1) Low Emission Diesel Generator - the back-up generator required to service the proposed development should be specified as a low-emission model. To ensure the emissions of nitrous oxides and particulate matter associated with the back-up generator are minimised as far as possible, it is recommended that a system compliant with the European Union's (EU) Stage V standard be procured. Plant compliant with Stage V will have reduced emissions of carbon monoxide, nitrous oxides, hydrocarbons, and particulate matter.",
    "2) An appropriate testing and maintenance regime should be put in place for the back-up generator, to ensure the system is run safely and efficiently. The regime should be designed in accordance with the maintenance requirements of the specified system and be implemented by the relevant member of staff, as appropriate.",
    "It is recommended that proof of acceptable implementation of the two items above is submitted to LBH during operation."
