  "decision_conditions": [
    "It has not been demonstrated that the design of the rooftop plant equipment to serve the ground floor restaurant unit satisfactorily mitigates noise and odour emissions and that it is not harmful to the residential amenities of neighbours As such the development is contrary to Policies DMTC 4 and DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), Policy  7.15 of the London Plan (2016) and the National Planning Policy Framework.",
    "The plant equipment, by reason of its siting including its location in front of a first floor residential window, size, scale and design results in an incongruous design feature, which is detrimental to the amenities of adjoining residential occupiers and the wider area, by reason of loss of outlook. As such the development is contrary to Policies DMTC 4 and DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2016). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020."
