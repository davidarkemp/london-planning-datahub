  "description": "Conversion of loft to habitable accommodation, to include raising of roof ridge and height of front gable, insertion of dormer windows and rooflights to front and rear roofslopes, ground floor infill extension to front and replacement of doors/windows on rear elevation with bi-fold doors (amended description)",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The development, by virtue of its bulk, scale, height, design, front dormer windows and relationship to the side garage roof, would result in a disproportionate, incongruous, top heavy and overly dominant form of development which is discordant with the property. Therefore the proposal would fail to harmonise with the unique architectural composition of the original dwelling and would subsequently harm the visual relationship with the immediate neighbours. The proposal relates poorly to other properties in the local area and would harm both the character and appearance of the street scene and the visual amenities of the surrounding area. As a whole, the proposal would be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012) and Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies. Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020."
