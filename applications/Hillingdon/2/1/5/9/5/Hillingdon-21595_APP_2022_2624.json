    "The proposed two storey rear extension and side and rear dormer, by virtue of its size, scale and design would result in an excessive, visually intrusive, disproportionate, incongruous and overbearing addition that would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original dwelling and the surrounding area of which it forms a part of, to the detriment of the visual amenities of the street scene along this section of Torrington Road and Cornwall Road and thus harming the character and appearance of the surrounding area. Therefore, the proposal would be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012) and Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The proposed two storey rear extension, side and rear dormers by virtue of the proposed windows, size, scale, bulk, height and proximity, would be detrimental to the amenities of the neighbouring occupiers at number 2 Cornwall Road, by reason of overlooking, loss of privacy, overbearing effect, sense of enclosure and loss of outlook. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "By reason of its poor level of outlook and natural light, the proposed 'bedroom 4' and 'living room' would give rise to a substandard form of living accommodation to the detriment of the internal amenity provision for future occupiers. The proposal would therefore conflict with Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The proposed habitable room windows on the ground floor and first floor of the southern elevation serving bedrooms would be detrimental to the amenities of the neighbouring occupiers at No. 10, No. 12 and No. 14 Torrington Road by reason of overlooking and loss of privacy.  The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The proposed extension and outbuilding, by virtue of its failure to maintain an adequate amount of private usable external amenity space for the occupiers of the extended property, would result in an over-development of the site detrimental to the residential amenity of existing and future occupiers. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012) and Policy DMHD 1",
    "and Policy DMHB 18 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "By virtue of its substantial size, scale, footprint, height, prominent location, and the openings facing Torrington Road, the proposed outbuilding would result in an incongruous and cramped form of development that would be detrimental to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012), Policies DMH 6, DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMDH 2 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policies D1, D3, D4 and D8 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "By virtue of its proximity, siting, size, scale and height the proposed outbuilding would cause harm to the living conditions of the existing neighbouring occupiers at number 2 Cornwall Road and their private amenity space, in terms of loss of outlook, overshadowing, privacy, sense of enclosure and overbearing impact. The proposal would therefore conflict with Policy DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The proposed outbuilding, by reason of its scale and the availability of independent access to it, would be tantamount to a self-contained unit in a backland position where such a development would be unacceptable in relation to the standard of accommodation for future occupiers, the impact on the character and appearance of the area and on the living conditions of neighbouring occupiers through noise and disturbance due to the increased activity and comings and goings. The proposal would therefore conflict with Policies DMH 6, DMHD 2, DMHB 11, DMHB 12, DMHB 16, DMHB 18 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policies D1, D3, D4, D6 and D8 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "There are mature trees located to the rear of the site and close to the boundary. In the absence of a satisfactory Tree Report and Arboricultural Impact Assessment, it has not been demonstrated that the trees will be unaffected by the development and provision has not been made for their long-term protection. For these reasons, the proposal would conflict with Policies DMHD 1, DMHB 14 and DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policies G1 and G7 of the London Plan (2021) and Chapter 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021)."
