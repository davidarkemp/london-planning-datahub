    "The proposed outbuilding, by reason of its provision of facilities required for day-to-day private domestic existence and the availability of independent access to it, would result in the creation of a self-contained residential unit in a backland position where such a dwelling would be unacceptable, due to the requirements of internal and external amenity space for future occupiers, and its detrimental impact on the character and appearance of the area and on the living conditions of neighbouring occupiers. The proposal would therefore conflict with Policies DMH 6, DMHD 2, DMHB 11, DMHB 12, DMHB 16, DMHB 18 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policies D1, D3, D4, D6 and D8 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "By virtue of its substantial size, scale, footprint, height, and prominent location, the proposed outbuilding would result in an incongruous and cramped form of development that would be detrimental to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012), Policies DMH 6, DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMDH 2 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policies D1, D3, D4 and D8 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "By reason of its poor level of outlook and natural light, the proposed self-contained residential unit would give rise to a substandard form of living accommodation to the detriment of the internal amenity provision for future occupiers. The proposal would therefore conflict with Policy DMHB 18 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy D6 of the London Plan",
    "(2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The proposed self-contained residential unit would have no private amenity space provision, and would therefore give rise to a substandard form of living accommodation to the detriment of the amenity of future occupiers. The proposal, therefore, conflicts, with Policy DMHB 18  of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "By virtue of its siting, size, footprint and self-contained use, the proposed outbuilding would unacceptably undermine the external amenity provision for the existing occupiers at number 1a Torrington Road, in respect to the size, functionally and quality of the retained rear garden space.  The proposal would therefore conflict with Policy DMHB 18 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "By virtue of its proximity, siting, size, scale and height and self-contained use, the proposed outbuilding would cause harm to the living conditions of the existing neighbouring occupiers at numbers 1a Torrington Road and 2 Cornwall Road and their respective private amenity space, in terms of loss of outlook, overshadowing, privacy, sense of enclosure and overbearing impact. The proposal would therefore conflict with Policy DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The use of the proposed outbuilding as a self-contained residential unit, coupled with the proposed access arrangements, would have a detrimental impact on the living conditions of neighbouring residents as a result of an adverse increase in the number of comings and goings and intensification in the use of the site as a whole, leading to an unacceptable increase in noise and disturbance for the existing neighbouring occupiers at numbers 1a Torrington Road and 2 Cornwall Road. The proposal therefore conflicts with Policy DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2016). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020.",
    "This is a reminder that Under the terms of the Planning Act 2008 (as amended) and Community Infrastructure Levy Regulations 2010 (as amended), should an application for appeal be allowed, the proposed development would be deemed as 'chargeable development' and therefore liable to pay the London Borough of Hillingdon Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and the Mayor of London's Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This would be calculated in accordance with the London Borough of Hillingdon CIL Charging Schedule 2014 and the Mayor of London's CIL Charging Schedule 2012.",
