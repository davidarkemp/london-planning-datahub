The removal of the prior to first use wording from Condition 4 would be contrary to these planning policies.",
    "In dealing with the application, the Council has implemented the National Planning Policy Framework requirement to work with the applicant positively and proactively. We have made available detailed advice through our statutory policies from the Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, and offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "We have, however, been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the proposal is contrary to our statutory policies, and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
