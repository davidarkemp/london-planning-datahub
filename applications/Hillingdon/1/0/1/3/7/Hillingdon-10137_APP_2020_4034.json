  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed rear hipped to gable end conversion, by reason of its design, scale, size, bulk and massing, would fail would appear as disproportionate and incongruous addition that would fail to respect the original roof form and architectural composition of the original dwelling, and would be detrimental to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the surrounding area. The proposal would therefore be contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020)",
    "The proposed rear hipped to gable end conversion, by reason of its size, scale, bulk, height, massing and proximity would have a harmful impact on the living conditions of numbers 42 and 46 Park Avenue and their private amenity space, , in terms of loss of outlook, over dominance and overbearing effect. The proposal would therefore be contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (February 2019),  Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012)  and Policies DMHD 1 and DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",

Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020."
