    "The proposed outbuilding, by reason of its size, height, scale and bulk, results in overly dominant and incongruous feature in relation to the site and the wider locality, and as such the development would be detrimental to the visual amenity of the surrounding area and would unduly lessen the sense of spaciousness in the area. Therefore the development conflicts with Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), and Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 2 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (January 2020) which collectively require that all new developments should achieve a high quality of design which enhances the local distinctiveness of the area.",
