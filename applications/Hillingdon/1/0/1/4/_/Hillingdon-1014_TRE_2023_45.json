    "The Pine is situated within the rear garden of 35 Nicholas Way, it's canopy can be viewed over the top of the property and as a result it has a moderate amenity value. It significantly contributes to the Arboreal character of the Copse wood Estate an Area of Special Local Character.",
    "The applicant has ticked yes to \"Condition of the tree(s) - e.g. it is diseased or you have fears that it might break or fall\" however they have provided no technical evidence. There is a lean to the Pine however no evidence has been provided to show that this is a recent change to the trees physiology.",
    "Having regard to the reasons given for the proposed work, the work is unjustified and will have a detrimental impact on the visual amenity and arboreal character of the area.",
    "The removal of deadwood, dangerous / hanging branches and ivy:  This does not require the formal consent of the Council."
