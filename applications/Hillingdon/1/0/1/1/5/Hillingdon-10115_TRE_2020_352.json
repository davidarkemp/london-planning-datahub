  "description": "To fell and Poison two Oaks, T3 & T4 on TPO 627",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "These two trees are situated in the middle of a row of mature trees along the school boundary and as a collective group this row has a very high amenity value, which is a significant and prominent landscape feature to those living in, and visiting, Green Lane and St Helens School. They contribute to local biodiversity and the adjacent Northwood, Frithwood Conservation Area. The benefit in amenity and biodiversity afforded by the trees is both present and future because they have the potential for long life expectancies.",
    "The proposed removal of T3 and T4 would create a gap in the row of mature trees along the school boundary line thus significantly reducing the amenity value of the group of trees as well as disrupting a valuable wildlife corridor.",
    "·\tAlthough currently the application is for the removal of two Oaks there is mention of removing three trees and reducing a fourth as a result if their felling is allowed it could be difficult to resist felling of other trees in the group.",
