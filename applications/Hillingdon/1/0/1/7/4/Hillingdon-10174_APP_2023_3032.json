    "The development, by virtue of its bulk and scale and its location on a corner plot, would result in an unduly prominent, visually incongruous and top-heavy roof form that would be detrimental to the architectural composition of the original property and character of the area. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2021), Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management (2020), Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021) and Chapter 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The rear and side extensions by reason of its size, scale, bulk, form and design would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original or existing dwelling and would result in the closing of an important gap characteristic to the area and this corner plot, resulting in a cramped appearance. Consequently the development proposal would harm the character, appearance and visual amenities of the property, the street scene and the surrounding area, contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020) and Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service."
