    "The proposed outbuilding and boundary treatment, by reason of their siting in a visually prominent position, size, height, scale and bulk, results in overly dominant and incongruous features in relation to the site and the wider locality, and as such the development would be detrimental to the visual amenity of the street scene and would unduly lessen the sense of spaciousness in the area. Therefore the development conflicts with Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), and Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 2 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (January 2020) which collectively require that all new developments should achieve a high quality of design which enhances the local distinctiveness of the area.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. The Council's supports pre-application discussions.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
