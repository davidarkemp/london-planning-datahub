  "description": "Single storey detached building to side for use as a granny annexe",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposal is for a detached structure which, by reason of its size, scale, layout and independent access, is considered capable of independent occupation and is thus tantamount to the creation of a self contained separate dwelling, where such a dwelling would not be acceptable due to its impact on the character and appearance of the host dwelling and the wider locality, the need for additional parking and amenity space and issues relating to impact on the existing and adjoining dwellings. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policies DMHD 2, DMHB 11, DMHB 12, DMHB 16, DMHB 18, DMT 2 and DMT 6 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), Policies Policy 3.5 and 7.4 of the London Plan (2016), the Housing Standards Minor Alterations to The London Plan (March 2016), the Mayor of London's adopted Supplementary Planning Guidance - Housing (March 2016) and the Technical Housing Standards - Nationally Described Space Standard (March 2015). a",
    "In the absence of a Tree Survey and Arboricultural Implication Assessment to BS5837:2012 standards, the application has failed to demonstrate that the development will safeguard existing trees on the site and further fails to demonstrate protection for and long-term retention of the trees. The proposal is therefore detrimental to the visual amenity of the street scene and the wider area contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policy DMHB 14 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies.",
    "The existing plans imply that the existing building is in use as an independent residential unit. The Council has no record of any planning permission being granted for this or of issuing any Lawful Development Certificate for it. The use is considered unlawful and the matter has been reported to the Council's Enforcement Team for further investigation."
