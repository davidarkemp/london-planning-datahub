    "The proposal provides insufficient on-site car parking and levels of trip generation would lead to additional traffic and parking in and around the roads in the local area to the detriment of the free flow of traffic and conditions of highway safety. Also, no clear and robust details have been provided to demonstrate how restricting the maximum number of attendees to the site to 75 would be managed or enforced. Furthermore, there are concerns that indiscriminate parking may block access to a nearby Network Rail RRAP (Road Rail Access Point) adversely affecting London's transport network and increasing the risk of danger to transport network users. The proposal would therefore have a harmful impact on highway and transport network safety, street parking stress and the free flow of traffic, contrary to Policies T1, T4 and T6 of the London Plan (March 2021), Policies DMT 1, DMT 2 and DMT 6 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (January 2020) and the Nation",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "a) We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal.",
    "This is a reminder that Under the terms of the Planning Act 2008 (as amended) and Community Infrastructure Levy Regulations 2010 (as amended), should an application for appeal be allowed, the proposed development would be deemed as 'chargeable development' and therefore liable to pay the London Borough of Hillingdon Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and the Mayor of London's Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This would be calculated in accordance with the London Borough of Hillingdon CIL Charging Schedule 2014 and the Mayor of London's CIL Charging Schedule 2012.",
