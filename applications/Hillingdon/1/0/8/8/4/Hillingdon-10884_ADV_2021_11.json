    "The signage by reason of its position, size and means of illumination, fails to respect the original design of the host building, is detrimental to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the street scene and detracts from the setting of the Botwell: Thorn EMI Conservation Area and adjacent Locally Listed Building. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies BE1 and HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 1, DMHB 4, DMHB 11 and DMHB 13A of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), Policy HC1 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2019).",
