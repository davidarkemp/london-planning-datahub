    "The cumulative impact of the proposed outbuilding with canopy, and alterations to the existing outbuilding to create one large structure by reason of its excessive depth, scale, bulk, design and subsequent massing would result in an overly dominant and visually obtrusive form of development which would be out of keeping with the pattern of development in the area, to the detriment of the character and appearance of the surrounding area. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12, DMHD 1 and DMHD 2  of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - (2020), Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021) and Chapter 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021)."
