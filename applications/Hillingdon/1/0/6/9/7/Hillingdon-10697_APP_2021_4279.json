  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed development, by reason of its inappropriate siting in a rear garden, plot size, scale and design (including the uncharacteristic 1.8 metre high fencing along the site frontage), would result in an incongruous and visually obtrusive form of development which would fail  respect the established pattern of development in the local area and the surrounding street scape. As such, the proposal would have a detrimental impact on the character, appearance and visual amenities of the existing street scene and the residential area as a whole. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012), Policies DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2- Development Management Policies (2020), Policies D1, D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The proposed development, by virtue of its proximity, siting, size, scale, bulk and height, would cause harm to the residential amenities of the private rear garden of number 10 Whitethorn Avenue, in terms of loss of outlook, sense of enclosure and overbearing impact. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012), Policy DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2- Development Management Policies (2020) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The proposed development, by virtue of the siting of the proposed 1.8 metre high fencing, bin store and cycle store in such close proximity to front habitable room windows of the proposed dwelling would result in a substandard form of residential accommodation to the detriment of future occupants, in terms of poor levels of outlook. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policy DMHB 16 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2- Development Management Policies (2020), Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The proposed development, by virtue of substandard pedestrian access, and a proposed new vehicle crossover being located at an acute angle, on the inside bend of Edgar Road and adjacent to proposed 1.8 metre high fencing would have a harmful impact on the safe use of the highway and impede the free flow of traffic. Also, no evidence has been submitted to demonstrate that adequate visibility splays could be achieved. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policies DMT 1, DMT 2 and DMT 6 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2- Development Management Policies (2020),  Policies T6 and T6.1 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan - The Spatial Development Strategy for London consolidated with alterations since 2011 (2016) and national guidance.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "a) We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal.",
    "This is a reminder that Under the terms of the Planning Act 2008 (as amended) and Community Infrastructure Levy Regulations 2010 (as amended), should an application for appeal be allowed, the proposed development would be deemed as 'chargeable development' and therefore liable to pay the London Borough of Hillingdon Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and the Mayor of London's Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This would be calculated in accordance with the London Borough of Hillingdon CIL Charging Schedule 2014 and the Mayor of London's CIL Charging Schedule 2012.",
