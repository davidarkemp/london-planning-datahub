    "The rear dormer roof extension and hip to gable end roof enlargement, by reason of its design, scale, bulk and siting would appear obtrusive within the street scene which will have a detrimental impact on the character and appearance of the Hayes Village Conservation Area. Consequently, the roof alterations including rear dormer roof extension, are considered to introduce unsympathetic additions to the host dwelling that would have an adverse cumulative impact on the character and appearance of the wider area and this form of development is not characteristic in the local area. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policies BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 4, DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), Policy D4 of the London Plan (2021) and the NPPF.",

We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service."
