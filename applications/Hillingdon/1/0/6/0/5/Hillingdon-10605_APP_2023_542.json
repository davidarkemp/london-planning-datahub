    "In the absence of any noise assessment and mitigation, the proposed hot take away use, including kitchen exhaust and extended trading hours beyond the existing lawful hours for the site, has the real potential for excessive noise disturbance, odour and general anti-social behaviour, detrimental to the amenity of surrounding residential properties. The proposal is therefore contrary to Paragraphs 174 and 185 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021, Policy D14 of the London Plan, Policies BE1 and DME 5 of the Hillingdon Local Plan (Part 1) 2012 and Policies DMHB 11 and DMTC 4 of the Hillingdon Local Plan (Part 2) 2020.",
    "By virtue of the isolated location away from an identified retail area, its proximity to residential properties, its proximity to a school and within an existing car wash use where there are no details relating to replacement waiting facilities for the car wash use, the proposed of the hot food take away would be out of context and the principle of the development is contrary to Policy E9 of the London Plan 2021, Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan (Part 1) 2012 and Policy DMTC 4 of the Hillingdon Local Plan (Part 2) 2020.",
    "By virtue of a lack of detail relating to servicing and deliveries and a lack of any car parking and cycle parking, it is not possible to satisfactorily conclude that the proposal would not have an unacceptable impact upon availability of on street parking or existing traffic flows on Harlington Road, contrary to Section 9 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021, Policy T6.3 of the London Plan 2021, Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan (Part 1) 2012 and Policies DMT 2 and DMTC 4 of the Hillingdon Local Plan (Part 2) 2020. :",
    "The proposal lacks storage for the likely generation of waste from the operations of the hot food take away, increasing the likelihood of poor storage and management of waste, contrary to Section 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021, Policies BE1 and EM11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan (Part 1) 2012 and Policy DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan (Part 2) 2020.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service. We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal.",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan 2021."
