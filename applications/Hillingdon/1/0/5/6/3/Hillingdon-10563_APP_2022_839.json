    "The proposed hip to gable extensions alongside the rear dormer by reason of the uncharacteristic roof transition, combined height, width and depth, would result in a dominant, disproportionate and visually intrusive form of development that would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original dwelling, would unbalance the relationship with the adjacent and nearby similar styled properties along St Margaret's Road of which it forms a part, character and appearance of the area and would be harmful to the appearance of the streetscene and surrounding area. Therefore, the proposal would be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012), Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021), Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The applicant has not submitted a Flood Risk Assessment and the application has failed to address the issues relating to flood risk and the proposal is therefore contrary to Policy SI12 of the London Plan (2021), Policy EM6 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012), Policy DMEI 9 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2016). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. The Council's supports pre-application discussions.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
