  "description": "Variation of Condition 2 (Accordance with Approved Plans) of planning permission ref. 1058/APP/2021/3423, dated 08-09-2023 (Demolition of the public house (Sui Generis) and erection of purpose-built student accommodation (Sui Generis) and associated common areas and facilities, landscaping, amenity space, bicycle and motorcycle parking, and refuse storage) to make design changes, remove affordable student accommodation from the development and replace it with market rent student accommodation.",

    "The proposed development would fail to provide any affordable student accommodation. Following an independent viability assessment, it is concluded that the provision of affordable student accommodation would be viable. The non-provision of affordable student accommodation is a significant planning policy conflict, which does not constitute a minor material amendment, and significantly weighs against the development in the planning balance, contrary to the objectives of the NPPF (2023), Policies H5 and H15 of the London Plan (2021), Policy H2 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 (2012) and Policy DMH 7 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 (2020).",
    "Whilst the proposed amended development would make use of a brownfield site, the non-securement of the nominations agreement means that the development does not constitute purpose-built student accommodation and does not contribute to meeting the identified need for student accommodation as was the case for the original permission granted. As",
    "The applicant has failed to secure Section 106 planning obligations required to mitigate the harm and demands created by the proposed development (in respect of securing the purpose-built student accommodation use, affordable student accommodation, highways works, parking management, lease restrictions on parking, travel planning, construction and employment training, carbon offsetting, canal towpath works, health infrastructure, public open space, and project management and monitoring). The scheme therefore conflicts with Policy DMCI 7 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 (2020); the adopted Planning Obligations Supplementary Planning Document (2014); Policy DF1 of the London Plan (2021); and paragraphs 55-58 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan (2021) and national guidance.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably. In addition further guidance was offered to the applicant by the case officer during the processing of the application to identify the amendments to address those elements of the scheme considered unacceptable which the applicant chose not to implement.",
    "This is a reminder that Under the terms of the Planning Act 2008 (as amended) and Community Infrastructure Levy Regulations 2010 (as amended), should an application for appeal be allowed, the proposed development would be deemed as 'chargeable development' and therefore liable to pay the London Borough of Hillingdon Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and the Mayor of London's Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This would be calculated in accordance with the London Borough of Hillingdon CIL Charging Schedule 2014 and the Mayor of London's CIL Charging Schedule 2012.",
