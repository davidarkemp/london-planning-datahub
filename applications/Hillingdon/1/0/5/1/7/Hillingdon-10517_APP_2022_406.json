  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed development, by reason of its excessive size, scale, bulk, height, depth, roof form, design and siting along the shared boundary with No. 96, would be detrimental to the amenities of the neighbouring occupier at No.96 Swakeleys Road, by reason of overdominance, overshadowing, loss of daylight, loss of outlook and creating a sense of enclosure. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policies BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHD 1, DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "The proposed development, by reason of its excessive size, scale, bulk, height, roof form and design would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original dwelling and would be detrimental to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local plan - Part Two (2020) and Policy D3 of the London plan (2021).",
    "The property lies within Flood zones 2 and 3, the Functional Floodplain and Flood Map for Surface Water. A Flood Risk Assessment has not been provided to assess the risk to the property and show how it would be managed to ensure the future occupants will be safe and neighbouring properties would not be adversely affected. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policy EM6 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1- Strategic Policies (Nov 2012), Policy DMEI 9 Management of Flood Risk in Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 - Development Management Policies  (Jan 2020) and the NPPF.",

We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the Local Plan Part 1 and Local Plan Part 2. In addition further guidance was offered to the applicant by the case officer during the processing of the application to identify the amendments to address those elements of the scheme considered unacceptable which the applicant chose not to implement."
