  "description": "Single storey rear extension and conversion of roof space to habitable use to include a rear dormer and conversion of roof from hip to gable end with 2 x porches to front",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed single storey rear extension by virtue of its siting, size, scale and design, would fail to appear as a subordinate addition and would thus be detrimental to the appearance of the original semi-detached property and to the  visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB11 and DMHD1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The proposed roof alteration/extensions, by reason of the hip to gable end roof design and siting, size, scale, bulk and design of the rear dormer, would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original building, the character, appearance and symmetry of the pair of semi-detached buildings of which it forms a part and the visual amenities of the street scene and the wider area. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB11 and DMHD1 of the Hillingddon Local Plan - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The proposed front porch, by reason of the design and siting, would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original building, the character, appearance and symmetry of the pair of semi-detached buildings of which it forms a part and the visual amenities of the street scene and the wider area. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB11 and DMHD1 of the Hillingddon Local Plan - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The proposed single storey rear extension, by reason of its size, scale, bulk, depth and proximity, would be detrimental to the amenities of the adjoining occupiers at 48, 52 and 52A Willow Tree Lane by reason of overdominance, overshadowing, visual intrusion, loss of light and loss of outlook. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to  Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The proposal, by reason of the siting of the ground floor flank bedroom window serving bedroom 2, given its proximity to the side boundary would result in the provision of a habitable room with no outlook and limited levels of natural lighting that would result in a substandard form of living accommodation and reliance upon artificial means of lighting which would fail to satisfy sustainability and energy efficiency objectives and would be to the detriment of the amenity of future occupiers, contrary to Policies 3.5 and 5.3 of the London Plan (March 2016).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2016). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part Two (2020) Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service. This is a resubmission of a previously refused scheme, where the Officers Report identified issues to be addressed, which were reflected in the reasons for refusal, allowing the opportunity to address those issues within this submission."
