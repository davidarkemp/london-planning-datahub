  "description": "First floor side/rear extension.",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed first floor side extension, by reason of its overall size and proximity to the side boundary, would result in a closing of the visually open gap between it and the neighbouring property, 12 Oxford Avenue, giving rise to a cramped form of development, which would be detrimental to the visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area generally.  The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "The proposed first floor rear extension, by reason of its size, scale, bulk, depth and roof design would be a discordant and incongruous addition which would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original dwelling, would be detrimental to the character and appearance  of the terrace of houses of which it forms a part and to the visual amenities of the surrounding area. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2021). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service."
