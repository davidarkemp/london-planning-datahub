    "The proposed attached house by reason of its position on this open prominent corner site would reduce the visual openness and result in the closing of an important gap, characteristic to the area, which currently exists at this road junction, giving rise to a cramped form of development. The proposal, by reason of size and design, would also read as visually incongrous in relation to other dwellings. The proposal would therefore be detrimental to the character and visual amenities of the street scene and the wider area and contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 11 and  DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and Policies D4 and D8 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "The proposed dwellinghouse, by virtue of its overall size, scale, bulk, height, siting and proximity, would be detrimental to the amenities of the adjoining occupiers at 2A and 2 Birch Avenue by reason of overdominance, overshadowing, visual intrusion, loss of light and loss of outlook. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to policy DMHB11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020)",
    "The proposed dwellinghouse, by reason of the siting and position of the proposed first floor rear windows, would result in the direct overlooking of the adjoining properties at 2A and 2 Birch Avenue causing an unacceptable loss of their privacy. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy DMHB11 of the  Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the 'Saved' UDP 2007, Local Plan Part 1, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service. This is a resubmission of a previously refused scheme, where the Inspectors Report identified issues to be addressed, which were reflected in the reasons for refusal, allowing the opportunity to address those issues within this submission."
