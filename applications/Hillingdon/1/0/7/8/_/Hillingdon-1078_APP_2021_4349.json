    "The proposed shisha area would detract from the character and appearance of the Locally Listed Building, adding clutter and unbalancing the elevations and harming its significance as a non-designated heritage asset,  failing to conserve or enhance the Hayes Village Conservation Area in conflict with policies BE1 and HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan (November 2012), policies DMHB3, DMHB4, DMHB11 and DMHB12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two (2020) , Policies D8 and HC1 of the London Plan (2021) and the NPPF (2021).",
    "The proposed development fails to demonstrate that unacceptable levels of noise, disturbance and odour to surrounding residential occupiers would be appropriately mitigated. The proposed development would therefore harm the residential amenity of neighbouring occupiers and the general amenities of the area, contrary to Policies DMTC 4, DMHB 11 and DMEI 14 of the Hillingdon Local Plan - Part Two (2020) and Policy D14 of the London plan (2021)",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to GRANT/REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan (2021).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
