  "description": "Change of use of existing first floor residential unit above public house to 10-bedroom House of Multiple Occupancy (HMO)",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposal would provide an indoor living area of an unsatisfactory quality for the future occupiers of 3 of the proposed HMO rooms and would therefore give rise to a substandard form of living accommodation to the detriment of the amenity of future occupiers. The proposal is thus contrary Policies DMH 5 and DMHB 16 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and Policy 3.5 of the London Plan (2016).",
    "The proposal would provide an indoor living area of an unsatisfactory quality for the future occupiers of the proposed HMO in that no communal living room other than a kitchen is proposed to serve up to 18 occupants and would therefore give rise to a substandard form of living accommodation to the detriment of the amenity of future occupiers. The proposal is thus contrary Policies DMH 5 and DMHB 16 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and Policy 3.5 of the London Plan (2016).",
    "In the absence of a Noise survey, the applicant has failed to demonstrate that the future occupants of the HMO would not suffer an unacceptable level of noise and disturbance resulting from traffic noise and noise from the ground floor commercial use. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy DMH 5 and DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The proposal fails to provide amenity space of sufficient size and quality commensurate to the size and layout of the said HMO rooms. As such the proposal would provide a substandard form of accommodation for future residents contrary to Policy DMH 5 and DMHB 18 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan - The Spatial Development Strategy for London consolidated with alterations since 2011 (2016) and national guidance.",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2016). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
