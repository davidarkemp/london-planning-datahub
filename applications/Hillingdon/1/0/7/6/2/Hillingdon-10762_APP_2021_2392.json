    "The proposed outbuilding, by virtue of its siting, size, scale, bulk, design and height, would be detrimental to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11, DMHD 1 and DMHD 2 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "The proposed outbuilding, by virtue of its size, scale, bulk, height, design and proximity, would be detrimental to the amenities of the adjoining residential occupiers, by reason of overdominance, visual intrusion and loss of outlook. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policies DMHB 11, DMHD 1 and DMHD 2 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "The proposed development, by virtue of its failure to maintain an adequate amount of private usable external amenity space for the occupiers of the extended property, would result in an over-development of the site detrimental to the residential amenity of existing and future occupiers. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies DMHB 18, DMHD 2 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant saved policies (referred to as policies from the Hillingdon Unitary Development Plan - Saved Policies September 2007), then London Plan Policies (2015). On the 8th November 2012 Hillingdon's Full Council agreed the adoption of the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies. Appendix 5 of this explains which saved policies from the old Unitary Development (which was subject to a direction from Secretary of State in September 2007 agreeing that the policies were 'saved') still apply for development control decisions.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. The Council's supports pre-application discussions. We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
