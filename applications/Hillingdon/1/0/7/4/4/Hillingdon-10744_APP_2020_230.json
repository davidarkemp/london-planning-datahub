  "description": "Addition of a third floor to create 1 x 3-bed and 2 x 1-bed self contained flats in addition to alterations to the existing building",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed development, by reason of its siting, size, scale, bulk, height and design, would result in a visually intrusive form of development, which would fail to harmonise with the existing local and historic context of the surrounding area. As such the proposal would have a detrimental impact on the character, appearance and visual amenities of the existing building, the wider streetscene and the adjacent Grade II Listed Building. The proposal is thus contrary to Policies BE1 and HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 2, DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The proposed development, by virtue of its siting, size, scale, bulk and proximity, would be detrimental to the amenities of the adjoining occupiers at 108 Pembroke Road, by reason of loss of light and direct sunlight. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policy DMHB 11 of the Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2016). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service."
