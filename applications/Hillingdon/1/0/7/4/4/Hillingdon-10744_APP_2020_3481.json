  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed development, by by virtue of the provision of the balconies on the internal north and south elevations on the eastern side of the building  would be detrimental to the amenities of the adjoining occupiers at 108 Pembroke Road and the future occupiers of these flats, by reason of loss of privacy. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policy DMHB 11 of the Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The proposed development, by virtue of the depth of the balconies fails to provide a usable quality amenity space to the detriment of the residential amenity of future occupiers. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policy DMHB 18 of the Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2016). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020.",
