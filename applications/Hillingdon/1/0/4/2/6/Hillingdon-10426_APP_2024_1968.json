    "The applicant failed to support the proposed change of use from C3 (residential) to C1 (Bed and Breakfast) outside of a town centre with an appropriate sequential test. The development would also result in the unjustified loss of self-contained housing. The proposed development is therefore considered to be contrary to  Policies DME 5 and DMH 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 (2020), Policy E10 of The London Plan (2021) and Paragraph 91 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023).",
    "The applicant failed to demonstrate that the development would provide an adequate quantum of off-street parking spaces and accessible cycle parking spaces, in accordance with adopted parking standards. The proposed development is therefore considered to be contrary to Policies DMT 1, DMT 2, DMT 5 and DMT 6 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), as well as Policies T2, T4, T5 and T6 of the London Plan and Paragraph 116 of the NPPF (2023).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2021). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
