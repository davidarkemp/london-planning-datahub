    "The proposed development, in particular the single storey side, single storey rear extensions, patio and porch, by virtue of its combined height, design, roof form, materials and massing would result in a visually intrusive, disproportionate, incongruous, dominant and overbearing development that would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original dwelling, harming the appearance of the dwelling and  character, appearance and visual amenities of the surrounding area. Therefore, the proposal would be contrary to Section 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF - 2021), Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021), Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012) and Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The proposal, particularly the significant increase in height of the rear extension, the increase in height and scale of patio, and the loss of the high glass screen by reason of its size, scale, siting and design would harm the residential amenity of neighbouring properties at No. 7 and No. 9 Hamlin Crescent through overdominance, loss of outlook, overlooking and loss of privacy. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policy DMHD1 and Policy DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020)."
