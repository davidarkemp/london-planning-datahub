    "The proposed first floor and roof additions by reason of their siting, scale, bulk, height and design would be incongruous and disproportionate, resulting in poor design that would fail to respect the architectural integrity of the host dwelling. The proposal would therefore harm the visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area, all contrary to Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service."
