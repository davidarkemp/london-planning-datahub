    "The Oak tree is situated within the rear garden of 31 Warren Road. It can be seen from the public highway from above the properties and has a Moderate to High amenity value. It significantly contributes to the arboreal character of the local area and has the potential for a long life.",
    "The Oak tree has an attractive natural canopy typical of its species. The applicant wishes to carry out the work \"as part of continued maintenance\" however apart from a partial cut back and lift in 2011 the canopy as not been fully reduced. The tree's location within the garden is seen to be appropriate for its size and to unnecessarily prune this tree would not only harm the amenity it provides to the area, but also add unnecessary injury to it which may cause dysfunction.",
    "Having regard to the reasons given for the proposed work, the work is unjustified and will have a detrimental impact on the visual amenity and arboreal character of the area.",
    "The removal of deadwood, dangerous / hanging branches and ivy:  This does not require the formal consent of the Council."
