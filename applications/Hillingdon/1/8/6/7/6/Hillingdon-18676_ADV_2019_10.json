    "The proposed signage to the eastern elevation at first floor level and the two free standing signs by reason of their size, scale, location and overall appearance, would appear visually intrusive and would thus fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original Grade II Listed Building and would be detrimental to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the street scene and would fail to either preserve or enhance the character or appearance of the surrounding Uxbridge Moor Conservation Area or the Grade II Listed Building. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies BE1 and HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies BE4, BE8, BE13 and BE27 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Saved UDP Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 1, DMHB 2 and DMHB 4 of the emerging Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies with Modifications (March 2019), Policy 7.8 of the London Plan (2016), the adopt",

In the absence of sufficient information it is not possible to ascertain the impact of the proposal on the historic fabric and features of this Grade II Listed Building. By virtue of this and the fact the proposal could result in the loss of/damage to the historic fabric and features of the Listed Building, its setting and its wider context within the Uxbridge Moor Conservation Area it is therefore considered that the proposal is contrary to Policies BE1 and HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies BE4, BE8, BE13, BE27 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Saved UDP Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 1, DMHB 2 and DMHB 4 of the emerging Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies with Modifications (March 2019), the Policy 7.8 of the",
