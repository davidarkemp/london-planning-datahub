    "The proposed signage would add unsightly clutter to the elevations and would appear incongruous. The resultant impact would be harmful in terms of visual amenity and detract from the character and appearance of the conservation area and the Listed Building to which it would be attached, contrary to Local Plan Policies DMHB1. DMHB4, DMHB11, DMHB 13/13A of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two (2020).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
