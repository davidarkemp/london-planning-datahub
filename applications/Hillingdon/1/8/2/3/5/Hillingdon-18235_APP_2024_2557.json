    "The proposed layout fails to demonstrate that it would be designed and constructed as an accessible and adaptable dwelling in accordance with M4(2) technical specifications as set out in Approved Document M to the Building Regulations (2015 edition). As such the proposed development is contrary to Policy D7 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "The property is shown in Flood zone 2, which can be found on the Environment Agency website and therefore a Flood Risk Assessment (FRA) must be submitted. In the absence of a FRA, the applicant has failed to assess the flood risks to the property and demonstrate appropriate flood mitigation and resilience measures to ensure that future occupants will be safe throughout the lifetime of the development. As such the proposed development is contrary to Policy DMEI 9 the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and Policy SI12 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "The proposed layout in terms of the lack of policy compliant floor to ceiling heights within the proposed new dwelling, would result in inadequate living conditions for the future occupiers of this development. As such the proposed development is contrary to Policy DMHB 11 and DMHB 16 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2021). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal.",
    "This is a reminder that Under the terms of the Planning Act 2008 (as amended) and Community Infrastructure Levy Regulations 2010 (as amended), should an application for appeal be allowed, the proposed development would be deemed as 'chargeable development' and therefore liable to pay the London Borough of Hillingdon Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and the Mayor of London's Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This would be calculated in accordance with the London Borough of Hillingdon CIL Charging Schedule 2014 and the Mayor of London's CIL Charging Schedule 2012.
