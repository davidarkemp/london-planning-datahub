    "The proposal, by virtue of the artificial nature of the screening along the frontage, would add a discordant addition to the front of the property which visually fails to integrate with the existing site frontage as well as detracting from the character and appearance of the wider street scene. It would lead  to a detrimental visual impact on the character and appearance of the immediate street scene as well as the wider local character thereby contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012) and Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
