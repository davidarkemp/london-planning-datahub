    "Due to the combination of its excessive width, depth and height the proposed extension would form an oversized and bulky addition to the dwelling. Its failure to form a visually subordinate addition to the dwelling, would cause harm to the character and appearance of the dwelling. Additionally the resulting wrap around extension would engulf the majority of the properties ground floor elevations, obscuring and disrupting its original appearance. The extension would also result in a house which has been disproportiatley extended when compared with its original footprint, causing further harm to its original character. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "Due to the combination of its excessive width, depth, height and siting on a prominent corner plot, the proposed extension would lead to the loss of the openness which currently characterises the corner of the road, subsequently harming the areas character and appearance. Further harm would be caused to the area's character as the extension would break the Blacklands Drive building line, subsequently creating an unduly prominent and harmful addition to that streetscene and the surrounding area. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12, DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020) and paragraph 130 of the NPPF (2021)."
