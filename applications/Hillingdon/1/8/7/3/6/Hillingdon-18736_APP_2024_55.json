    "The submitted planning application fails to comprehensively demonstrate that the proposal would not give rise to adverse impacts upon the highway network to the detriment of highway congestion/safety contrary to Policies DMT 1, and DMT 2 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 (2020), Policy T4 of the London Plan (2021), Policies WLWP3 and WLWP4 of the West London Waste Plan (2015) and Paragraph 115 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023).",
    "The applicant has failed to secure the Section 106 planning obligation required to mitigate the harm and demands created by the proposed development (in respect of air quality, and project management and monitoring). As such, the development is contrary to Policy EM8 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 (2012), Policies DMCI 7 and DMEI 14 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 (2020), the adopted Planning Obligations Supplementary Planning Document (2014), Policies DF1 and SI1 of the London Plan (2021), Policies WLWP3 and WLWP4 of the West London Waste Plan (2015) and Paragraphs 55-58 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023).",
    "In the absence of sufficient biodiversity net gain information, it has not been demonstrated that the proposal would deliver at least a 10% increase in biodiversity value relative to the pre-development biodiversity value of the onsite habitat. As the proposed development fails to provide an appropriate biodiversity net gain, it is contrary to Policy EM7 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part One (2012), Policies DMEI 7 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two (2020), Policy G6 of the London Plan (2021) and Schedule 7A of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as inserted by Schedule 14 of the Environment Act 2021).",
    "In the absence of satisfactory information and having regard to reasons for refusal 1-3 above, it has not been demonstrated that there will be a shortfall in the waste management capacity required to meet the Boroughs' joint apportionment target as specified in Policy WLWP 1; or that the proposal would not result in an adverse cumulative effect, when taken together with existing waste management facilities, on the well-being of the local community, including any significant adverse impacts against the WLWP sustainability objectives. The principle of development is therefore considered to be unacceptable. As such, the development is contrary to Policies WLWP3 and WLWP4 of the West London Waste Plan (2015).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan - The Spatial Development Strategy for London consolidated with alterations since 2011 (2016) and national guidance.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal.",
    "This is a reminder that Under the terms of the Planning Act 2008 (as amended) and Community Infrastructure Levy Regulations 2010 (as amended), should an application for appeal be allowed, the proposed development would be deemed as 'chargeable development' and therefore liable to pay the London Borough of Hillingdon Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and the Mayor of London's Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This would be calculated in accordance with the London Borough of Hillingdon CIL Charging Schedule 2014 and the Mayor of London's CIL Charging Schedule 2012.",
