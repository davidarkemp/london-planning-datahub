  "description": "Two storey side/rear extension, single storey rear extension, first floor rear terrace, conversion of roofspace to habitable use to include a rear dormer and external alterations to elevations",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed two storey side/rear extension, by reason of its siting in this visually prominent position, and its cumulative width, size, scale, bulk and design (including the fenestration treatment), would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original semi-detached dwelling, would be detrimental to the character, appearance and symmetry of the pair of semi-detached houses of which it forms a part, to the visual amenities of the street scene and would fail to either preserve or enhance the character or appearance of the surrounding Rockingham Bridge Conservation Area. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies BE1 and HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 1, DMHB 4, DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), Policy 7.8 of the London Plan (2016) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2019).",
    "The proposed extension by reason of its size, scale, bulk, height, depth, width and proximity to the side boundary, in this open prominent position, would result in the closing of an important gap characteristic to the area, resulting in a cramped appearance. The proposal would therefore represent an overdevelopment of the site to the detriment of the visual amenities of the street scene and would fail to either preserve or enhance the character or appearance of the surrounding Rockingham Bridge Conservation Area. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies BE1 and HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 1, DMHB 4, DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), Policy 7.8 of the London Plan (2016) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2019).",
    "The proposed first floor terrace, by reason of its visually prominent position, size and design, would appear as an incongruous form of development that would fail to respect the architectural composition of the original dwelling, and would be harmful to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the street scene and would fail to either preserve or enhance the character or appearance of the surrounding Rockingham Bridge Conservation Area. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies BE1 and HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 1, DMHB 4, DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), Policy 7.8 of the London Plan (2016) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2019).",
    "The proposed rear dormer, by reason of its siting in this visually prominent position, size, scale, bulk, and design, would fail to respect the roof form and architectural composition of the original dwelling, and would be harmful to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the street scene and would fail to either preserve or enhance the character or appearance of the surrounding Rockingham Bridge Conservation Area. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies BE1 and HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 1, DMHB 4, DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), Policy 7.8 of the London Plan (2016) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2019).",
    "The proposed two storey side/rear extension and first floor rear terrace, by virtue of its size, scale, bulk, height and proximity, would have a harmful impact on the living conditions and external amenity space of the occupiers at number 7 Lynch Close, in terms of loss of outlook, sense of enclosure and overbearing effect. The proposal would therefore be contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2019) and Policies DMHB 1 and  DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "The proposed extensions, by virtue of their failure to maintain an adequate amount of private usable external amenity space for the occupiers of the extended property, would result in an over-development of the site detrimental to the residential amenity of existing and future occupiers. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies DMHD 1 and DMHB 18 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan - The Spatial Development Strategy for London consolidated with alterations since 2011 (2016) and national guidance."
