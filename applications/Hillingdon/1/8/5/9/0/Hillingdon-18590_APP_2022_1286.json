    "The proposed extensions, by virtue of their excessive scale, bulk, design, forward projection and proximity to the side boundary, would fail to appear as subordinate additions to the existing semi-detached dwelling or respect the architectural style of the original building. The extensions would be detrimental to the character and appearance of the pair, which share group value, as well as the West Drayton Area of Special Local Character. The development would have an unacceptable visual impact on the streetscene and would fail to comply with Policies BE1 and HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 5, DMHB 11 and DHMD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The proposed side/rear extension, by virtue of its combined scale, depth and bulk, given its siting in close proximity to the boundary shared with 1 Colne Avenue, would result in an unacceptably oppressive and overbearing form of development resulting in a harmful sense of enclosure and loss of outlook, in direct conflict with policies DMHB11 and DMHD1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan - 2020.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "In order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably. In addition further guidance was offered to the applicant by the case officer during the processing of the application to identify the amendments to address those elements of the scheme considered unacceptable which the applicant chose not to implement."
