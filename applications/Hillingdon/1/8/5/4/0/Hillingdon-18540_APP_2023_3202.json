    "The front porch canopy structure by way of its excessive depth appears as an over dominant, insubordinate and a visually discordant addition to the main dwelling which appears out of character within the surrounding area causing less than substantial harm to the Conservation Area without any public benefit. The proposal therefore fails to comply with para 208 of the NPPF (2023), Policies BE1 and HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 4, DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020)."
