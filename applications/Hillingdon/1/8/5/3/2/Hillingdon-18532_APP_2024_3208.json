    "The proposed flat, by virtue of the small internal floor area, poor overall layout, lack of direct outlook for the bedroom and small private outdoor living area, would have a harmful effect upon the living conditions of the future occupants in terms of insufficient habitable space, poor outlook and poor access. Therefore, it would result in an unsatisfactory quality of internal and external residential accommodation for the future occupants of the flat. The proposal would therefore result in a substandard form of residential accommodation to the detriment of the amenity of the future occupiers of the proposed development, contrary to Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 16 and DMHB 18 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020), and Policies D3 and Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2024).",
    "The subdivision of the original dwelling to create the new flat would result in the creation of two units at ground level and the creation of a flat in the area would be contrary to the character of the semi-rural area and surrounding Green Belt context. The proposal is therefore considered to be contrary to policies DMH 1 and DMH 4 of the Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020) and paragraph 135 (f) of the NPPF (2024).",
    "The proposed front porch is poorly designed and represents a discordant addition that is uncharacteristic and not subordinate to the original dwelling and therefore causes harm to the character and appearance of the area and is contrary to Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the adopted Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Polies D3 and D6 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan (2021)."
