    "The development hereby permitted shall be begun before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.",
    "REASON",
    "To comply with Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990.",
    "The development hereby permitted shall not be carried out except in complete accordance with the details shown on the submitted plans, numbers BS-R00-EX-101 Rev. R00, BS-R00-PROP-101 Rev. R00, BS-R01-PROP-103 Rev. R01 received 08-03-23, BS-R02-PROP-108 Rev. R02 received 16-03-2023 and shall thereafter be retained/maintained for as long as the development remains in existence.",
    "REASON",
    "To ensure the development complies with the provisions Hillingdon Local Plan Parts 1 (November 2012) and 2 (January 2020) and the London Plan (2021).",
    "Notwithstanding the approved plans, the outbuilding hereby permitted shall be used only for purposes incidental to the residential use of the No.93 Bury Street, Ruislip and shall remain within the same planning unit. The outbuilding shall at no time be used for purposes such as a living room, bedroom, kitchen or as a separate unit of accommodation.",

    "To avoid any future undesirable fragmentation of the curtilage or the creation of a separate residential use and in the interests of protecting the amenity of adjoining residential properties in accordance with Policy DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan - Part Two (2020).",
    "The decision to GRANT planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to GRANT planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan (2021) and national guidance.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably."
