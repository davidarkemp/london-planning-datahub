    "The proposed roof extension by reason of scale, siting and poor design, would result in an excessive and disproportionate form of development that would obscure the original roof form and dominate the roof of the building. As such, the development would fail to be seen as a subordinate form of development and would have a detrimental impact on the character and appearance of the host property and on the visual amenity of the surrounding residential area. The development would therefore be contrary to Policies D3 & D6 of the London Plan (2021), Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11,DMHB12 and DHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",

    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan - The Spatial Development Strategy for London consolidated with alterations since 2011 (2016) and national guidance."
