  "description": "Single storey front/side rear extension; part single; part two-storey side/rear extension and replacement first floor rear window (following demolition of existing rear extension and side/rear garage addition).",
  "decision_date": "26/01/2023",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed single storey front, part two-storey side/rear extension, by virtue of their excessive scale, cumulative bulk, and incongruous, unsympathetic details of design  would fail to respect the architectural integrity of the original semi-detached dwelling and would result in an incongruous addition which lies within a prominent position in the Garden City, West Drayton Area of Special Local Character (ASLC). The proposal would be contrary to policies BE1 and HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan (November 2012)  and policies DMHB5, DMHB11, DMHB12 and DMHD1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan - Part Two (2020).",
    "The proposed part single storey side/rear extension, by reason of its excessive scale, bulk, rearwards projection and proximity, would result in an overly dominant feature that overshadows the adjoining properties at Nos. 82 and 78 Fairway Avenue  resulting in  overdominance, overshadowing, visual intrusion, loss of light and loss of outlook. and as such would result in a visually intrusive and an un-neighbourly form of development, resulting in a loss of light and material loss of residential amenity. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policies DMHB11 and DMHD1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan - Part Two (2020).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
