    "The proposed extensions, by virtue of their excessive scale, cumulative bulk, and unsympathetic design details, would fail to respect the architectural integrity of the original semi-detached dwelling and would result in an incongruous addition within a prominent position in the Garden City, West Drayton Area of Special Local Character. The proposal would be contrary to Policies BE 1 and HE 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan - Part 1: Strategic Policies (2012) and Policies DMHB 5, DMHB 11, and DMHD 1 of Hillingdon Local Plan - Part 2: Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The proposed extensions, by reason of their excessive scale, bulk, rearwards projection, and proximity, would result in overdominance, overshadowing, visual intrusion, loss of light, and loss of outlook to the neighbouring properties at 82, 78A, and 78B Fairway Avenue. As such, it would result in unacceptable harm to residential amenity. Therefore, the proposal would be contrary to Policies D3 and D6 of the London Plan (2021) and Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan - Part 2: Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The proposed extension would result in a habitable room (TV/meeting room) with inadequate outlook and daylight/sunlight. It would, therefore, give rise to a substandard form of living accommodation to the detriment of the amenity of future occupiers. The proposal is thus contrary to Policies D3 and D6 of the London Plan (2021) and Policy DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan - Part 2: Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service."
