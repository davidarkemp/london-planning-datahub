    "The Beech tree is situated within the front garden of 41a Frithwood Avenue and is highly visible from the main road. As a result it has a Moderate to High amenity value and it significantly contributes to the arboricutural character of the area.",
    "There is a fruiting body present at the base of the tree, however no investigations have been provided as to how this has affected the intergrity of the tree.",
    "Having regard to the reasons given for the proposed work, the work is unjustified and will have a detrimental impact on the visual amenity and arboreal character of the area.",
    "The removal of deadwood, dangerous / hanging branches and ivy:  This does not require the formal consent of the Council.",
    "Expert assessment: There are fungal brackets (fruiting bodies) at the base of the tree. Expert assessment should be made to determine if there is decay present, and if so how extensive it is in terms of the condition, safety and management of the tree."
