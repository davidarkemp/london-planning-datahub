Outside of the breeding season gull activity must be monitored and the roof checked regularly to ensure that gulls do not utilise the roof. Any gulls found nesting, roosting or loafing must be dispersed by the owner/occupier when detected or when requested by Heathrow Airside Operations staff. In some instances, it may be necessary to contact Heathrow Airside Operations staff before bird dispersal takes place. The owner/occupier must remove any nests or eggs found on the roof.
