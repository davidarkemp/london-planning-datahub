    "The Scots Pine is situated within the front garden and has a high amenity value. It has an attractive natural crown and significantly contributes to the arboricultural characteristics of the Copsewood Estate, Northwood an Area of Special Local Character. The benefit in amenity and biodiversity afforded by this tree is both present and future.",
    "The applicants reasons state to control and contain but no evidence has been provided showing why the tree's current crown is out of control and requires containment. Furthermore pruning would unnecessarily introduce large multiple wounds into its crown, which would likely cause stress and lead to infection, affecting its long-term health; this would affect the safe useful life expectancy of the tree. Pruning would also result in weakly attached re-growth forming that would be prone to future failure.",
