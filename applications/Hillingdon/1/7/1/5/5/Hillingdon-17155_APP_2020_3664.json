  "description": "Erection of a four storey building to create two business units and 1 x 2-bed residential unit involving demolition of existing store/garage to rear and remodelling of existing basement to increase business use",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed four storey building, by virtue of its size, scale, bulk, depth and proximity, would be detrimental to the amenities of the adjoining occupiers, by reason of overdominance, overshadowing, visual intrusion, loss of light, loss of outlook and loss of privacy. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to policy DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies.",
    "The proposed four storey building by reason of its siting in this visually prominent position, size, scale, bulk, overall height and design would be an incongruous addition, which would be unduly prominent, overly dominant and out of scale with the character, appearance and visual amenities of the surrounding area and street scene. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), Policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021) and the NPPF.",
    "The proposal, by reason of its design and layout fails to provide a development which meets the requirements of people with disabilities and would therefore give rise to a substandard form of working and living accommodation to the detriment of the amenity of future occupiers. The proposal is thus contrary to Policies D5 and D7 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan - The Spatial Development Strategy for London consolidated with alterations since 2011 (2016) and national guidance.",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2016). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service."
