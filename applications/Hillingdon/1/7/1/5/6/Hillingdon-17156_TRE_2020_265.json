  "description": "To remove One Oak T3 and To lift to 6 metres over neighbours' garden, reduce upper branches over neighbours' garden by up to 30% One Cedar T5 both on TPO 333.",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The Oak tree is situated within the front garden of 7 Church Road, it is highly visible and as a result has a High amenity value. The Cedar is situated within the rear garden but can be seen from the main road. As a result it has a Moderate to High amenity value. Both trees significantly contribute to the Arboricultural character of the area.",
    "The Oak has been a significant landscape feature since before 1984 when the TPO was created. The reasons for removal of the oak are \"as a precaution against root related subsidence damage\" however no evidence has been provided as to why this is now an issue. The Cedar currently has a natural looking canopy, the pruning of one side over the neighbours property will lead to an unnatural lopsided appearance.",
    "Having regard to the reasons given for the proposed work, the work is unjustified and will have a detrimental impact on the visual amenity and arboreal character of the area.",
    "The removal of deadwood, dangerous / hanging branches and ivy:  This does not require the formal consent of the Council."
