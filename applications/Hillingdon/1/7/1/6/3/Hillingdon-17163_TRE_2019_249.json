    "T2 is situated within the rear garden and T4 is situated within the front garden of 3 Buttsmead. Both Oak trees are significant and prominent landscape features to those living in, and visiting, Buttsmead, The Gravel Pits and The Copse Wood Estate. Both Oaks have a high amenity value and significantly contribute to local biodiversity and Area of Special Local Character (Copsewood Estate). They provide a gradual transition of mature tree cover between the dwellings in the copse wood estate and the nearby Ruislip woods National Nature Reserve (NNR). The benefit in amenity and biodiversity afforded by the trees is both present and future because they have the potential for long life expectancies.",
    "The removal of T4 would have a significant and adverse impact on the local environment. The significant crown reduction of 70% to T2 would remove the tree's natural canopy and would unnecessarily introduce large multiple wounds into its crown, which would likely cause stress and lead to infection",
    "The removal of deadwood, dangerous / hanging branches and ivy:  This does not require the formal consent of the Council."
