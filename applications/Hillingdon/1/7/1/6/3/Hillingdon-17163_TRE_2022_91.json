Both Oak trees are significant and prominent landscape features to those living in, and visiting, Buttsmead, The Gravel Pits and The Copse Wood Estate. Both Oaks have a high amenity value and significantly contribute to local biodiversity and Area of Special Local Character (Copsewood Estate).

The benefit in amenity and biodiversity afforded by the trees is both present and future because they have the potential for long life expectancies.",
