    "The proposed development, by reason of its excessive depth, disproportionate scale, size, bulk, massing, and proximity, would cause harm to the residential amenities of the neighbouring property at No. 66 Monmouth Road, by reason of loss of outlook, sense of enclosure and overbearing impact. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One Strategic (2012), Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan - Part Two (2020) and paragraph 130 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The proposal, on account of it's scale, bulk, depth and massing, would be out of scale and fail to harmonise with the host property, to the detriment of the visual amenities of the area and contrary to Policies BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHD 1 and DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020) and Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service. We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
