    "The proposed development, by reason of the size, scale, bulk and design of the rear roof extension, would fail to appear as a subordinate addition and would thus fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original dwelling, would be detrimental to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the street scene and would fail to either preserve or enhance the character or appearance of the surrounding Eastcote Park Estate Conservation Area. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies BE1 and HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 1, DMHB 4, DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), Policy 7.8 of the London Plan (2016) and the NPPF.",
    "The proposed extension, by virtue of its size, scale, bulk and depth would be detrimental to the amenities of the adjoining occupier at 72 Rodney Gardens, by reason of overdominance, overshadowing, visual intrusion, loss of light and loss of outlook. Therefore, the proposal would be contrary to policies DMHD 1 and DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "The proposed development, by reason of the rear raised patio/balcony, would be detrimental to the amenities of the adjoining occupiers at 68 and 72 Rodney Gardens, by reason of loss of privacy and overlooking. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies DMHD 1 and DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020) .",
    "The application fails to demonstrate that the site is safe and flood risk is suitably mitigated through the provision of an appropriate flood risk assessment. The application is therefore contrary to Policy EM6 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policy DMEI 9 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies, Policy 5.12 of the London Plan (2016), the National Planning Policy Framework (March 2012) and Planning Practice Guidance (March 2014).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the 'Saved' UDP 2007, Local Plan Part 1, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.  No pre-application advice was sought.   However the applicant would have been aware of the previous reasons for refusal."
