    "The proposed development, by virtue of its size, scale, bulk, excessive depth and proximity, would be detrimental to the amenities of the adjoining occupiers at 25 St George's Drive, giving rise to a harmful loss of outlook and sense of enclosure to the dwelling and garden area, as well as overshadowing to the primary amenity space in the rear garden. Therefore, the proposal would be contrary to Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and paragraph 130(f) of the NPPF(2021).",
    "Due to its excessive size, scale, bulk and proposed design, the development would form an oversized addition to the dwelling which would harm its architectural composition and appearance. The proposed development is therefore considered to be harmful to both the character and appearance of host dwelling, group value of neighbouring properties and the streetscene of St George's Drive, all contrary to Section 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2023, Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020)."
