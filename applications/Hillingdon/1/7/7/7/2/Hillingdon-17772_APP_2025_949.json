    "The proposed roof extensions, comprising hip to gable features with dormer roof extensions, by reason of their cumulative impact and their size, scale, siting and design, would result in a visually obtrusive and incongruous form of development that would be detrimental to the character and original roof form of the host dwelling. The development would cause a harmful impact on the character and visual amenities of the street scene and context of the site and is therefore contrary to Policies DMHD 1 and DMHB 11 and of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management (2020) and Policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
