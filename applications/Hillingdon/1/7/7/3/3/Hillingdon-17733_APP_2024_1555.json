    "The proposed development given the presence of the flat roof at first floor level, would represent poor design which would not be in keeping with the original dwelling. In addition, the proposed development, by virtue of its bulk, size, scale and overall massing when considered in combination with the existing extensions to the dwelling, would result in alterations to the dwelling that would be visually incongruous, detrimental to the architectural composition of the original property. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2021), Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management (2020).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service."
