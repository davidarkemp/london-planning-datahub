  "description": "Erection of a three storey building with undercroft parking consisting of 3 x 2-bed, 1 x 1-bed and 2 x studio flats with associated parking at ground floor level",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed building, by virtue of its excessive scale, bulk, massing and inappropriate details of design would result in an over dominant structure in comparison to the neighbouring residential dwelling houses, failing to respect the nature and scale of development within the Harmondsworth Village Conservation Area. The development would fail to preserve or enhance the character or appearance of the Conservation Area and would fail to make a positive contribution to local character and distinctiveness. The proposal would therefore be detrimental to the traditional character of the surrounding environment and fails to comply with the NPPF, Policies BE1 and HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan (November 2012) and Policies DMH4, DMHB4; DMHB11 and DMHB12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan:Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The proposal, by reason of its size, bulk, design and proximity, with inadequate separation distances between the proposed dwellings and the existing properties in Duval House, would result in an overly dominant, visually intrusive and an un-neighbourly form of development, resulting in a material loss of residential amenity for adjoining occupiers at Duval House.  The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies DMH4 and DMHB11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan:Part Two - Developement Management Policies (2020).",
    "The proposed development by reason of its siting and proximity to the adjacent properties at Nos.1 and 2 Meadowlea Close and Nos.10, 11 and 12 Acacia Mews and the rear facing flats in Duval House would result in a material loss of residential amenity to those properties due to the layout of the proposed front, side and rear facing windows and the side and rear facing balconies resulting in an actual or perceived sense of overlooking. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies DMH4 and DMHB11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan:Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The proposal fails to provide amenity space of sufficient size and quality commensurate to the size and layout of the said units and would result in an overdevelopment of the site detrimental to the residential amenity of existing and future occupiers of the development. As such the proposal would provide a substandard form of accommodation for future residents contrary to Policies DMHB11 and DMHB18 of the Hillingdon Local Plan:  Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The design of the building is incompatible with London Plan policy 3.8 (c) as step free and accessible and adaptable dwellings could not be successfully delivered.",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan - The Spatial Development Strategy for London consolidated with alterations since 2011 (2016) and national guidance.",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2016). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal.",
    "This is a reminder that Under the terms of the Planning Act 2008 (as amended) and Community Infrastructure Levy Regulations 2010 (as amended), should an application for appeal be allowed, the proposed development would be deemed as 'chargeable development' and therefore liable to pay the London Borough of Hillingdon Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and the Mayor of London's Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This would be calculated in accordance with the London Borough of Hillingdon CIL Charging Schedule 2014 and the Mayor of London's CIL Charging Schedule 2012.
