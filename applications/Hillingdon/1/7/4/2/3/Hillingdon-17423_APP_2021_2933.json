    "The proposed single storey rear extension, by reason of its cumulative size, design and proximity to the shared boundary, would result in an overly dominant feature that is incongruous with the prevailing pattern of development, resulting in harm to the character of the area, and would harm the residential amenity of the adjoining property at No.20 Pavilion Way, through loss of light to and outlook from this property, and through creating an overbearing sense of enclosure. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to policies DMHB11 and DMHD1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan - Part Two (2020).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service."
