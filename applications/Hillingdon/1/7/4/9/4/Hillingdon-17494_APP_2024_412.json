    "The proposed development (including roof conversion and front porch), by reason of their size, scale, bulk and appearance, would be unduly prominent, visually incongruous and unsympathetic to the original architectural composition of the host dwelling, resulting in a detrimental impact on the character and appearance of the original dwelling, and would be out of keeping with the character and appearance of the immediate street scene and the surrounding area. The proposal thereby fails to comply with Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One- Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), Policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (March 2021) and Chapter 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework (December 2023).",
