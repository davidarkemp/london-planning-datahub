  "description": "Erection of four terraced dwellings incorporating landscaping, parking provision, waste and cycle stores",
  "decision_date": "25/01/2023",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed development, by reason of the number of dwellings being proposed, their terraced form, layout and siting, would result in an incongruous form of overdevelopment of the site that would fail to harmonise with the existing local context and prevailing pattern of development on Beacon Close. The principle of intensifying the residential use of the site as proposed, would have a detrimental impact on the street scene and character and appearance of the area as a whole. The proposal is therefore detrimental to the visual amenity and character of the surrounding area and contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012), Policies DMH 6, DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the adopted Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The proposed development, by reason of its forward projection beyond the established front building line in this section of Beacon Close, plot width, depth, massing, bulk, scale and design, including the uncharacteristically steep roof pitch and unduly monotonous appearance, would fail to harmonise with the character and architectural composition of surrounding properties, appearing as an awkward, incongruous and cramped form of development which would be detrimental to the visual amenity of the street scene and harmful to the character and appearance of the surrounding area. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012), Policies DMH 6, DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the adopted Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies ( 2020), Policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The proposed development, by virtue of the excessive area of hard standing for the on-site parking provision, negligible soft landscaping, removal of the existing front boundary treatment and forward position of the visually obtrusive bin stores, would erode and be out of keeping with the existing pleasant, spacious and suburban character of the site and the surrounding street scene on Beacon Close. The proposal would therefore have a harmful impact upon the character, appearance and visual amenities of the area, contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012), Policies DMH 6, DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the adopted Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The proposed development, by virtue of the loss of an existing large tree at the site and in the absence of an Arboricultural Report to the British Standard 5837:2021, would cause harm to the open and verdant character and appearance of the site and would introduce an urbanising form of development that would not integrate well with its surroundings. The proposed replacement trees would not mitigate the harm caused to the character and appearance of the area. The proposal would therefore conflict with Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012), Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHB 14 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2- Development Management Policies (2020), Policies D3, D4 and G7 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "In the absence of a legal agreement to cover the required highways work to enable the proposed vehicle crossovers and on-site car parking provision and preventing the issuing of parking permits to future occupiers of the proposed dwellings which are located within a permit-controlled area, the proposed development is likely to lead to an increase in pressure for on-street parking and have a consequent adverse effect on highway safety, through inconsiderate and potential hazardous parking and a risk to road users. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policy DMT 1, DMT 2 and DMT 6 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020), Policies T4, T6 and T6.1 of the London Plan (2021) and paragraph 111 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The proposed development, by virtue of its constrained site layout, internal design of the buildings, and absence of details to show that the internal layout would comply with Approved Document M of Building Regulation requirement M4(2) and M4(3), fails to demonstrate that adequate provision would be made to meet the needs of people with disabilities. The proposed development therefore conflicts with Policies D5 and D7 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "In the absence of a preliminary ecology report, there is insufficient information to demonstrate that the proposed development, which would involve the demolition of the existing dwelling at the site, would not cause any harm to protected species (which includes bats).  The proposal therefore fails to demonstrate that no harm would be caused to protected species and their habitats, contrary to Policy G6 of the London Plan (2021), Policy DMEI 7 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "Insufficient evidence has been provided to demonstrate that secure, sheltered, well-located and accessible short stay and long stay cycle store parking spaces can be provided for future occupiers of the proposed development without adversely impacting upon the character and appearance of the area. This issue is further exacerbated by the constrained nature of the site. The proposal would therefore fail to facilitate and encourage cycling as a sustainable mode of transport contrary to Policy DMT 5 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020) and Policy T5 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan (2021) and national guidance.",
    "This is a reminder that Under the terms of the Planning Act 2008 (as amended) and Community Infrastructure Levy Regulations 2010 (as amended), should an application for appeal be allowed, the proposed development would be deemed as 'chargeable development' and therefore liable to pay the London Borough of Hillingdon Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and the Mayor of London's Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This would be calculated in accordance with the London Borough of Hillingdon CIL Charging Schedule 2014 and the Mayor of London's CIL Charging Schedule 2012.",
