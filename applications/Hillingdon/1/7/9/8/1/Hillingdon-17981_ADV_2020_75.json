    "The proposed signs, by reason of their height, design and proliferation, would represent inappropriate development within the Green Belt and no very special circumstances have been provided or are evident which either singularly or cumulatively overcome the presumption against inappropriate development in the Green Belt. The proposal would harm the openness of the Green Belt. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies BE1 and EM2 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012). Policies DMHB 13A and DMEI 4 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy G2 of the London Plan (2021) and the NPPF.",
