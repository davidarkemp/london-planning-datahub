    "The site lies in a Critical Drainage Area (CDA) as identified in the Surface Water Management Plan (SWMP) for Hillingdon. A CDA is the catchment area from which surface water drains and contributes to drainage problems. All developments in this area must contribute to managing the risk of flooding from surface water by reducing surface water runoff from the site. Therefore the applicant should minimise the water from your site entering the sewers. No drainage to support the extension should be connected to any existing surface water sewer, other than as an overflow. Water run off from any roof or hard paving associated with  the development should be directed to a soakaway, or tank or made permeable. This includes any work to front gardens not part of the planning application, which must be permeable or be collected and directed to a permeable area, otherwise it would need an additional permission. A water butt should be incorporated.",
    "The proposed plan does not currently include any toilet facilities for disabled people and at least one accessible unisex toilet should be provided, as new facilities would be constructed. Should it not be possible to provide an accessible cubicle within each of the changing rooms, it would be acceptable to provide a single accessible toilet within the referee changing area. The accessible toilet(s) should be designed in accordance with the guidance given in Approved Document M to the Building Regulations 2010 (2015 edition).",
