    "The proposed development by reason of its size, scale, width, height and design would result in an incongruous, dominant, disproportionate, bulky and visually intrusive addition that would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original dwelling, breach neighbouring building lines and would subsequently be detrimental to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
