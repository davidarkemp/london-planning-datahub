    "Due to its depth, bulk, scale, massing, design and siting, the proposed building would form an oversized, uncharacteristic and visually incongruous form of development, which would fail to harmonise with the established character and appearance of the street scene and other backland/garden development in the vincinity. The proposal would therefore be detrimental to the visual amenities of the streetscene and character of the surrounding area, all contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012), Policies DMHB 11, and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policies D1 and D3 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "Due to its depth, size, siting and design, the proposed building would be overbearing and would lead to a harmful sense of enclosure and loss of outlook from the rear windows and gardens of 1 and 2 Newlyn Close, as well as significant overlooking and a harmful loss of privacy to the occupiers of 1, 2, 3 Newlyn Close, properties on Pield Heath Road and 2 Micawber Road. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policy DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and paragraph 130 (f) of the NPPF (2021).",
    "The proposed development fails to provide any three or more bedroom (family sized) units. Robust justification has not been provided to demonstrate that the provision of family sized units would be unsuitable or unviable. The proposal therefore fails to optimise the site and provide a suitable mix of housing to support sustainable, inclusive and mixed communities, contrary to Policy DMH 2 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy H10 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "No legal agreement is in place to prohibit future residents of the proposed development from applying to join the Council's on street parking management scheme. In the absence of such an agreement, the Council's Parking Management Scheme is likely to be overutilised, leading to roadside parking, congestion and reduced highway safety. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policy DMT 2 and DMT 6 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and Policy T4 and T6 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "The proposed vehicular access would create a hazardous and dangerous environment for pedestrians crossing the site and drivers leaving the site. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policy DMT 2 and DMT 6 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy T4 and T6 of the London Plan (2021) and The London Borough of Hillingdon Domestic Vehicle Footway Crossover Policy 2022.",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan (2021) and national guidance.",
    "This is a reminder that Under the terms of the Planning Act 2008 (as amended) and Community Infrastructure Levy Regulations 2010 (as amended), should an application for appeal be allowed, the proposed development would be deemed as 'chargeable development' and therefore liable to pay the London Borough of Hillingdon Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and the Mayor of London's Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This would be calculated in accordance with the London Borough of Hillingdon CIL Charging Schedule 2014 and the Mayor of London's CIL Charging Schedule 2012.",
