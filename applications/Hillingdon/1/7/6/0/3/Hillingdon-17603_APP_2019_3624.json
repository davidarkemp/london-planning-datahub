    "The proposed two storey rear extension by virtue of its design including the relationship between the roof of the first floor rear extension and the rear dormer roof extension would result in a visually intrusive and incongruous addition which would be detrimental to the architectural composition of the existing building and the character, appearance and visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policies DMHB11 and DMHD1 of the Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",

    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Unitary Development Plan Saved Policies (September 2007) as incorporated into the Hillingdon Local Plan (2012) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan - The Spatial Development Strategy for London consolidated with alterations since 2011 (2016) and national guidance."
