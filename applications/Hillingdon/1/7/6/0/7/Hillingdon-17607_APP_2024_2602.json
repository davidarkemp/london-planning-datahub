    "The development, by reason of its siting, size, bulk and design would result in a cramped, contrived and visually incongruous form of development that would fail to harmonise with the existing context of the surrounding area. The development as proposed would be detrimental to the character, established pattern of development, appearance and visual amenity of the site and surrounding area. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012), Policies DMH 6, DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHB 14 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021) and Paragraphs 128d) and 135b) of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023).",
    "Due to its location, access, proposed parking arrangement and cycle storage location, the proposed development would lead to cars reversing onto Newlyn Close, which would reduce pedestrian, cyclist and road user safety whilst also leading to traffic build up on the local highways network. The proposal would therefore result in a more dangerous highways network, contrary to Policies DMT 1, DMT 2, DMT 5 and DMT 6 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), as well as policies T2, T4 and T6 of the London Plan (2021) and paragraph 115 and 116 of the NPPF (2023).",
    "In the absence of sufficient biodiversity net gain information, it has not been demonstrated that the proposal would deliver at least a 10% increase in biodiversity value relative to the pre-development biodiversity value of the onsite habitat. As the proposed development fails to provide an appropriate biodiversity net gain, it is contrary to Schedule 7A of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as inserted by Schedule 14 of the Environment Act 2021), Policy G6 of the London Plan (2021), Policy EM7 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012), and Policy DMEI 7 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two (2020).",
    "In the absence of an Arboricutural Survey the applicant has failed to provide adequate information regarding the value of the existing trees on site and that they will be protected during the construction of the development. Accordingly, the development would result in adverse and irreversible impacts to landscaping, trees, biodiversity or other natural features of merit, detrimental to the visual amenities of the area, contrary to paragraph 136 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023), Policy G7 of the London Plan (2021), and Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHB 14 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 (2020).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan (2021) and NPPF (2023).",
    "This is a reminder that Under the terms of the Planning Act 2008 (as amended) and Community Infrastructure Levy Regulations 2010 (as amended), should an application for appeal be allowed, the proposed development would be deemed as 'chargeable development' and therefore liable to pay the London Borough of Hillingdon Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and the Mayor of London's Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This would be calculated in accordance with the London Borough of Hillingdon CIL Charging Schedule 2014 and the Mayor of London's CIL Charging Schedule 2012.",
