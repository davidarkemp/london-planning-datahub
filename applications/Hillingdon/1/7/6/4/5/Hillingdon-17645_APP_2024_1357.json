    "The proposal by reason of its size, scale, siting and design would represent an incongruous and insubordinate addition, failing to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original dwelling and would result in an over development of the site which fails to read as a subordinate addition to the host property, harming the original design and appearance of the host property, detrimental to the character and appearance of the surrounding area and fails to comply with Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHD 1, DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021) and Chapter 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023).",
    "As the property will gain two additional bedrooms, resulting in a four-bedroom house. The proposed block plan indicates that 67sqm of external amenity space will be available of which falls below the recommended provisions set out Policy DMHB 18 which states in Table 5.3: Private Outdoor Amenity Space Standards that a 4 bedroom house should have at least 100sqm of private outdoor amenity space. The proposal would undermine the provision of external amenity space for the existing occupiers at the application site and is therefore contrary to Policies DMHD 1 and DMHB 18 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020)."
