    "By virtue of its design, size, bulk, scale, siting and loss of front soft landscaping, the proposal would cumulatively result in an insubordinate and visually incongruous, cramped form of development that would be detrimental to the character and appearance of the original property, surrounding area and West Drayton Green Conservation Area. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy BE1 and HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2021), Policies DMHB 4, DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management (2020), Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021) and Chapter 12 and 16 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023).",
    "In the absence of an Arboricutural Survey the applicant has failed to provide adequate information regarding the value of the existing trees on site and that they will be protected during the construction of the development. Accordingly, the development would result in adverse and irreversible impacts to landscaping, trees, biodiversity or other natural features of merit, detrimental to the visual amenities of the area and West Drayton Green Conservation Area, contrary to paragraph 136 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023), Policy G7 of the London Plan (2021), and Policies DMHB 4, DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHB 14 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 (2020).",
    "The development, by virtue of its failure to maintain an adequate provision of private external amenity space, would have a harmful effect on the living conditions of the current and future occupants of the dwelling. The development is therefore contrary to Policy DMHB 18 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and Paragraph 135f of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023).",
    "The proposed development would have an over provision of car parking spaces and fail to provide safe and acceptable vehicle access which would prejudice highway safety. The development is therefore contrary to Policies DMT 1, DMT 2 and DMT 6 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policies T2, T4, T6 and T6.1 of the London Plan (2021) and Paragraph 115 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service."
