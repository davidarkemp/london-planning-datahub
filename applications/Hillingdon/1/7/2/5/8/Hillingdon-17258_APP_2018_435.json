  "description": "Removal of plasticised coating to brickwork applied in 1980's and replacement with appropriate exterior appearance and coatings (Retrospective) (Application for Listed Building Consent)",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposal, by reason of leaving the brickwork exposed, would cause harm to the building envelope, dramatically altering the appearance of the Grade II Listed Building and have a detrimental impact on the Eastcote Village Conservation Area, contrary to Policies BE1 and HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 1, DMHB 2, DMHB 4, DMHB 11 and  of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), Policy HC1 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2019).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Unitary Development Plan Saved Policies (September 2007) as incorporated into the Hillingdon Local Plan (2012) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan - The Spatial Development Strategy for London consolidated with alterations since 2011 (2016) and national guidance.",
    "A detailed analysis of the condition of the brickwork should be undertaken by a specialist contractor, to establish the age and condition of brickwork, and to make a sensible judgement about whether a shelter coat of limewash would be beneficial, both aesthetically and, more importantly, for the future security of the fabric."
