  "description": "Addition of a second floor for use as storage",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed development, by reason of its size, scale, bulk, design in particular the roof profile(s) would fail to appear as subordinate additions and would result in incongruous additions which would be detrimental to the architectural composition of the original building, the visual amenities of the street scene and the character and appearance of the wider Area. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies BE13, BE15 and BE19 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Saved UDP Policies (November 2012) and Policy DMHB 11 of the emerging Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies with Modifications (March 2019).",
    "The proposed building by virtue of its size, scale, bulk, height and proximity, would be detrimental to the amenities of the adjoining occupiers by reason of loss of daylight/sunlight, visual intrusion, overdominance, loss of outlook and loss of privacy. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policies BE20, BE21 and BE24 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Saved UDP Policies (November 2012) and Policy DMHB 11 of the emerging Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies with Modifications (March 2019).",
    "In the absence of an appraisal relating to parking demand and vehicular activity linked to the proposal, the application fails to demonstrate that the scheme would not result in harm to the local highway network and is therefore considered contrary to Policies AM2, AM7 and AM14 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Unitary Development Plan Saved Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMT1, DMT2 and DMT6 of the emerging Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies with Modifications (March 2019).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the 'Saved' UDP 2007, Local Plan Part 1, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service."
