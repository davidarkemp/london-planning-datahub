  "decision_conditions": [
    "The first floor front extension, by reason of its size, scale, bulk and design represents a discordant and incongruous addition which fails to appear in keeping with the character and proportions of the original dwellinghouse and is detrimental to the visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area.  Therefore the proposal is contrary to Policy BE 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11, DMHD 1 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service."
