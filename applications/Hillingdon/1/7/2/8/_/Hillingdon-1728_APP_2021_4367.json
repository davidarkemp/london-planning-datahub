    "The proposed development, by reason of its siting, size, scale, bulk, massing height, external finish and design (including uncharacteristic front undercroft, balconies, terraces and inadequate soft landscaping treatment) would result in a cramped, incongruous and visually obtrusive form of development. The proposal would therefore cause significant harm to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One- Strategic Policies (2021), Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHB 14 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2- Development Management Policies (2020), Policies D1, D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The proposed development, by virtue of the front undercroft feature, position of the front car parking spaces, the uninviting entrance to the proposed retail unit, the absence of any designated space for signage for the proposed retail unit, and the lack of soft landscaping treatment opportunity, would result in a dead ground floor frontage. As a consequence, the proposed development would have a detrimental impact to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area, which includes the local shopping parade the site forms a part of. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One- Strategic Policies (2021), Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHB 14 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2- Development Management Policies (2020), Policies D1, D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The proposed development, by virtue of its siting, size, scale, bulk, height, design and inclusion of balconies, terraces and a communal roof terrace, would cause harm to the living conditions of neighbouring residential occupiers,  in terms of loss of outlook, overbearing impact, sense of enclosure, perceived and actual loss of privacy, noise and disturbance.  The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One- Strategic Policies (2012), Policy DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The proposed development fails to provide an adequate housing mix due to the absence of any inclusion of one and two bedroom units. Robust justification has not been provided to demonstrate that one and two bedrooms units would be unsuitable or unviable. The proposal would therefore not provide a suitable mix of housing to support sustainable, inclusive and mixed communities contrary to Policy DMH 2 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2- Development Management Policies (2020), Policy H2 and H10 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The proposed development does not achieve the site's full potential due to the unacceptable housing mix comprising four x four-bedroom flats. As a result, the  proposal fails to make efficient use of land, and fails to deliver an amount of housing and type that would sufficiently contribute to meeting the Borough's housing supply. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies DMH 2 and DMHB 17 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020),  Policies H1, H2, H10, GG2, GG4 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The proposed development, by virtue of the site layout, access arrangements (including the lack of natural surveillance) and the private service road leading to the rear of the site falls outside of the site curtilage (i.e. the red line boundary), would provide substandard living environment for future occupiers, in terms of poor access, safety and security. The proposal therefore conflicts with Policies DMHB 15 and DMHB 16 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020), Policies D6 and D11 of the London Plan (2021) and the NPPF (2021).",
    "The proposed development, by reason of its inadequate size of the proposed balconies, quality and functionality of the private external amenity space provision, the communal open plan siting/dining room at roof level and the communal roof terrace, would result in substandard forms of residential accommodation to the detriment of future occupants. The proposal therefore conflicts with Policy DMHB 18 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "It has not been demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority that the on-site car parking provision serving the proposed flats could be realistically and feasibly delivered given that the private service road leading to the rear of the site falls outside of the site curtilage (i.e. the red line boundary). In the absence of on-site car parking provision, the proposal would cause unacceptable street parking stress, which in turn, would lead to highway safety issues. The proposal therefore conflicts with Policies DMT1, DMT 2 and DMT 6 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2- Development Management Policies (2020), Policies T6 and T6.1 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "It has not been demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority that the on-site cycle parking provision serving the proposed flats could be realistically and feasibly delivered given that the private service road leading to the rear of the site falls outside of the site curtilage (i.e. the red line boundary). In the absence of on-site cycle parking provision, the proposal would fail to facilitate and encourage cycling as a sustainable mode of transport. The proposal therefore conflicts with Policies DMT5 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2- Development Management Policies (2020), Policy T5 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "In the absence of sufficient information, and noting that the the private service road leading to the rear of the site falls outside of the site curtilage (i.e. the red line boundary), the proposed development fails to demonstrate that larger delivery and refuse vehicles would be able to service the site without causing harm to highway safety. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policies DMT 1 and DMT 2 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2- Development Management Policies (2020), Policy T6 of the London Plan (2021) and the  National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "In the absence of the private service road leading to the site falling outside of the application site curtilage (i.e. the red line boundary), the proposal fails to sufficiently demonstrate how the development would achieve the highest standards of fire safety in regard to its design in incorporating appropriate features which reduce the risk to life in the event of a fire, its construction methods, means of escape, strategy for evacuation and providing suitable access and equipment for firefighting appropriate for the size and residential nature of the development. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies D5 and D12 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The proposed development, by virtue of the access arrangements to the proposed flats via the private service road which falls outside of the application site curtilage (i.e. the red line boundary), the absence of details to show that the internal layout would comply with Building Regulation requirement M4(2) and M4(3), fails to demonstrate that adequate provision would be provided to meet the needs of people with disabilities. The proposed development therefore conflicts with Policies D5 and D7 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The proposed development, by virtue of the position of the entrance door to the proposed retail unit, the limited width of the walkway leading to the proposed retail unit, and the number of car parking spaces sited along the site frontage, would not be of an inclusive design for people with disabilities, wheelchair users and people with pushchairs. The proposed development therefore conflicts with Policies D5 and D7 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "In the absence legal agreement, the proposed development fails to secure the necessary financial contribution to help reduce evaluate and reduce emissions and exposure to poor air quality within the locality, given that the site is designated within an Air Quality Management Area. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies DMEI14 and DMCI 7 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy SI 1 of the London Plan (2021), the Hillingdon Air Quality Action Plan (2019) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021)."
