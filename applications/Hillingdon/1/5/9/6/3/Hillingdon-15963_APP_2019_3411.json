    "The proposed residential development represents inappropriate development within the Green Belt in terms of the guidance contained in the National Planning Policy Framework which is harmful by definition to its open character and appearance. Furthermore, there are no very special circumstances provided or which are evident which either singularly or cumulatively justify the development which would overcome the presumption against inappropriate development in the Green Belt. The development is therefore harmful to the Green Belt, contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework, Policy 7.16 of the London Plan (2016),  Policy OL1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Saved UDP Policies (November 2012) and emerging Policy DMEI 4: Development in the Green Belt or on Metropolitan Open Land of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies with Modifications (March 2019).",

    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Unitary Development Plan Saved Policies (September 2007) as incorporated into the Hillingdon Local Plan (2012) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan - The Spatial Development Strategy for London consolidated with alterations since 2011 (2016) and national guidance."
