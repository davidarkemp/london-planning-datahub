    "The works hereby permitted shall not be carried out except in complete accordance with the details shown on the submitted plans titled Location Plan, Block Plan, Page 1 Photograph of Existing Shopfront and Page 2 (1.7_Lucky Seven Barbers) and shall thereafter be retained/maintained for as long as the works remain in existence.",

    "The development hereby approved shall be carried out strictly in accordance with the materials, external surfaces and colours specified on the approved plan titled Page 2 (1.7__Lucky Seven Barbers) and be retained as such thereafter.",

    "The decision to GRANT Listed Building Consent has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to GRANT Listed Building Consent has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan (2021) and national guidance."
