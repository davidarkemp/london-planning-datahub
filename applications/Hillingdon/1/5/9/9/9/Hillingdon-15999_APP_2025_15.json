    "The proposed side/rear extension, by reason of its scale, height, massing and design would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original dwelling to the detriment of its character and appearance. The extension would also unbalance the visual symmetry that exists between the host dwelling and the adjoining neighbour No.109 Central Avenue, causing harm to the character and appearance of the Central Avenue Area of Special Local Character and the visual amenities of the street scene. The development would therefore be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One (2012), Policies DMHB 5, DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan - Part Two (2020) and Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "The proposed development, by virtue of its failure to maintain an adequate provision of private external amenity space, would have a harmful effect on the living conditions of the occupants of the host property. The development would therefore be contrary to Policies DMHB 16, DMHB 18 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan - Part Two (2020) and Paragraph 135f) of the National Planning Policy Framework (2024).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2021). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
