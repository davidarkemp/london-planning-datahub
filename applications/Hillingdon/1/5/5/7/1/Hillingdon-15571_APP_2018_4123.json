  "description": "Two storey building to provide 5 x 1-bed and 2 x 2-bed self-contained flats with associated parking, cycle store and amenity space",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed development would result in the over-concentration of flatted development on this part of Swakeleys Road, an over- intensification of the residential use and by reason of the proximity of the building to the side boundaries, a cramped form of development and appearance to the site which would be detrimental to the traditional character associated with detached family housing that has been retained on this section of Swakeleys Road. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies BE13 and BE19 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Saved UDP Policies (November 2012), Policy DMH 4 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies with Modifications (March 2019) and Paragraph 3.3 of the Council's adopted Supplementary Planning Document HDAS: Residential Layouts.",
    "The proposed bin store, by reason of its size, scale and siting, would appear as an unduly intrusive and conspicuous structure, detrimental to the visual amenities of the street scene, contrary to Policies BE13 and BE19 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Saved UDP Policies (November 2012).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant saved policies (referred to as policies from the Hillingdon Unitary Development Plan - Saved Policies September 2007), then London Plan Policies (2016). On the 8th November 2012 Hillingdon's Full Council agreed the adoption of the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies. Appendix 5 of this explains which saved policies from the old Unitary Development (which was subject to a direction from Secretary of State in September 2007 agreeing that the policies were 'saved') still apply for development control decisions.",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Unitary Development Plan Saved Policies (September 2007) as incorporated into the Hillingdon Local Plan (2012) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan - The Spatial Development Strategy for London consolidated with alterations since 2011 (2016) and national guidance.",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. The Council's supports pre-application discussions in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably. A pre-application submission was made in this case. Whilst some changes were made as a result this did not overcome the fundamental objections and some detailed matters reflected in the reasons for refusal.",
    "This is a reminder that Under the terms of the Planning Act 2008 (as amended) and Community Infrastructure Levy Regulations 2010 (as amended), should an application for appeal be allowed, the proposed development would be deemed as 'chargeable development' and therefore liable to pay the London Borough of Hillingdon Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and the Mayor of London's Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This would be calculated in accordance with the London Borough of Hillingdon CIL Charging Schedule 2014 and the Mayor of London's CIL Charging Schedule 2012.
