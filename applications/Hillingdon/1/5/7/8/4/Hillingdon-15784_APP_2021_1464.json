    "The proposal, by reason of the close proximity and position of the proposed crossover, has failed to demonstrate that the development will safeguard and protect the existing street tree and ensure its long-term retention. The proposal would, thus, result in harm to and potential loss of the tree to the detriment of the character and appearance of the street scene and the wider area contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 (2012) and Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12, DMHB 14 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 (2020).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service. We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
