    "To crown reduce to previous points One Ash T7 on TPO 73",
    "To remove One Ash T7 on TPO 73",
    "The Ash is situated within the front garden of 11 Church Close, it significantly contributes to the arboricultural character of the local Conservation area and provides a gradual transition from the Mature trees with The Closes Recreation Ground and residential properties. It has a high amenity value.",
    "The applicant believes the Ash tree's size is inappropriate for the location however there is a history of periodic crown reductions to ensure the canopy is not overbearing within the street and as a result I do not agree this is a reason for tree removal. Bird and leaf fall issues are not seen as reasons for tree removal. The last crown reduction was approved in 2016, the canopy has fully recovered since then and as a result a further crown reduction is seen as appropriate.",
    "Having regard to the reasons given to remove the TPO Ash, the work is unjustified and will have a detrimental impact on the visual amenity and arboreal character of the area. Having regard to the Crown reduction,",
    "The tree to be pruned shall be crown reduced by cutting back to 25-50 mm beyond previous points. Crown reduction shall not be construed as 'lopping' or 'topping' and shall result in a tree of typical form for the species and of balanced appearance.",
    "The previous pruning points / pollard heads shall be left intact and an appropriate number of live branches (which can be shortened) shall be left so that a natural-looking crown results.",
    "The works shall be carried out in accordance with the recommendations contained in BS 3998:2010 'Tree work - Recommendations'. Climbing irons or 'spikes' shall not be used during the execution of the work.",
    "REASON",
    "In order to protect health of the tree and the visual amenity of the area.",
    "The removal of deadwood, dangerous / hanging branches and ivy:  This does not require the formal consent of the Council.",
    "Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981:  Note that it is an offence under this act to disturb roosting bats, nesting birds or any other protected species.  Therefore, if applicable, it is advisable to consult your tree surgeon / consultant to agree an acceptable time for carrying out the approved works.",
    "Refusal of part of the requested works: The applicant retains a right of appeal against the part of the application that has effectively been refused (i.e. To remove One Ash)."
