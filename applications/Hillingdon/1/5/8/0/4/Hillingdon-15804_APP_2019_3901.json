  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed two storey rear extension, by reason of its siting in this visually prominent position, size, scale, bulk and roof design would fail to appear as a subordinate addition and would would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original dwelling, to the detriment of the character, appearance and visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policies DMHD 1, DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service. No pre-application advice was sought. However the applicant would have been aware of the previous reasons for refusal."
