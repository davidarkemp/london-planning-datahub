    "The proposal would be harmful due to the cluttering of the elevations and disrupting of notable architectural features, in particular the cornice and would not respect the significance of the building and would alter its character and appearance in a detrimental way. There would also be harm to the historic fabric with the fixings and the openings, and no information or floor plans have been provided to demonstrate that there would be no harm to the internal fabric of this statutorily listed building. Therefore the proposal would fail to preserve the significance of the Grade II Listed Building by posing 'less than substantial harm' to the significance of the designated heritage asset, and adversely affect the visual amenity of the street scene and character of the area. Further, the proposed development would not deliver public benefits sufficient to outweigh the harm posed. As such, the proposal is contrary to Policies BE1 and HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 (2012), Policies",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "In order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably. In addition further guidance was offered to the applicant by the case officer during the processing of the application to identify the amendments to address those elements of the scheme considered unacceptable which the applicant chose not to implement."
