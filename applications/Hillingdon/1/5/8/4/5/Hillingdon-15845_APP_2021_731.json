  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposal by reason of the location of the additional vehicular crossover would result in a significant incursion into the root protection area of, and direct threat to the health and well-being of the protected Oak tree. The proposal therefore would fail to preserve the long term health and vitality of the protected Oak tree which is of high visual amenity value. The proposal is therefore detrimental to the visual amenity of the street scene and the wider Copse Wood Estate Area of Special Local Character contrary to Policies BE1 and HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 1, DMHB 5, DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHB 14 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy HC1 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2019).",
    "The proposal, by reason of the positioning of the second crossover would be detrimental to highway and pedestrian safety contrary to Policies DMT 1 and DMT2 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan - The Spatial Development Strategy for London consolidated with alterations since 2011 (2016) and national guidance.",
