  "description": "To carry out tree surgery including a crown reduction by 25% to One Oak (T1 on application) and fell one Thuja (T3 on application) both within Area 1 on TPO 392",
  "application_type": "All Other",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "To carry out tree surgery including a crown reduction by 25% to One Oak (T1 on application) within Area 1 on TPO 392",
    "The Oak tree is situated in the front garden of 23 Linksway and can be seen along the road, The tree does not appear to have been pruned before and has an attractive, natural-looking crown typical of its species. Along with other nearby trees the Oak helps to provide a gradual transition of mature tree cover between the dwellings in Copsewood Way and the nearby Ruislip woods National Nature Reserve (NNR).",
    "The tree contributes to local biodiversity, and significantly contributes to the amenity and arboreal / wooded character of the Copsewood Estate Area of Special Local Character. The Oak tree has a high amenity value. The Thuja is situated within the rear garden, the top of the canopy can be seen over the building but is in poor health. As a result, the Thuja has a low amenity value.",
    "It is agreed that the Thuja is in decline. Its proximity to the property makes it appropriate to remove and replace. Having regard to the proposed (allowed) works, this will not have a detrimental impact o",
    "To fell one Thuja (T3 on application) within Area 1 on TPO 392",
    "No felling shall take place until such time as a scheme has been submitted to, and approved in writing by, the Local Planning Authority for a replacement tree(s), which shall be of 'Standard' size (about 2-3m high) and short-staked for support. The replacement tree shall be planted during the first planting season following the felling works hereby permitted. Thereafter, the replacement tree(s) shall be retained indefinitely and maintained (watered and weeded during the spring and summer) for 2-3 years, or until established.",
    "REASON",
    "In order to comply with the requirements of Section 206 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990.",
    "The removal of deadwood, dangerous / hanging branches and ivy:  This does not require the formal consent of the Council.",
    "Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981:  Note that it is an offence under this act to disturb roosting bats, nesting birds or any other protected species.  Therefore, if applicable, it is advisable to consult your tree surgeon / consultant to agree an acceptable time for carrying out the approved works.",
    "Stump removal: After felling, tree stumps are frequently colonised by honey fungus (Armillaria sp.) which is known to spread and colonise nearby trees. Some trees and woody plants can often be killed by honey fungus and, therefore, it is advisable to remove the tree stump and roots as soon as possible after felling."
