    "Cumulatively, the proposed first floor side extension, in conjunction with existing extensions and conversions, by reason of its design, size, scale and bulk, would result in an incongruous form of development that would not appear as a subordinate addition to the original dwellinghouse and would be detrimental to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the street scene and surrounding area. The proposed development would also be an over development of the site.  The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHD 1, DMHB 1, DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021) and Chapter 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The proposed development, by reason of the increased number of bedrooms would result in inadequate private amenity space provisions. This would be detrimental to the amenity of the current and any future occupiers of 57 Warley Road, and would give rise to a substandard form of accommodation. As such, the proposal would be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One Strategic Policies (2012), Policies DMHD 1 and  DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and Chapter 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021)."
