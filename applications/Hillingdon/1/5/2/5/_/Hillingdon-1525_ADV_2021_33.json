It is also considered that the fascia signs and projecting sign would fail to preserve or enhance the significance, character or appearance of a Grade II Listed Building (Black Horse Public House) and the Grade II Listed K6 telephone kiosk and would be detrimental to the significance of designated heritage assets which are located within the immediate vicinity of the site. The proposal would therefore conflict with Policies BE1 and HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 1, DMHB 2, DMHB 4, DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHB 13A of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (Januar",
