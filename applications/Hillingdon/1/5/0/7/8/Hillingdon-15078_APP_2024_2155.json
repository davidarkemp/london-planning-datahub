    "The proposed roof extensions, by reason of size, scale, bulk, massing, siting and design, would result in an over-dominant and disproportionate form of development that would disrupt the visual relationship with the subject dwelling as well as the symmetrical appearance with the adjoining property at No.38 Lawrence Drive, adjoining sites, and the local area. It would therefore have a harmful impact on the character and appearance of the site and streetscape. As such, the development is contrary to policies DMHB11 and DMHD1 of the Hillington Local Plan : Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021) and Chapter 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The proposed solar panels by reason of the overall number of panels, siting, scale, design and appearance would be harmful to the character and appearance of the existing dwelling, its semi-detached pairing, the visual amenity of the street scene, and the character of the wider area. The development is therefore contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) , Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020) and Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021) and Chapter 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2024).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
