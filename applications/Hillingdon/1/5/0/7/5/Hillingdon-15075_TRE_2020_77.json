    "The row of cedars forms a boundary between 1 Linksway and 1a linksway. It can be seen from a number of different properties and also the golf course/footpath to the rear. As a result as a group this row of Cedars has a Moderate-to-high amenity value and it significantly contributes to the arboreal character of the Copsewood Estate (Area of Special Local Character). The trees also contribute to local biodiversity and form part of the area of mature, protected trees that help to provide a gradual transition of mature tree cover between the dwellings in the Copsewood Estate and the nearby Ruislip woods National Nature Reserve.",

There is no indication as to when this occurred and no arboricultural evidence provided as to why the falling over of one tree (from the site visit this was an end tree) means the remaining row requires removal.",
