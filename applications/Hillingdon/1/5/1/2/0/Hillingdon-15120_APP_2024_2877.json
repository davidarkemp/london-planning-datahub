    "The development would fail to provide an acceptable quantum of safe and accessible car parking provision, which would increase parking stress and prejudice highway safety. The development therefore conflicts with Policies DMT 1, DMT 2 and DMT 6 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and Policies T2, T4 and T6 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "The applicant has failed to provide the appropriate level of detail regarding the operational management and the specific need of the proposal and it has not been demonstrated that the occupants of the proposed Class C2 children's care home would be provided with levels of care as defined in Article 2 of the Town and Country Planning (Use Classes) Order 1987 (as amended). In the absence of sufficient justification and when weighed against the loss of a single dwelling in use class C3, the principle of the development is considered to be unacceptable. The development therefore conflicts with Policies DMH 1 and DMH 8 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020) and Policy H12 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2021). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
