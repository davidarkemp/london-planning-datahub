    "The proposed extension including rear dormer, by reason of its combined siting, height, width, depth, bulk and massing would result in an excessive, bulky, dominant, overbearing and visually intrusive form of overdevelopment that would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original dwelling, would be detrimental to the character, appearance and symmetry of the semi-detached pair and context of which it forms a part and to the visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012) and Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The proposed two storey rear extension, by reason of its size, scaloe, bulk, width, depth and flat roof design would result in an excessive, bulky, dominant, overbearing and visually intrusive form of overdevelopment that would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original dwelling and would be detrimental to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012) and Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The proposed two storey side/rear extension, by reason of its size, scale, bulk and proximity to the side boundary, would result in a closing of the visually open gap between it and the neighbouring property, 62 Pavilion Way, giving rise to a cramped form of development and possible terracing effect, which would be detrimental to the visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area generally. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies.",
    "The proposed two storey side extension, by virtue of its siting, size, scale and design, including the lack of a set back from the front at all levels, would fail to appear as a subordinate addition and would thus be detrimental to the appearance of the original house, the visual amenities of the street scene and the character and appearance of the wider area. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "The proposed front extension, by virtue of its siting, size, scale, forward projection and design, would fail to appear as a subordinate addition and would thus be detrimental to the appearance of the original house, the visual amenities of the street scene and the character and appearance of the wider area. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "The proposed extension, in particular the first floor rear element, by reason of its siting, size, scale, bulk, width, depth and proximity would be detrimental to the amenities of the adjoining occupiers at 62 and 66 Pavilion Way, by reason of overdominance, visual intrusion, overbearing impact, sense of enclosure, loss of daylight/sunlight and loss of outlook. As such, the proposal would be contrary to Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The proposed single storey outbuilding, by reason of the siting, combined height, width and excessive height alongside its relation with the proposed extension to the dwelling would result in an excessive, bulky, dominant, overbearing, disproportionate and visually intrusive addition that would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition/relationship of the original dwelling, dominate the rear garden, would be detrimental to the character, appearance and symmetry of the semi-detached properties of which it forms a part and to the visual amenities of the surrounding area. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012) and Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The proposed extension to the dwelling and rear outbuilding both individually and cumulatively by reason of their size, scale, bulk, depth and width would result in an overdevelopment of the site and as a result would involve the substantial loss of the existing useable rear garden amenity whilst failing to appear subservient to the main property. Therefore, the proposal would be would be contrary to Policies DMHB 11, DMHD 1, DMHD 2 and DMHB 18 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2016). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020."
