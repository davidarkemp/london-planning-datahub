    "The establishment of a large HMO with up to ten occupants in the existing building, as retrospectively enlarged, is inappropriate and incompatible with the character and form of existing residential development in the local area, contrary to Policy DMH 5 of the Hillingdon Local Plan 2020.",
    "By virtue of the increase in the number of occupants, the proposal would give rise to undue noise and general disturbance to neighbouring residents from additional comings and goings and movements between parked vehicles on the street, contrary to Policy D14 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies DMH 5, DMHD 11 and Policy EM8 of the Hillingdon Local Plan 2020.",
    "The location of the parking in the rear garden disrupts the linear pattern of development with back to back rear gardens and reduces the opportunities for soft landscaping and tree planting, thereby harming the landscape character of the area, contrary to Sections 11 and 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021, Policy D8 of the London Plan 2021, Policy B1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan (Part 1) 2012 and Policies DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan (Part 2) 2020.",
    "In the absence of a Travel Plan and/or Transport Assessment and provision for suitable dropped kerb access to the site, it is not possible to conclude that the proposed development would be able to provide adequate on site car parking to serve the increase in the number of occupants, resulting in increased pressure upon on-street car parking and additional traffic congestion on local roads. There is also a lack of cycle parking, resulting in a lack of alternative suitable transport modes. This is contrary to Section 9 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021, Policies T5 and T6 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies DMH 5, DMT 1, DMT 2, DMT 5 and DMT 6 of the Hillingdon Local Plan 2020.",
    "The dwelling does not make any provision for outdoor amenity space and the main communal living space serving future residents has no light, outlook or ventilation. This arrangement results in a substandard form of accommodation for the occupants, contrary to Section 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021, Policy D6 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies DMH 5, DMHB 11 and DMHB 18 of the Hillingdon Local Plan 2020.",
    "In the absence of insulation details and by virtue of an increase in the number of proposed occupants, there is potential for increased noise transfer between the communal kitchen, parking area and living room and Bedroom 4, thereby impacting upon the acoustic amenity afforded to the occupant(s) of the room, contrary to Section 15 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021, Policy D14 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DMH 5 of the Hillingdon Local Plan 2020.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service. We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal.",
    "The block plan numbered BAL-1588 06 does not correspond with the development as constructed or as depicted on the floor plans as it omits the extensions more recently approved. This has implications for the implied outdoor amenity space and parking spaces as shown on the block plan. The assessment of the application is based on the as built development."
