    "The proposed rear extension, by virtue of its excessive size, width, bulk, depth, massing and proximity to the neighbouring boundaries, would be detrimental to the amenities of the neighbouring occupiers at 9 Stuart Close and 13 Stuart Close, by reason of overdominance, overshadowing, visual intrusion and loss of outlook. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policies BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHD 1, DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "The proposed rear extension, by virtue of its excessive size, width, bulk and massing, would appear as an insubordinate and incongruous form of development that would fail to respect the form and architectural composition of the host dwelling and would be harmful to the  character and appearance of the surrounding area. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policies BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHD 1, DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the Local Plan Part 1 and Local Plan Part 2. In addition further guidance was offered to the applicant by the case officer during the processing of the application to identify the amendments to address those elements of the scheme considered unacceptable which the applicant chose not to implement."
