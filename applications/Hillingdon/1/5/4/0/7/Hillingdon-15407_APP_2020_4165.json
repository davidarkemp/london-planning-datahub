  "description": "Construction of two additional storeys to the existing building to provide 8 x 2-bedroom flats",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed development, by reason of its prevailing height, bulk, mass and impact on the streetscape  represents an over-development of the site, would create an incongruous, overbearing and overly dominant form of development that would result in detrimental impacts on the local visual amenity and the surrounding well-established built environment contrary to Policies  DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHB 17 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy BE1 of the Local Plan Part 1 (2012), Policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021) and Paragraphs 95, 108, 110, 127 and 130, 131 of the NPPF (2019), National Design Guide Planning practice guidance for beautiful, enduring and successful places (2019) and Paragraphs 125, 129, 130, 131, 133 of the NPPF Draft text for consultation (2020).",
    "The proposed development fails to provide on or off-site affordable housing and in the absence of a financial viability assessment has failed to satisfactorily demonstrate the proposal cannot provide the requisite level of affordable housing contribution contrary to Policies Policy H2 of the Local Plan: Part One (2012) , Policy DMH 7 of the Local Plan: Part Two (2020), Policies H4, H5 and H13 of the London Plan (2021) and Paragraph 64 of the NPPF (2019) and The Mayor's Affordable Housing and Viability Supplementary Planning Guidance (SPG) (2017).",
    "The proposed development fails to offer a range of housing choices contrary to policy DMH 2 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020) and Policy H10 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "The proposed development would provide a substandard level of accommodation for future residents by reason of the number of windows that are obscure glazed with no outlook. It has also not been demonstrated that habitable rooms would achieve satisfactory daylight and as such, the proposal would provide a sub-standard level of accommodation and a poor living environment for future occupants contrary to Policy BE1 of the Local Plan: Part One (2012) and Policy DMHB 11 of the Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021), Paragraph 127  of the National Planning Policy Framework (2019) and the Mayor's Housing SPG (2016).",
    "The proposed development, in the absence of a car parking survey of surrounding streets and a tracking diagram of the basement spaces, fails to provide evidence that there is adequate on-street capacity to support the proposed development in the absence on any additional on-plot car parking spaces. This results in substandard car parking provisions, potentially leading to undue on-street parking demand to the detriment of on-street parking capacity and public/highway safety contrary to Policies DMT 1, DMT 2 and DMT 6 of the Local Plan: Part 2 Development Plan (2020) and Policies T6 and T6.1 London Plan (2021).",
    "The proposal fails to provide appropriately located and internalised access to refuse and recycling storage facilities for the future occupants of the proposed flats. As such, the development would be contrary to Policy DMHB 11 of the Local Plan: Part Two Development Management Policies (2020) and policy SI 8 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "The proposed development fails to provide onsite private or communal amenity space of a quantity and quality commensurate to the size of the proposals. The shortfalls identified result in a poor quality residential amenity for future occupiers, contrary to Policy BE1 of the Local Plan: Part One (2012), Policies DMHB 11 and DMHB 18 of the Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and Para 127 of the NPPF (2019).",
    "The proposed development, in the absence of a Daylight/Sunlight assessment, has failed to demonstrate the development would not harm the amenities of adjoining properties, garden space and adjacent  open space contrary to Policy BE1 of the Local Plan: Part One (2012) and Policy DMHB 11 of the Local Plan: Part Two (2020).",
    "The proposed development, in the absence of a Section 106 legal agreement, fails to provide contributions towards the improvement of services and facilities as a consequence of demands created by the proposed development. The scheme therefore conflicts with Policy DMCI 7 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two Development management Policies (2020), the London Borough of Hillingdon Supplementary Planning Document on Planning Obligations, Policy DF1 of the London Plan (2021) and paras 54-57 of the NPPF 2019.",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan(2021) and national guidance.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal.",
    "This is a reminder that Under the terms of the Planning Act 2008 (as amended) and Community Infrastructure Levy Regulations 2010 (as amended), should an application for appeal be allowed, the proposed development would be deemed as 'chargeable development' and therefore liable to pay the London Borough of Hillingdon Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and the Mayor of London's Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This would be calculated in accordance with the London Borough of Hillingdon CIL Charging Schedule 2014 and the Mayor of London's CIL Charging Schedule 2012.",
