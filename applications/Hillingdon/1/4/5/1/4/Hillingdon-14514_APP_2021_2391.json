    "In the absence of a tree report (including arboricultural impact assessment) to BS5837:2012, the submission has failed to demonstrate that the existing mature tree - T1 will be unaffected (including those immediately surrounding) by the development and has not made provision for its long term protection, alongside the expanse of hardstanding (patio) to the rear. No information has been submitted with regard to its type, value or condition and no explanation or justification given for its removal. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012) and Policies DMHB 6, DMHB 11 and DMHB 14 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",

Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020."
