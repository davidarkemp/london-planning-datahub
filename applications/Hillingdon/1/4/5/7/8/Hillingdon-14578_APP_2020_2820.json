  "description": "Variation of condition 2 (Approved Plans) of planning permission Ref: 14578/APP/2018/1492 dated 05/07/2018 ((Part two storey, part single storey side/rear extension and conversion of roofspace to habitable use to include raising of roof, 1 rear dormer, 1 side dormer and 4 side rooflights, involving demolition of existing single storey side/rear elements) to allow for the addition of a new dormer and changes to the elevations",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed side dormer by reason of its size, scale and bulk in conjunction with the approved dormers would result in an incongruous addition that would be detrimental to the character of the existing property and surrounding area. Therefore, the proposal would be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "The proposed front door by reason of its siting and design would have a detrimental impact on the character of the existing property and street scene. Therefore, the proposal would be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2016). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service. We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal.",
    "The applicant should note that the proposed amendments are considered to over and above what could be considered as material amendments and if they wish to reapply for these works a new planning application would be required."
