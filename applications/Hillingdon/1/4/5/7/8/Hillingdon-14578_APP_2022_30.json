  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed development, by reason of its siting, scale, bulk, height and design, fails to harmonise with the established local context, to the detriment of the character, appearance and visual amenities of the street scene and the wider area. Therefore the development conflicts with Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 (2012), Policies DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 (2020), Policies D3 and D6 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The proposed development, by virtue of its proximity, would cause harm to the living conditions of the existing neighbouring occupiers at numbers 15 and 19 Broadwood Avenue and their respective private amenity space, in terms of overlooking and loss of privacy. The proposal would therefore conflict with Policy DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The proposed development, does not demonstrate step free access and the plans do not align with all M4(2) technical specifications (as relevant), set out in Approved Document M to the Building Regulations (2015 edition). Therefore the development conflicts with Policy DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020)  and policy D7 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2021). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service. We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal.",
    "This is a reminder that Under the terms of the Planning Act 2008 (as amended) and Community Infrastructure Levy Regulations 2010 (as amended), should an application for appeal be allowed, the proposed development would be deemed as 'chargeable development' and therefore liable to pay the London Borough of Hillingdon Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and the Mayor of London's Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This would be calculated in accordance with the London Borough of Hillingdon CIL Charging Schedule 2014 and the Mayor of London's CIL Charging Schedule 2012.
