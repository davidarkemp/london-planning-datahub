    "The proposed development by reason of its overall scale, positioning, multiple roof forms and poor design when combined with the existing hip to gable and rear dormer roof extensions would result in an incongruous and visually awkward form of development that fails to appear subordinate as well as failing to respect the architectural composition of the existing dwellinghouse. The proposed development would therefore fail to harmonise with the established built environment resulting in  a detrimental impact on the character and appearance of the immediate street scene and the wider surrounding area. The proposal thereby fails to comply with Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One- Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), Policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021) and Chapter 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan - The Spatial Development Strategy for London consolidated with alterations since 2011 (2016) and national guidance."
