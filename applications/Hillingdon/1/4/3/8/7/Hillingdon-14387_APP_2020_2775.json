  "description": "Proposed barn extension to provide a restaurant at ground floor and 10 no. guest rooms at first floor, changing the use from a public house/restaurant to mixed use (Sui Generis), with associated works and landscaping.",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed development, by reason of its siting, size, scale, and design, would constitute inappropriate development within designated Green Belt land and very special circumstances do not exist to outweigh the harm to the Green Belt by reason of inappropriateness. As such, the proposal is contrary to Policy EM2 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policy DMEI 4 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (January 2020), Policy 7.16 of the London Plan (March 2016) and the National Planning Policy Framework (February 2019).",
    "The proposed development, by reason of its siting, size, scale, and design, would fail to preserve the significance of the Grade II Listed Building by posing 'less than substantial harm' to the significance of the designated heritage asset. Further, the proposed development is not considered to provide public benefits sufficient to outweigh the harm posed. As such, the proposal is contrary to Policies BE1 and HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 1, DMHB 2 and DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 - Development Management Policies (January 2020), Policy 7.8 of the London Plan (March 2016) and the National Planning Policy Framework (February 2019).",
    "The proposed development, by reason of its siting, size, scale, and design, would be detrimental to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the street scene. As such, the proposal is contrary to Policies BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policy DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 - Development Management Policies (January 2020),  Policies 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan (March 2016) and the National Planning Policy Framework (February 2019).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan - The Spatial Development Strategy for London consolidated with alterations since 2011 (2016) and national guidance.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service. We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
