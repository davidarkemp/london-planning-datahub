  "description": "Single storey rear extension",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed single storey rear extension, by virtue of its excessive cumulative scale, bulk, depth and proximity would unduly detract from the amenities of the adjoining occupier, No.142 Waltham Avenue by reason of visual intrusion, overdomination and loss of daylight and loss of outlook in conflict with Policies DMHB11 and DMHD1 of the Hillingdon Local plan - Part Two: Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The proposed development has failed to demonstrate that it would provide an adequate level of outlook for the future occupiers of the ground floor bedroom due to its close proximity to a boundary fence and flank wall of Number 138 Waltham Avenue  The proposal would therefore give rise to a substandard form of living accommodation to the detriment of the amenities of future occupiers contrary to Policy DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies and Policy LPD6 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the 'Saved' UDP 2007, Local Plan Part 1, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service. This is a resubmission of a previously refused scheme, where the Inspectors Report identified issues to be addressed, which were reflected in the reasons for refusal, allowing the opportunity to address those issues within this submission."
