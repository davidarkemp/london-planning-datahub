    "The development in terms of it's location, scale and appearance is considered to be detrimental and unsympathetic to the character and appearance of the host building and the surrounding street scene. The structures materials and design mean that it stands out against and clashes with the Victorian designed buildings in the surrounding area. For this reason, the development conflicts with Policies BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHB 13 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021) and Paragraph 131 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023). The application is refused for this reason and weighs significantly against the scheme in the planning balance.",
    "Neighbouring Amenity: The development by reasons of excessive depth, width and height, has a harmful impact upon the amenity of the neighbouring occupiers at 93 Cowley Mill Road in terms of loss of daylight, sunlight and outlook, in conflict with Policy DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "Highway Safety:  The development, by virtue of its location, has removed the pre-existing on-site parking provision and reduced the visibility for road users and pedestrians at the junction of Cowley Mill Road and Mill Avenue, and the front driveway of 93 Cowley Mill Road. The application submission fails to fully demonstrate that the proposal would not give rise to adverse impacts upon the highway network to the detriment of traffic congestion, parking stress and highway safety. Based on the information submitted, the proposed development is considered to have a harmful impact on highway safety, in conflict with Policies DMT 1 and DMT 2 of the Hi",

    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan (2021) and national guidance.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably. In addition further guidance was offered to the applicant by the case officer during the processing of the application to identify the amendments to address those elements of the scheme considered unacceptable which the applicant chose not to implement."
