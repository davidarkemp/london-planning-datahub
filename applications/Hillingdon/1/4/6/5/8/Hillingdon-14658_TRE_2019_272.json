    "These five mature Lime trees are situated on the southern boundary of the Guinness Trust estate site and are adjacent to the property of 16 Drakes Drive. None of these trees have been pollarded before and as a result, they have retained natural looking crowns, typical of these species. The trees are highly visible and have a moderate amenity value as a group - providing a screen. They make a good contribution to the visual amenity and arboreal character of the local area.",
    "The reasons given are not viewed as justified reasons for carrying out this level of pruning. These works would unnecessarily introduce large pruning wounds to these trees which would likely lead to infection. Additionally, the proposed work would reduce the size and amenity value of these trees significantly and would also be detrimental to their natural appearance.",
    "These trees are not currently considered to be in need of pollarding and therefore the proposed work is viewed as unnecessary and unjustified, however,",
