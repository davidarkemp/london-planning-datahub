    "The proposed dwelling, by virtue of its size, scale, bulk, roof design and siting on this prominent corner plot, would represent a visually unsympathetic form of development that would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original semi-detached dwelling, would be detrimental to the character, appearance and symmetry of the pair of semi-detached houses of which it forms a part and to the visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area. Therefore, the proposal would be contrary to Paragraph 135 of the NPPF (2024), Policies D3, D4, D6, D8, GG4, H1, and H10 of the London Plan (2021), Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012), and Policies DMH6, DMHB 11, DMHB 12, and DMHB 14 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The development, by virtue of its design, siting and proximity, would result in neighbouring occupiers at 89 Heather Lane experiencing loss of outlook, overlooking, loss of privacy, and visual intrusion. The development would harm the residential amenity of the area and, therefore, conflicts with Policies D3 and D6 of the London Plan (2021) and  Policies DMHB 11 and DMHB 18 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The Applicant has failed to demonstrate that the development would provide safe and acceptable vehicle access and car and cycle parking. As a result, it would increase parking stress, prejudice highway safety, and fail to encourage sustainable modes of transport, including cycling, walking, and public transport. The development is, therefore, contrary to Paragraph 116 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2024), Policies T2, T4, T5, and T6 of The London Plan (2021), and Policies DMT 1, DMT 2, DMT 5, and DMT 6 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The proposed dwelling would fail to provide satisfactory internal living conditions for future occupants, contrary to Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021) and Policy DMHB 16 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "In the absence of sufficient biodiversity net gain information, the Applicant has not demonstrated that the proposal would deliver at least a 10 per cent increase in biodiversity value relative to the pre-development biodiversity value of the onsite habitat. As the proposed development fails to provide an appropriate onsite Biodiversity Net Gain, it is contrary to Schedule 7A of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as inserted by Schedule 14 of the Environment Act 2021), Policy G6 of the London Plan (2021), Policy EM7 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part One (2012), and Policy DMEI 7 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two (2020).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "In order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably. In addition further guidance was offered to the applicant by the case officer during the processing of the application to identify the amendments to address those elements of the scheme considered unacceptable. However, the amendments required to make the application acceptable are substantial and would materially change the development proposal. They would require further consultation to be undertaken pri",
    "This is a reminder that Under the terms of the Planning Act 2008 (as amended) and Community Infrastructure Levy Regulations 2010 (as amended), should an application for appeal be allowed, the proposed development would be deemed as 'chargeable development' and therefore liable to pay the London Borough of Hillingdon Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and the Mayor of London's Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This would be calculated in accordance with the London Borough of Hillingdon CIL Charging Schedule 2014 and the Mayor of London's CIL Charging Schedule 2012.",
