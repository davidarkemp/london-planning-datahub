    "The proposed detached rear outbuilding, by reason of its combined height, width, depth, plot coverage and design would result in an excessive, visually intrusive and overbearing addition that would dominate the host plot and fail to read as a secondary outbuilding. The development would be detrimental to the character and appearance of the area and would be jarring to the visual amenities of this prominent corner site. Therefore, the proposal would fail to comply with Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021), Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012)and  Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12, DMHD 1 and DMHD 2 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The proposed detached rear outbuilding, by reason of its size, scale, excessive footprint, internal layout and the provision of facilities is considered capable of independent occupation from the main dwelling and is thus tantamount to a separate dwelling in a position where such a dwelling would not be accepted, due to the impact on the existing dwellings, quality of accommodation and the requirement for car parking and amenity space. Therefore, the proposal would fail to comply with Policies D3, D6, T6 and H1 of the London Plan (2021), Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012) and Policies DMH 6, DMHB 11, DMHB 12, DMHD 1, DMHD 2, DMHB 18, DMT 2 and DMT 6 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The proposed detached rear outbuilding, by reason of the siting and placement of the rear facing bedroom window alongside sub-standard nature in terms of internal floor space would give rise to poor quality living accommodation for occupiers of the outbuilding.  Therefore, the proposal would fail to comply with Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021), Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012) and Policies DM HD1, DM HD2 and DMHB 16 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2021). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020."
