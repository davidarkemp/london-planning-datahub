    "The proposal, by reason of its size, scale, width, in combination with the existing garages, would fail to appear as a subordinate addition, would thus fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original dwellinghouse and would be detrimental to the visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area which lies within the Raisins Hill ASLC. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policy BE1 and HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB5, DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020) and Policies D4, D8 and GC1 of the London Plan (2021).",
