    "Insufficient information has been provided to demonstrate that the proposed development would promote the principles of 'inclusive design' and fails to demonstrate how the proposed commercial unit would be accessed, used and exited safely and easily for all future users including those with impaired mobility. The development is therefore contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020) and Policy D5 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF).",

The development would therefore be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policy DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF).",
