    "The proposed amendments, which includes the erection of a new rear dormer, would substantially change the nature and appearance of the proposal (including its setting within the Gatehill Farm Estate, Northwood, Area of Special Local Character), when compared to the development originally granted under planning permission 14787/APP2021/2528. Furthermore, the proposed erection of a new dormer would require Officer's to assess the planning merits of the proposed modified scheme, which goes beyond the parameters of a non-material amendment. The proposed changes would therefore constitute a material amendment for which planning permission is required.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "a) We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal.",
    "The applicant is advised that a planning application under Section 70 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 should be submitted for the proposed development for consideration by the local planning authority."
