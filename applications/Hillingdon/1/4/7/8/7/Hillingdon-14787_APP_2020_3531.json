    "The development proposed by reason of its design, scale and massing (in particular the three storey front gable would directly harm the significance of the Gatehill Farm Estate Area of Special Local Character.  The proposal, therefore, will not accord with Policies DMHD 1, DMHB 5, DMHB 6 and DMHB 11 London Borough of Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2019).",
    "The proposed development by reason of its design, scale and siting will result in the loss of a 'B' grade tree protected by TPO and will pose a serious threat of damage to, or loss of, additional protected and 'B' grade trees in spite of the prescribed tree protection measures. The cumulative loss of the trees will be detrimental to the character and appearance of the Gatehill Farm Estate Area of Special Local Character. The proposal, therefore, is unacceptable and fails to satisfy the requirements of Policies DMHB 6, DMHB 11 and DMHB 14 of the London Borough of Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The applicant has failed to submit a flood risk assessment and other required assessments, including a site investigation, Geo-technical and hydrological assessments to determine the flood risk and demonstrate the level of groundwater within the site over a period of time to ensure that an understanding of the environmental implications are taken into account during the design phase, which can then demonstrate that basement developments do not harm the built and natural environment or local amenity. The proposal, therefore, fails to satisfy the requirements of Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 3 of the London Borough of Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020)."
