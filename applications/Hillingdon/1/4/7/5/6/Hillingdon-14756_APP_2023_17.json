    "The development, by reason of its scale, massing, siting, design, and materials, would fail to harmonise with the existing local and historic context of the surrounding conservation area, resulting in less than substantial harm to the designated heritage asset, which is not outweighed by any identified public benefits. The principle of intensifying the use of the site through the part loss of a garden area would have a detrimental impact on the residential character, appearance, visual amenities and local distinctiveness of the area. The development therefore conflicts with Policies HE1 and BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012), Policies DMH 6, DMHB 4, DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020), Policies D3 and HC1 of the London Plan (2021) and Paragraphs 135c) and 208 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023).",
    "The site is located within a conservation area and adjacent to a tree protection area which is covered by TPO order 472. In the absence of a tree survey, arboricultural method statement and tree protection plan, the application does not make adequate provision for the protection and long-term retention of valuable trees and results in the loss of trees that contribute positively to the local landscape character of the conservation area. The development therefore conflicts with Policies DMHB 4, DMHB 11 and DMHB 14 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policies G1 and G7 of the London Plan (2021) and Paragraph 136 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023).",
    "The application is not supported by clear and unambiguous information to satisfactorily demonstrate that the development proposal would not result in an intensification of the site or a new separate use that would not preserve neighbouring residential amenity. Notwithstanding, the provision of a large outbuilding of this size for commercial use in this garden location would represent an unneighbourly form of development that would be considered harmful to the character and residential amenities of the area. The development therefore conflicts with Policy DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two, Policies D13 and D14 of the London Plan (2021) and Paragraph 135f) of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023).",
    "The layout proposed does not allow enough room for a vehicle to turn and leave the garage in forward gear and as a result, the development proposal would increase road danger and prejudice highway and pedestrian safety. The development therefore conflicts with Policies DMT 1 and DMT 2 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and Policy T4 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2021). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
