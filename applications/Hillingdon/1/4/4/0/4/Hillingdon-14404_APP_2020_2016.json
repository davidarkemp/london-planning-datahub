  "description": "Installation of vehicular crossover to front and installation of fencing",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposal by reason of the loss of the boundary treatment to the frontage and the majority of the soft landscaped front area and its replacement with an excessive area of hardstanding and 1.6 m tall fencing to the front would be detrimental to the visual amenity of the street scene and the character and appearance of the area in which it would be set. The proposals is thus, contrary to Policies DMHD 1, DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "Due to the insufficient depth of the hard standing area on the frontage, the proposed vehicle crossover, by reason of vehicles reversing in or out of the site into oncoming traffic, close to a roundabout junction, onto Belmont Road, and the increase in the number of potential conflict points along the road would result in the disruption of the free flow of traffic and would be detrimental to highway and pedestrian safety contrary to Local Plan: Part 2 Development Plan (2020) Policies DMT 1 and DMT 2 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2016). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020."
