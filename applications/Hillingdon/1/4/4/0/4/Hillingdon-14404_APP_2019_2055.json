    "The proposed vehicle crossover, by reason of vehicles reversing in or out of the site into oncoming traffic, close to a roundabout junction, on to Belmont Road, and the increase in the number of potential conflict points along the road would result in the disruption of the free flow of traffic and would be detrimental to highway and pedestrian safety contrary to Policies AM7 and AM14 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Saved UDP Policies (November 2012) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document HDAS: Residential Extensions.",
    "The proposal by reason of the partial loss of the boundary treatment to the frontage and the majority of the soft landscaped front area and its replacement with an excessive area of hardstanding, would be detrimental to the visual amenity and character of the area in which it would be set by creating an open parking area and emphasising the appearance of a hard surfaced area. The proposals is thus, contrary to Policies BE13, BE19 and BE38 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two -Saved UDP Policies (November 2012) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document HDAS: Residential Extensions.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the 'Saved' UDP 2007, Local Plan Part 1, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service."
