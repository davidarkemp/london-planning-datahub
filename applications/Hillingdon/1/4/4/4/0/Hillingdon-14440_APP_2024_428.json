    "The proposed extension by reason of its size, scale, bulk, height, depth, width, proximity to the side boundary and projection forward of the return building line along Chester Close, in this open prominent position, would result in the closing of an important gap characteristic to the area, resulting in a cramped appearance. The proposal would therefore represent an overdevelopment of the site to the detriment of the visual amenities of the street scene and the character and appearance of the surrounding area. The proposed development is therefore contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies D4 and D8 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies DMHB11; DMHB12 and DMHD1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan - Part Two."
