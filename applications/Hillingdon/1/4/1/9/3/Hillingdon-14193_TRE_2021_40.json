  "description": "To carry out tree surgery, including a crown reduction by 2.5m and crown thin by 15% to one Oak, T1 on TPO 777",
  "application_type": "All Other",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "Amenity: The Oak is an individual tree located in a predominant position with high visibility from multiple angles. With its widespread crown, it has a strong arboreal character and provides a great contribution to the amenity of the area. This Oak has a high-to-very high amenity value.",
    "Appraisal: The tree crown looks in good condition. Pruning would unnecessarily introduce large multiple wounds into the crown, which would likely cause stress and lead to infection, affecting the long-term health of the tree. This would affect the safe useful life expectancy of this tree. Pruning would also result in weakly attached re-growth forming that would be prone to future failure.",
    "The proposed work to reduce the crown and cut back branches will substantially affect the appearance of the tree and the amenity or arboreal character of the area.",
    "As there is no evidence of previous reductions on the tree crown, routine maintenance is not a valid arboricultural reason as the work has not been carri",
    "The removal of deadwood, dangerous / hanging branches and ivy:  This does not require the formal consent of the Council.",
    "Statutory crown lifting of trees: This does not require formal consent of the Council if the clearance only involves the removal of epicormic growth and branches to give a separation between the footway and the tips of the lowest branches by up to 2.3m or the carriageway by up to 5.2m."
