    "The inappropriate design of the proposed part two-storey, part single-storey side extension results in an awkward juxtaposition of the proposed hipped roof with the existing roof works, which fails to harmonise with the architectural composition of the host dwelling and would be detrimental to the character, appearance, and visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area. The proposal is, therefore, contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012) and Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12, and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service."
