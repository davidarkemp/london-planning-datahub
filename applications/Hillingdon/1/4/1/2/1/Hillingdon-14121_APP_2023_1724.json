    "The proposed two storey side extension, by virtue of its size, scale, bulk and design, including the awkward juxtaposition of the proposed roof with the existing roof works, would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the host dwelling and would be detrimental to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "The two storey side extension, by virtue of its proximity to the boundary would result in the harmful loss of a first floor gap and an associated terracing effect, which would appear cramped and incongruous with the character and appearance of the wider street scene. As a result the development as a whole would fail to comply with Policies DMHD1 and DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2016). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020."
