    "The proposed two-storey side and two-storey rear extensions, by virtue of their siting, size, scale and design, including the nature of the set backs from the building line and roof levels, and by virtue of the positioning of the two-storey rear extension, would fail to appear as a subordinate addition and would result in an awkward and incongruous stepped building form and appearance. Thus, it would be detrimental to the appearance of the original house and the pair of semis, the visual amenities of the street scene and the character and appearance of the wider area. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021) and Section 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021)."
