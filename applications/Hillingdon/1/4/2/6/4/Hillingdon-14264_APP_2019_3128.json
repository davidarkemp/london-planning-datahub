  "description": "Single storey front/side extension, part two storey, part single storey side/rear extension and conversion of roofspace to habitable use to include a rear dormer and 2 x front rooflights.",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed two storey side/rear extension by reason of its size, scale, bulk and lack of set back from principal elevation, would result in a cramped form of development, which would be detrimental to the character and appearance of the existing street scene and the adjoining Northwood Hills Area of Special Local Character. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies BE13, BE15, BE19 and BE22 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Saved UDP Policies (November 2012), Policy DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies with Modifications (March 2019) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document HDAS: Residential Extensions.",
    "In the absence of sufficient evidence to demonstrate that the proposed development would not have an undue impact on the amenity of adjoining residential properties it is considered that the proposed two storey side/rear extension may have a detrimental impact on the residential amenity of 126 and 130 Northwood Way contrary to Policies BE20 and BE21 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Saved UDP Policies (November 2012) and Policy DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies with Modifications (March 2019).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the 'Saved' UDP 2007, Local Plan Part 1, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service."
