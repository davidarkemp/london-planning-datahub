    "The proposed two storey side extension, by virtue of its design, scale, bulk and siting adjacent to the boundary, as well as the proposed roof form, in combination with the existing roof extensions, would represent a disproportionate addition to the original dwellinghouse that would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original semi-detached dwellinghouse (and its neighbour), harming the visual amenities of the street scene. The proposal would therefore be contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "The proposed two storey side extension, by virtue of its design, scale, bulk and siting adjacent to the boundary in combination with the existing roof extensions, would result in an overly dominant and overbearing feature that overshadows the adjoining properties at 21 and 23 Falling Lane and as such would result in a visually intrusive and an un-neighbourly form of development, resulting in a loss of light and material loss of residential amenity. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to policies DMHB11 and DMHD1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan - Part Two (2020).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2021). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020."
