    "The proposed two storey side extension, by virtue of its design, scale and bulk, lack of set back from the front elevation, siting adjacent to the boundary and gabled roof design in combination with the existing roof extensions, would result in a closing of the visual open gap at first floor  and would represent a disproportionate addition to the original dwellinghouse that would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original semi-detached dwellinghouse and to the visual amenities of the street scene. The proposal would therefore be contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "The proposed two storey side extension, by virtue of its design, scale and bulk, lack of set back from the front elevation, siting adjacent to the boundary and gabled roof design in combination with the existing roof extensions, would result in an overly dominant and overbearing feature that overshadows the adjoining properties at 21 and 23 Falling Lane and as such would result in a visually intrusive and an un-neighbourly form of development, resulting in a loss of light and material loss of residential amenity. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to policies DMHB11 and DMHD1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan - Part Two (2020).",
    "The proposed extensions would, by virtue of its failure to maintain an adequate amount of private usable external amenity space for the occupiers of the existing property, result in over-development of the site detrimental to the residential amenity of the existing occupiers. The proposal is therefore contrary to Part 2 Policy DMHD1 appendix A, Part A) vi), which states that for Alterations and extensions to residential dwellings; adequate garden space is retained.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
