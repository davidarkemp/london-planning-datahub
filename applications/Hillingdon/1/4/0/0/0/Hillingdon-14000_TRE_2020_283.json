    "The Hornbeam is situated within the front garden and the mixed species group including Silver Birch is situated within the rear garden to the side of the properties. They provide a gradual transition of mature tree cover between the dwellings in the copse wood estate and the nearby Ruislip Woods National Nature Reserve (NNR). The benefit in amenity and biodiversity afforded by the trees is both present and future because they have the potential for long life expectancies. As a result, they have a collective Moderate to High amenity value and significantly contribute to the arboricultural character of the Copse Wood Estate an Area of Special Local Character (ASLC).",
    "The trees are situated close to the boundary line with 24 Nicholas way although it is unclear as to why branches overhanging the boundary line is seen as an issue. The reduction of only one side of the trees will lead to an unnatural lopsided appearance.",
