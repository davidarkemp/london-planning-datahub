    "The proposed two storey side and front extension and single storey rear extension, by reason of its combined siting, design, height, width, depth, bulk and massing, would result in a dominant, overbearing, visually intrusive, incongruous and excessive form of development, failing to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original dwelling, and would be detrimental to the character, appearance of the Gate Hill Farm Estate Area of Special Local Character and visual amenities of the street scene. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies BE1 and HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHD 1, DMHB 1, DMHB 5, DMHB 6, DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021)."
