    "In the absence of a sufficient Basement Impact Assessment, the applicant has failed to demonstrate that the proposal would not or has not caused unacceptable harm to the built and natural environment and local amenity and that it would not result in flooding or ground instability. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy DMHD 3 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The proposed development, when viewed as a whole, would be disproportionate, overly prominent and unsympathetic to the original architectural composition of the host dwelling, resulting in the proposed development having a harmful impact to original dwelling, and the character, appearance and visual amenities of the area. Therefore, the proposed development would be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan (November 2012), Policies DMHD 3, DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan - Part Two (2020) and Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021) and Chapter 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023).",
    "There is an error on the proposed plans, specifically with regard to the proposed rear dormers. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the impact of this element of the proposal on the character and appearance of the area or original dwelling, contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan (November 2012), Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan - Part Two (2020) and Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021) and Chapter 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023).",
    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate, with sufficient evidence, that the trees which make a valuable contribution to the amenity of the area, can and will be retained on site and not damaged during construction works. As such, the proposal is contrary to policies DMHB 11 and DMHB 14 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 (2020) and Policies G5, G6 and G7 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service. We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
