    "The proposed part two storey, part single storey side/rear extensions, by virtue of their design, scale and bulk, staggered form and roof designs, would result in a closing of the visual open gap between this row of terrace properties (Nos.102-108 Collingwood Road) and the semi-detached dwellinghouses at Nos.98-100 Collingwood Road and would represent disproportionate additions to the original dwellinghouse that would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original end of terrace dwellinghouse.  The proposed development would also be detrimental to the character, appearance and symmetry of this terraced row of dwellinghouses of which it forms a part and to the visual amenities of the street scene on Collingwood Road. The proposal would therefore be contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Par",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service."
