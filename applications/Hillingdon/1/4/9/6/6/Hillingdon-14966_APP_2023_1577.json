    "The proposed development, by reason of its size, bulk, scale and design, would represent an incongruous and visually intrusive form of development which would breach the return building line in Warley Road and would be detrimental to the spacious character and appearance of the corner plot and the visual amenity of the street scene and the surrounding area, contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB11 and DMHB12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan - Part Two.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
