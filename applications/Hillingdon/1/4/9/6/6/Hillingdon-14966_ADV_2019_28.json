    "The proposal would result in the provision of signage on a building which is considered unacceptable as it would represent an incongruous and visually intrusive form of development. The proposed sign, by reason of its siting on this building would thus represent an incongruous and visually intrusive form of development which would be detrimental to the visual amenity of the street scene and the surrounding area, contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and policies BE13 and BE27 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Saved UDP Policies (November 2012).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the 'Saved' UDP 2007, Local Plan Part 1, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service. This is a resubmission of a previously refused scheme, where the Inspectors Report identified issues to be addressed, which were reflected in the reasons for refusal, allowing the opportunity to address those issues within this submission."
