    "The proposed part single-storey, part two-storey side extension, by reason of its size, scale, bulk, height, lack of set back from the front elevation, and proximity to the side boundary, would not be a subordinate addition to the semi-detached house or respect its architectural integrity. The proposal would also close an important building gap that is characteristic of the area, resulting in a cramped appearance. The proposal would be an overdevelopment of the site to the detriment of the visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area's character and appearance. The proposed development is contrary to Policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021), Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012), and  Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the  Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
