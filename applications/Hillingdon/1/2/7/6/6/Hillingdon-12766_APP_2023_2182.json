    "The cumulative impacts of the existing and proposed extensions by reason of their combined and excessive scale, bulk, width, size, design and siting would result in an unsympathetic and incongruous over development of the site which would fail to read as subordinate to the host property, harming the original design and appearance of the host property and failing to preserve or enhance the character and appearance of the Ruislip Village Conservation Area. Therefore, the proposal fails to comply with Policies HE1 and BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHD 1, DMHB 4, DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021) and Chapter 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",

Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020."
