  "description": "Single storey porch infill extension",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed porch infill extension, by reason of design and impact on the appearance of the existing front porch projection, would harmfully alter an original and attractive characteristic feature of the property. The loss of original features to this building within the Ickenham Village Conservation Area would cumulatively erode the quality and character of the designated heritage asset. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy DMHB 4 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2021). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. The Council's supports pre-application discussions. We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
