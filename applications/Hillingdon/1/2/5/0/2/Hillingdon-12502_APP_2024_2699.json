    "Prior to commencement of the hereby approved development, a 'Planning Fire Safety Strategy' which meets the requirements of Policy D12 (A) of the London Plan (2021)  shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority. Thereafter, the development shall be constructed and maintained for its lifetime in accordance with all fire safety resilience, management and mitigation measures set out within the strategy.",
    "Reason:",
    "To ensure that the development and occupants of the building are safe from fire hazards in accordance with the requirements of Policy D12 (A) of the London Plan (2021).",
    "Due to the site being within the crane circle for Heathrow Airport the crane operator is required to submit all crane details such as maximum height, operating radius, name, and phone number of site manager along with installation and dismantling dates to the CAA Airspace Coordination and Obstacle Management Service (ACOMS) system.",
    "For notification, please follow the link via CAA website: Crane notification | Civil Aviation Authority (caa.co.uk)",
    "Once crane notification has been received from the CAA, Heathrow Works Approval Team will assess and issue the necessary crane permit. No cranes should operate on site until a crane permit has been issued."
