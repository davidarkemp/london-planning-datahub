    "The application fails to demonstrate that the proposed agricultural building is reasonably required in terms of the continued functioning of an agricultural unit. The proposal therefore fails to provide sufficient justification for the proposal in terms of NPPF (February 2019), Policy 7.16 of the London Plan (March 2016) and Policy DMEI 4 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "The proposal involves the demolition of an existing building whose design and siting make it suitable for bats. In the absense of any ecological surveys to establish the presence or otherwise of protected species on site, the proposal fails to demonstrate that there would be no detrimental impact on protected species, contrary to the NPPF (February 2019), Policy 7.19 of the London Plan (March 2016) and Policy DMEI 7 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "In the absence of any Tree Survey and Arboricultural Implication Assessment to BS5837:2012 standards and existing and proposed land level information, the Local Planning Authority was unable to fully assess the likely impact of the proposal, including the extension of hardstanding areas, on nearby trees and their root protection areas. As such, the proposal fails to demonstrate that the development would not have a detrimental impact on the retention and longevity of surrounding trees. The proposal is thus contrary to Policy 7.21 of the London Plan (March 2016) and Policies DMHB 14 and DMEI 7 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan - The Spatial Development Strategy for London consolidated with alterations since 2011 (2016) and national guidance.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal.",
    "This is a reminder that Under the terms of the Planning Act 2008 (as amended) and Community Infrastructure Levy Regulations 2010 (as amended), should an application for appeal be allowed, the proposed development would be deemed as 'chargeable development' and therefore liable to pay the London Borough of Hillingdon Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and the Mayor of London's Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This would be calculated in accordance with the London Borough of Hillingdon CIL Charging Schedule 2014 and the Mayor of London's CIL Charging Schedule 2012.",
