    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate, with the submission of details, that landscaping scheme would successfully preserve and enhance the visual amenities of the locality and provide adequate facilities, failing to comply with policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12, DMHB 14, DMEI 1 and DMT 2 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 (2020) and Policy G5 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "The landscaping scheme proposed on drawing 20/026_LP1 increases the soft landscaping at the corner of the site which would reduce the extent of hardstanding and soften the impact of the parking to the front.  The submitted plan however does not contain any details of the boundary treatment.  The submitted plan indicates cycle store and bin storage, however no details have been submitted in this respect (other than plan form).  Concerns are also raised in terms of the planting specification and lack of fencing detail in respect of the Highway comment on the parent consent which required visibility to not exceed  600mm within 2m of the vehicular access.  The details are not considered sufficient to enable discharge of condition 4."
