    "The proposal is for a detached structure which, by reason of its size, scale, layout and independent access, is considered capable of independent occupation from the main dwellinghouse and is thus tantamount to a separate dwelling in a position where such a dwelling would not be acceptable as it could result in an unacceptable impact on the residential amenity of adjoining occupiers and would also have additional requirements for parking and amenity space.  The proposal is therefore contrary to policies DMHB 11, DMHB 18, DMT 6 and DMHD 2 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and Policies D6 and T6.1 of the London Plan (March 2021)."
