    "The constructed boundary treatment, by reason of its siting, scale, design and appearance which is visually prominent, would form an uncharacteristic, overbearing and incongruous addition to the area, which would fail to integrate with Copse Wood Way and Oak Glade street scene and the wider Copse Wood Estate Area of Special Local Character. The proposal would therefore be detrimental to the visual amenity and character of the surrounding area,  contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies, contrary to Policies HE1 and BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies, DMHB 5, DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020)."
