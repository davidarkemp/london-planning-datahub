    "The development hereby permitted shall be begun before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.",
    "REASON",
    "To comply with Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990.",
    "The development hereby permitted shall not be carried out except in complete accordance with the details shown on the submitted plans, numbers Shed 1 (received 31/01/2023), Shed 2 (received 31/01/2023), Shed 3 (received 31/01/2023), Shed 4 (received 31/01/2023) and shall thereafter be retained/maintained for as long as the development remains in existence.",
    "REASON",
    "To ensure the development complies with the provisions Hillingdon Local Plan Parts 1 (November 2012) and 2 (January 2020) and the London Plan (2021).",
    "Notwithstanding the approved plans, the outbuilding hereby permitted shall be used only for purposes incidental to the residential use of the No.41 St Lawrence Drive, Eastcote, and shall remain within the same planning unit. The outbuilding shall at no time be used for purposes such as a living room, bedroom, kitchen or as a separate unit of accommodation.",
    "REASON",
    "To avoid any future undesirable fragmentation of the curtilage or the creation of a separate residential use and in the interests of protecting the amenity of adjoining residential properties in accordance with Policy DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan - Part Two (2020).",
    "Trees, hedges and shrubs shown to be retained on the approved plan shall not be damaged, uprooted, felled, lopped or topped without the prior written consent of the Local Planning Authority. If any retained tree, hedge or shrub is removed or severely damaged during construction, or is found to be seriously diseased or dying another tree, hedge or shrub shall be planted at the same place or, if planting in the same place would leave the new tree, hedge or shrub susceptible to disease, then the planting should be in a position to be first agreed in writing with the Local Planning Authority and shall be of a size and species to be agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority and shall be planted in the first planting season following the completion of the development or the occupation of the buildings, whichever is the earlier. Where damage is less severe, a schedule of remedial works necessary to ameliorate the effect of damage by tree surgery, feeding or groundwork shall be agreed",
    "Unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority, the outbuilding hereby permitted shall be constructed in accordance with the details and methods outlined in the Design and Access Statement received 31 January 2023 and thereafter retained in this form for the life of the development.",
    "REASON",
    "To ensure that the proposed development will preserve and enhance the visual amenities of the locality and provide adequate facilities in compliance with policies DMHB 11 and DMHB 14 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 (2020) and Policies G5, G6 and G7 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "The decision to GRANT planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2021). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020."
