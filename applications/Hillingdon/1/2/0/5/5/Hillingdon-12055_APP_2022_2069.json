    "The proposed additional storeys would not be constructed on the principal part of the building that was granted permission under application reference 12055/APP/2006/2510. The application submission therefore fails to accord with provision AA.1.(d), Class AA, Part 20, Schedule 2 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "The floor to ceiling height of the proposed additional storeys, measured internally, would exceed the floor to ceiling height, measured internally, of the principal part of the existing building. The application submission therefore fails to accord with provision AA.1.(e) (ii), Class AA, Part 20, Schedule 2 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "By virtue of its height, scale, bulk and massing, the proposed development would harm the external appearance of the building. Prior approval is therefore refused under Condition Class AA.2.(1)(e), Part 20, Schedule 2 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "The proposed development fails to demonstrate that the retained service road would be capable of maintaining adequate delivery and service vehicle access to adjacent commercial properties without the need for vehicles to reverse excessive distances and that the 8 additional parking spaces would be feasible and workable. As such, it has not been adequately demonstrated that the proposal would not give rise to additional on-street parking and lead to conditions which would be prejudicial to the operation of the highway network and pedestrian and highway safety, contrary to Policies DMT 1, DMT 2 and DMT 6 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 - Development Management Polices (March 2020).",
    "Insufficient information, based on the latest BRE guidelines (June 2022) has been submitted in order to enable the Local Planning Authority to establish whether the proposed development would provide the provision of adequate natural light in all habitable rooms of the new dwellinghouses. Prior approval is therefore refused under Condition Class AA.2.(1)(f), Part 20, Schedule 2 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "Insufficient information, based on the latest BRE guidelines (June 2022) has been submitted in order to enable the Local Planning Authority to establish whether the proposed development would adversely impact on the amenity of the existing building and neighbouring premises, in respect to the loss of light. Prior approval is therefore refused under Condition Class AA.2.(1)(g), Part 20, Schedule 2 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "The applicant has failed to secure parking permit restrictions for future occupiers and a Travel Plan which are both required to mitigate the parking and highways impacts created by the proposed development. Prior approval is therefore refused under Condition Class AA.2.(1)(a), Part 20, Schedule 2 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended)."
