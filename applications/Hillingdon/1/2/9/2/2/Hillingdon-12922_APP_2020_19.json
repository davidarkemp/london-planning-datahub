  "description": "Part two storey, part single storey, part first floor side/rear extension",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed development, by reason of its size, scale, bulk and proximity to the side boundary would result in an unacceptable closing of the visually open gap between this and the neighbouring property at No. 127 Exmouth Road, giving rise to a cramped form of development. The proposal would therefore be detrimental to the visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area, contrary to Policies DMHD 1 and DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the 'Saved' UDP 2007, Local Plan Part 1, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service. In order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably. In addition further guidance was offered to the applicant by the case officer during the processing of the application to identify the amendments to address those elements of the scheme considered unacceptable which the applicant chose not to implement.",
    "The applicant is advised that the proposed plans are not consistent as the single storey pitched roof to the front of the side extension has been omitted on the front elevation."
