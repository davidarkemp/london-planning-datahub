    "The proposed development, by reason of its size, scale, bulk and proximity to the side boundary would result in an unacceptable closing of the visually open gap between this and the neighbouring property at No. 127 Exmouth Road, giving rise to a cramped form of development. The proposal would therefore be detrimental to the visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area, contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies BE13, BE15, BE19 and BE22 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Unitary Development Plan Saved Policies (November 2012), the adopted Supplementary Planning Document HDAS: Residential Extensions and Emerging Policies DMHD 1 and DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies with Modifications (March 2019).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the 'Saved' UDP 2007, Local Plan Part 1, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service. In order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably. In addition further guidance was offered to the applicant by the case officer during the processing of the application to identify the amendments to address those elements of the scheme considered unacceptable which the applicant chose not to implement.",
    "The applicant is advised that the proposed plans are not consistent as the ridge heights of the proposed side/ rear extension differ on the proposed elevations. For the purposes of this determination, it has been assumed that the front elevation is correct.",
    "Furthermore, the applicant is advised that should a revised application be submitted in an attempt to overcome the reason for refusal, the characteristic roof of the existing property, whose angle of pitch shallows towards the eaves should be replicated on the proposed extension."
