    "The proposed development, by virtue of the on-site car parking spaces directly in front of the main habitable room windows serving Flats 1 and 2, would cause unacceptable noise, disturbance, overlooking and a loss of privacy (both real and perceived) for the future occupants of these flats as well as compromised access to the private rear gardens for Flat 3 and 4, and compromised access to the refuse storage and cycle parking for all prospective residents. The proposal would therefore result in a substandard form of internal and external residential accommodation to the detriment of the amenity of the future occupiers of the proposed development, contrary to Policies DMHB 15, DMHB 16, DMHB 18 and DMT 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020), Policies D6 and T5 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan (2021) and national guidance.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal.",
    "This is a reminder that under the terms of the Planning Act 2008 (as amended) and Community Infrastructure Levy Regulations 2010 (as amended), should an application for appeal be allowed, the proposed development would be deemed as 'chargeable development' and therefore liable to pay the London Borough of Hillingdon Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and the Mayor of London's Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This would be calculated in accordance with the London Borough of Hillingdon CIL Charging Schedule 2014 and the Mayor of London's CIL Charging Schedule 2012.",
    "For more information on CIL matters please visit the planning portal page at: www.planningportal.gov.uk/planning/applications/howtoapply/whattosubmit/cil",
    "Please be advised that the revised ground floor plan showing the site layout (ref. P-49 BA-03 Rev A) was sent to Democratic Services and received by Planning Services on the day of the Planning Committee. Consequently, while this revised drawing was accepted and considered in the recommendation for refusal, it should be noted that the site layout shown on the proposed block plan is inconsistent with revised drawing ref. P-49 BA-03 Rev A."
