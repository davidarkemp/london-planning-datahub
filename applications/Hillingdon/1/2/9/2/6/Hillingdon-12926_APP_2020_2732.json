  "description": "Demolition of existing bungalow and erection of two storey building to provide 3 x 2-bed and 1 x 1-bed self-contained flats.",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed development, by virtue of the siting of the new driveway to the side of the building and the siting of the proposed parking spaces to the front and rear would result in unacceptable harm to the living conditions of the existing occupiers at 47 Beech Avenue and future occupiers of the proposed ground floor units, by reason of noise and disturbance from vehicles arriving and departing at all times of the day/night, contrary to Policy DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and Policy 3.5 of the London Plan (March 2016).",
    "The proposed development, by reason of the use of the communal amenity space and its proximity to ground floor windows of flats 1 and 2 would result in unacceptable harm to the living conditions of future occupiers of the proposed ground floor units, by reason of noise, disturbance and loss of privacy, contrary to Policy DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The proposal has not demonstrated that sufficient off street parking/manoeuvring arrangements would be provided, and therefore the development is considered to result in substandard car parking provision, leading to on-street parking/queuing to the detriment of public and highway safety and contrary to policies DMT 2 and DMT 6 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020) and to Hillingdon's Adopted Parking Standards as set out in Appendix C of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "The proposal, by reason of the extensive coverage of the site by buildings and hardsurfacing, including car parking and cycle and bin storage provision would result in a cramped overdevelopment of the site which would result in a large area of hardstanding/parking to the frontage and would not allow sufficient space to mitigate this impact by way of soft landscaping. The proposal would therefore be detrimental to the visual amenities of the street scene and character and appearance of the wider area. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHB 14 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan - The Spatial Development Strategy for London consolidated with alterations since 2011 (2016) and national guidance.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service. We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal.",
