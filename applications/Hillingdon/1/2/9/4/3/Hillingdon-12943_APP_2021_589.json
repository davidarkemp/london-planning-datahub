  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposal by reason of its design and external facade materials (render finish and roller shutter window design) fails to harmonise with the local context and has an adverse impact on the character and appearance of the host property, existing streetscene and wider area. The proposals are therefore considered contrary to the objectives of Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One Strategic Policies (2012), Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12, DMHD 1 of the Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and Policies D3 and D6 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service."
