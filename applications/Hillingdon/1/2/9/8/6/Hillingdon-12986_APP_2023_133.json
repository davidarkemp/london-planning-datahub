    "The proposed dwelling, by virtue of its side gable roof form, bulk and massing, would appear as an incongruous and disproportionately sized building, which would unbalance the physical appearance of the row of terraced dwellings it would form part of, and fails to respect the roof form symmetry of the opposite dwelling at number 317A Victoria Road and the adjacent dwelling at number 309A Victoria Road. The proposal would therefore be detrimental to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area, contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), Policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The proposed rear dormer, by reason of its excessive size, scale, bulk, massing, design and height, would appear as a visually obtrusive form of development which would significantly detract from the overall roof form of the terrace block it would form part of. The proposal would therefore be detrimental to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the surrounding area, contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012), Policies DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The proposed development, by virtue of its inadequate amount of gross internal floor area, would result in substandard form of internal living conditions for the future occupiers of the proposed dwelling. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy DMHB 16 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "In the absence of a legal agreement to prohibit the implementation of the Certificate of Lawfulness application 12986/APP/2023/295 in conjunction with the subject full application, the proposal would fail to provide private external amenity space of a sufficient size and quality  for the existing and proposed dwellings. This would give rise to a substandard form of living accommodation to the detriment of the external amenity space provision of the existing and future occupants of the resultant development. The proposal therefore conflicts with Policy DMHB 18 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and the  National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The proposed development, by virtue of its constrained site layout, internal design of the proposed dwelling , and absence of details to show that the internal layout would comply with Approved Document M of Building Regulation requirement M4(2), fails to demonstrate that adequate provision would be made to meet the needs of people with disabilities. The proposed development therefore conflicts with Policies D5 and D7 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "In the absence of a preliminary ecology report, there is insufficient information to demonstrate that the proposed development, which would involve the demolition of a two storey side extension and garage, would not cause any harm to protected specifies (which includes bats). The proposal therefore fails to demonstrate that the no harm would be caused to protected species and their habitats, contrary to Policy G6 of the London Plan (2021), Policy DMEI 7 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "a) We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal.",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan - The Spatial Development Strategy for London consolidated with alterations since 2011 (2016) and national guidance.",
    "This is a reminder that Under the terms of the Planning Act 2008 (as amended) and Community Infrastructure Levy Regulations 2010 (as amended), should an application for appeal be allowed, the proposed development would be deemed as 'chargeable development' and therefore liable to pay the London Borough of Hillingdon Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and the Mayor of London's Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This would be calculated in accordance with the London Borough of Hillingdon CIL Charging Schedule 2014 and the Mayor of London's CIL Charging Schedule 2012.",
