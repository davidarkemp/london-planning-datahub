    "The proposed front extensions by reason of its size, scale, bulk, projection and design would result in an incongruous and visually intrusive form of development that could not be considered to constitute subordinate additions to the existing dwellinghouse and the works would fail to respect the architectural composition of the existing dwellinghouse resulting in a detrimental impact on the character and appearance of Blaydon Close. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012), Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two- Development Management Policies (2020) and Chapter 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The proposed rear steps and terrace development by reason of its size, scale, projection, siting and proximity to the shared boundaries would result in undue overlooking which would have a direct impact on the amenities of 130 and 134 Northwood Way, resulting in a harmful loss of privacy, all contrary to the aims and requirements of Policy DMHB11 and DMHD1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan - Part Two (2020)."
