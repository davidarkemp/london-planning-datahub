    "The proposed outbuildings, by virtue of their excessive size, scale, bulk, and siting, would be wholly uncharacteristic of the area and would represent intrusive additions to the site, which would be harmful to the established verdant character and appearance of the local area in conflict with Policies D1, D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021), Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012), and Policies DHMB 11, DMHB 12, DMHB 14, and DMHD 2 of the London Borough of Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The submitted Tree Survey and Arboricultural Impact Assessment has failed to demonstrate that the development would safeguard existing trees on the site and further fails to demonstrate protection for and long-term retention of the trees. The proposal is, therefore, contrary to Policies G7 of the London Plan (2021) and policies DMHB11 and DMHB14 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service."
