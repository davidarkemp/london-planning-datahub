    "The proposal, by virtue of the alterations to the front elevation and the scale, bulk and siting of the proposed side dormer windows, would fail to respect the architectural integrity of the original detached chalet bungalow and represent an incongruous and unsympathetic addition to the streetscene which lies within the Orchard Drive, Hamilton Road, Clayton Way Area of Special Local Character. The proposal is therefore contrary to BE1 and HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan (November 2012)  and policies DMHB5, DMHB11, DMHB12 and DMHD1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan - Part Two (2020).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
