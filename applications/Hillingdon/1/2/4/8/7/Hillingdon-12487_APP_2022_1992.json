    "The extended dwelling, by virtue of its size, volume, footprint, scale, bulk and increased height, is considered to significantly increase the built up appearance of the site. The proposal represents inappropriate development within the green belt which results in harm to the open character and appearance of this important designation. Further, the Applicant has failed to demonstrate any very special circumstances to justify the development. The development is therefore harmful to the Green Belt, contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework, Policy G2 of the London Plan (2021), Policy EM2 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policy DMEI 4 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
