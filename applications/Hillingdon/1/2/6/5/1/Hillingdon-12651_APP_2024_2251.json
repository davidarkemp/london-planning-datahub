    "The proposed single storey side extension by reason of its size bulk and massing would cause a severe detrimental impact of the amenity of the adjoining neighbour at no 41 Oakdene Road, in terms of daylight, sunlight, outlook and overbearing effect. Therefore the proposed side extension would be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies and Policies  DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHB 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies."
