    "The proposed extension by reason of its size, scale, bulk, height, proximity to the side boundary and projection forward of the return building line along The Mallows, in this open prominent position, would result in the closing of an important gap, at first floor level, characteristic to the area, resulting in a cramped appearance. The proposal would therefore represent an overdevelopment of the site to the detriment of the visual amenities of the street scene and the character and appearance of the surrounding area. The proposed development is therefore contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies."
