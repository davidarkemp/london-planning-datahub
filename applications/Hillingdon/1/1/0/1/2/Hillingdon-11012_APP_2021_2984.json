    "The proposed part two storey/part single storey rear extension, by reason of its size, scale, bulk, height and design (including the uncharacteristic crown/dummy roof profile and unsympathetic fenestration treatment), would appear as a disproportionate and incongruous addition that would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original dwelling, and would be detrimental to the appearance of the host dwelling, the character, appearance and visual amenities of the area and would fail to either preserve or enhance the character or appearance of the surrounding Ruislip Village Conservation Area. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies BE1 and HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012), Policies DMHB 1, DMHB 4, DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policies D1, D3, D4 and HC1 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The proposed rear dormers, by reason of their excessive size, scale and bulk, coupled with their siting and design, would appear as incongruous and visually obtrusive forms of development which would significantly detract from the original roof form of the property and fail to either preserve or enhance the character and appearance of the surrounding Ruislip Village Conservation Area. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies BE1 and HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012), Policies DMHB 1, DMHB 4, DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policies D1, D3, D4 and HC1 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The proposed part two storey/part single storey rear extension, by reason of its proximity, depth, scale, bulk and height, would have a harmful impact on the living conditions of the occupiers at number 55 Kingsend and their associated private amenity space, in terms of loss of outlook, overdominance, sense of enclosure and overbearing impact. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012),  Policies DMHD 1 and DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "In the absence of an Arboricultural Impact Assessment, Method Statement and Tree Protection Plan, the application has failed to demonstrate that the trees at and adjoining the site would not be affected by the proposed development and that provision would be made for their long term protection. The proposal would therefore be detrimental to the verdant character, appearance and visual amenities of the surrounding Ruislip Village Conservation Area, contrary to Policy BE1 and HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012), Policies DMHB 1, DMHB 4, DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHB 14 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two- Development Management Policies (2020), Policies D1, D3, HC1 and G1 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2016). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "a) We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
