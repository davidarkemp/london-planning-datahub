  "description": "Change of use from solicitor office (Former Class A2) to restaurant (Former Class A3) within same Class use E and proposed extractor flue.",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed extractor flue, by reason of its scale, bulk, design and inappropriate siting on the north/side elevation of the neighbouring Grade II listed building 14 High Street, would fail to harmonise with the historic local context, thereby resulting in less than substantial harm to the listed building and failing to preserve and enhance the appearance and character of the conservation area. This harm would not be outweighed by public benefits associated with the proposal. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies BE1 and HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 1, DMHB 2, DMHB 4, DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "In the absence of a satisfactory odour assessment, the application has failed to demonstrate that the extraction equipment/flue would not unacceptably harm the amenity of adjacent and nearby occupiers. Consequently, the proposal is contrary to Policy DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy D13 (E) of the London Plan (2021) and the NPPF.",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan (2021) and national guidance.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service. We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
