    "The site is in the Green Belt where there is a general presumption against any development other than that essential for agriculture or that falling within any of the exceptions set out in Paragraph 154g) of the NPPF (2023). The development proposed does not accord with those policies, it does not fall within any of the exceptions contained therein, nor are there any special circumstances or reasons to justify overriding the policies.  The principle of development is considered to be unacceptable. The development therefore conflicts with Policy DMEI 4 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy G2 of the London Plan (2021) and Paragraphs 152, 153 and 154 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023).",
    "Due to the scale and proportions of the development and the significant loss of trees within the site, the development would harmfully erode the open and verdant appearance of the site and degrade the integrity of the landscape character. By virtue of it being inappropriate development, the development would cause significant harm to the character and appearance of the area. The development therefore conflicts with Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One Strategic Policies (2012), Policies DMHB 11 and DMHB 14 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020)  and Policies D3 and G1 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "In the absence of a full ecological assessment relevant to the description of development, the applicant has failed to demonstrate that the development would not affect ecology and biodiversity. The development therefore conflicts with Policy DMEI 7 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and Policy G6 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "Due to the proximity and siting of Bedroom 2 window of Unit 3, the occupiers of Unit 4 would experience significant loss of privacy and overlooking of their private amenity space. The development would fail to provide a high quality and usable amenity space for Unit 4 due to it being overlooked by Unit 3 resulting in harm to residential amenity and unsatisfactory living conditions for the occupiers of Unit 4. The development therefore conflicts with Policies DMHB 11 and DMHB 18 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020) and Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2021). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020.",
    "This is a reminder that Under the terms of the Planning Act 2008 (as amended) and Community Infrastructure Levy Regulations 2010 (as amended), should an application for appeal be allowed, the proposed development would be deemed as 'chargeable development' and therefore liable to pay the London Borough of Hillingdon Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and the Mayor of London's Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This would be calculated in accordance with the London Borough of Hillingdon CIL Charging Schedule 2014 and the Mayor of London's CIL Charging Schedule 2012.
