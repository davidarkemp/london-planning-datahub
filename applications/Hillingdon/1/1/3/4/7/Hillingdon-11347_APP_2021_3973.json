    "The proposed side extension link, by virtue of its siting and prominence, combined height, width and depth would result in an incongruous, uncharacteristic, disjointed and awkward addition that would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original dwelling, would be detrimental to the relationship with the semi-detached property at No.266 Long Lane (and the immediate surrounding corner plots of the area which have characteristic gaps), general character and appearance of the area and some impact to the visual amenities of the streetscene. Therefore, the proposal would be contrary to the requirements of Policies D1 and D4 of the London Plan (2021), Policies BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Development Management Policies (2012) and Policies DMHD 1, DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2021). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020."
