    "The proposed development, by reason of its bulk, scale, massing and overall design would result in an incongruous visually prominent form of development that would fail to harmonise with the character and architectural composition of the surrounding properties, resulting in a visually dominant building which would be detrimental to the character, appearance and visual amenity of the street scene and the setting of Ruislip Village Conservation Area. The proposal therefore conflicts with Policies BE1 and HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012), Policies DMHB 1, DMHB 4, DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policies HC1, D1, D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021) and the NPPF (2023).",
    "Due to its scale, bulk and overall design, the proposed development would have an overbearing impact on the adjoining residents leading to a harmful sense of enclosure and loss of privacy to the residents of Nos 8, 10, 12 and 14 Poplars Close. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012), Policy DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2023).",
    "The private amenity space provide is not adequate in terms of quantity and quality and would be overlooked. In addition, due to the use of boundary treatment to demarcate private amenity occupiers of Flat 2 and  Flat 3 would experience a loss of outlook given the proximity to the proposed 1.8m high patio fence. Further, Flat 1, bedroom 2 and Flat 4, bedroom 1 and 2 would not benefit from adequate outlook. Therefore, the development would fail to provide a high quality internal amenity space and external usable amenity space resulting in harm to residential amenity and unsatisfactory living conditions for the occupiers. The development therefore conflicts with Policies DMHB 11 and DMHB 18 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020) and Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "Insufficient supporting information to demonstrate that the proposed development is would offer a convenient location for refuse and recycling facilities, given the pull distance of over 60m which fails to accord with Policy DMHB11 part (d) of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The proposal fails to demonstrate through a comprehensive fire statement how the development would achieve the highest standards of fire safety in regard to its design in incorporating appropriate features which reduce the risk to life in the event of a fire, its construction methods, means of escape, strategy of evacuation and providing suitable access and equipment for firefighting appropriate for the size and residential nature of the development. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policies D5 and D12 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2023).",
    "The applicant has failed to secure Section 106 planning obligations required to mitigate the harm and demands created by the proposed development (in respect of air quality). The scheme therefore conflicts with Policy DMCI 7 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 (2020); the adopted Planning Obligations Supplementary Planning Document (2014); Policy DF1 of the London Plan (2021); and paragraphs 55-58 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan (2021) and national guidance.",
    "This is a reminder that Under the terms of the Planning Act 2008 (as amended) and Community Infrastructure Levy Regulations 2010 (as amended), should an application for appeal be allowed, the proposed development would be deemed as 'chargeable development' and therefore liable to pay the London Borough of Hillingdon Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and the Mayor of London's Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This would be calculated in accordance with the London Borough of Hillingdon CIL Charging Schedule 2014 and the Mayor of London's CIL Charging Schedule 2012.",
