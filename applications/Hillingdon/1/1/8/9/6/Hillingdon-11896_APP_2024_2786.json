    "The proposed development, by reason of the provision of facilities within the outbuilding and independent access to the outbuilding, would be tantamount to a separate self-contained residential unit in a position where such a dwelling would be unacceptable. Consequently, the proposed development would harm the area's character and appearance and the amenity of neighbouring residents. The proposal is, therefore, contrary to Chapter 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023), Policies D1, D3, D4, and D6 of the London Plan (2021), and Policies DMH 6, DMHD 2, and DMHB 11 of the  Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
