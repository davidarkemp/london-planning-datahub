    "The proposed garage conversion would result in the loss of existing off-street car parking and the proposal makes no provision for its replacement.  The proposal would therefore be likely to result in additional on-street parking to the detriment of highway and pedestrian safety, contrary to policies AM7(ii) and AM14 of the adopted Hillingdon Unitary Development Plan (Saved Policies, September 2007) and the Council's adopted Car Parking Standards (Annex 1, adopted Hillingdon Unitary Development Plan, Saved Policies, September 2007).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
