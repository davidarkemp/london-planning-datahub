    "The proposed extension's design, scale, and appearance would not appear subordinate and sympathetic to the dwelling and neighbouring properties. The inappropriate extension would be out of keeping with the prevailing planning approved development pattern to the detriment of the subject dwelling's appearance and the area's character. The proposal is contrary to Policy D3 of The London Plan and Policies BE1, DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the London Borough of Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two Development Management Policies (2020)."
