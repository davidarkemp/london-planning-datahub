    "The proposal would, by its depth, width, height, bulk, and location, result in a built form which would be harmful to the amenities of the neighbouring occupiers at 23 Berkeley Road (to the north) through loss of light and outlook, contrary to Policies D3 and D6 of The London Plan and Policies DMHD 1 and DMHB 11 of Hillingdon Council's Local Plan Part Two Development Management Policies (2020), which seek to protect residential amenity.",
    "The proposed extension's design, scale, and appearance would not appear subordinate and sympathetic to the dwelling and neighbouring properties. The inappropriate extension would be out of keeping with the prevailing planning approved development pattern to the detriment of the subject dwelling's appearance and the area's character. The proposal is contrary to Policies D3 and D6 of The London Plan and Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the London Borough of Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two Development Management Policies (2020)."
