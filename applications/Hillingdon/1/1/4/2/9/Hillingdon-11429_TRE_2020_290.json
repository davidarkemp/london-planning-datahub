The applications seek the Council's permission to fell a total of three mature, protected Oaks. All are significant and prominent landscape features to those living in, and visiting, Long Lane, Uxbridge.

They contribute to local biodiversity and assist with removing pollutants from the air. The benefit in amenity and biodiversity afforded by the trees is both present and future because they have the potential for long life expectancies.",

    "The removal of deadwood, dangerous / hanging branches and ivy:  This does not require the formal consent of the Council."
