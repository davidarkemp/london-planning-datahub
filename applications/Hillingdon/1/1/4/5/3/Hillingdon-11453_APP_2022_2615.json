    "The proposed two storey side and rear extension by reason of its size, scale, bulk, height, depth, width, design, windows adjoining the footway and proximity to the side boundary, in this open prominent position, would result in a cramped appearance and would appear disproportionate to the adjoining semi-detached dwelling. The proposal would therefore represent an overdevelopment of the site to the detriment of the visual amenities of the street scene and the character and appearance of the surrounding area. The proposed development is therefore contrary to Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the  Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "The proposed two storey side and rear extension, by reason of its size, scale, bulk, width and design would result in an incongruous addition which would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original dwelling,and would fail to appear subservient to the host dwelling, resulting in an excessive, oppressive, dominant and poorly designed two-storey side and rear extension. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the  Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "In addition the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably and further guidance was offered to the applicant by the case officer during the processing of the application to identify the amendments to address those elements of the scheme considered unacceptable which the applicant chose not to implement."
