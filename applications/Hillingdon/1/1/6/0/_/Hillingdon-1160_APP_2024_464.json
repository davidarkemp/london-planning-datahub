    "The proposed rear extension by reason of its excessive bulk, siting, scale, massing and design would be insubordinate, visually incongruous and unsympathetic to the original architectural composition of the host dwelling, resulting in the proposed development having a harmful impact to original dwelling, and the character, appearance and visual amenities of the area. The proposal would therefore conflict with  Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One Strategic Policies (2012) and Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The proposed extensions by reason of there excessive bulk, siting, scale and massing would result in a significant reduction in private amenity space whilst increasing the number of bedrooms. As such the proposal fails to provide adequate usable private amenity space to accord with the Council's adopted standards as expressed in Table 5.3: Private Outdoor Amenity Space Standards, resulting in a cramped form of development which would provide inadequate standards of living accommodation for future occupiers. The proposal is therefore contrary to the Council's adopted policies in particular Policy DMHB 18 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020)."
