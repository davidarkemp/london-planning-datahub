    "The proposed fascia and graphic signs, by reason of their design, use of materials and means of illumination, would be detrimental to the architectural composition of the original property, to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the street scene and would fail to either preserve or enhance the character or appearance of the surrounding Northwood Town Centre, Green Lane Conservation Area. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies BE1 and HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 1, DMHB 4 and DMHB 13A of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), Policy 7.8 of the London Plan (2016) and the NPPF.",
