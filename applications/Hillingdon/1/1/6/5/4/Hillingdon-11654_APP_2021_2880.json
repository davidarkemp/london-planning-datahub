    "The proposed two storey side/rear extension, by reason of its combined size, scale, bulk, height, width, depth and design, including the lack of a set back from the front at all levels, would result in an excessive, bulky, dominant, disproportionate, overbearing and visually intrusive form of development that would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original semi-detached dwelling, would be detrimental to the character, appearance and symmetry of the pair of semi-detached houses of which it forms a part and to the visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "The proposed rear dormer, by reason of its siting, height, depth, width, bulk and massing would result in an excessive, bulky, dominant, visually intrusive, boxy and top heavy addition that would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original dwelling, relationship with the attached pair of which it forms a part, would be detrimental to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the street scene. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012) and Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2016). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020."
