    "Due to its height, design, layout, siting and site coverage, the proposed dwelling and associated development would form a cramped, uncharacteristic and visually incongruous development which would fail to harmonise with the local character and appearance of the surrounding area. The proposal is therefore detrimental to the visual amenity and character of the surrounding area, contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies, Policies DMH 6, DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policies D1, D3 and D6 of the London Plan (2021), as well as paragraphs 71, 124 and 130 of the NPPF (2021).",
    "The first floor bedroom window within the new dwelling would provide views toward the rear elevation windows and garden of No.43 Woodstock Gardens. Due to the position of the window and its close proximity to the mentioned neighbour, the proposed development would cause excessive overlooking and a significant loss of privacy to the detriment of the neighbours amenities and living conditions. The proposal is therefore considered to be contrary to Policies DMH 6 and DMHB 11, of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021), and paragraph 130 (f) of the NPPF (2021).",
    "Insufficient evidence has been submitted to demonstrate that adequate functional parking space would be provided for the new dwelling as well as 43, 43a and 45 Woodstock Gardens. In the absence of adequate and policy compliant parking provisions for each of the mentioned dwellings, the proposed development would lead to road side parking, which would create a more hazardous environment for road users and pedestrians. The proposal would therefore result in a more dangerous environment for pedestrians and vehicle users, having an adverse impact on the free flow of traffic on the local highways network. The development is therefore contrary to Policies DMT 2 and DMT 6 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), as well as policy T4 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "The proposed dwelling would fail to meet the requirements for a M4(2) accessible and adaptable dwelling as set out in Approved Document M to the Building Regulations (2015 edition). The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy D7 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan (2021) and NPPF (2021).",
    "This is a reminder that Under the terms of the Planning Act 2008 (as amended) and Community Infrastructure Levy Regulations 2010 (as amended), should an application for appeal be allowed, the proposed development would be deemed as 'chargeable development' and therefore liable to pay the London Borough of Hillingdon Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and the Mayor of London's Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This would be calculated in accordance with the London Borough of Hillingdon CIL Charging Schedule 2014 and the Mayor of London's CIL Charging Schedule 2012.",
