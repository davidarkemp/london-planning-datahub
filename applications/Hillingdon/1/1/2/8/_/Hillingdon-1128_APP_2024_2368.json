    "The siting, scale, bulk, massing and architectural composition of the building would erode the setting of the Locally Listed Old Crown Public House resulting in a moderate to high level of less than substantial harm to the significance of the Locally Listed Building which would not be outweighed by the public benefits of the development, contrary to Policy DMHB 3 of the Local Plan Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020); Policy HC1 of the London Plan; and Paragraph 209 of the NPPF.",
