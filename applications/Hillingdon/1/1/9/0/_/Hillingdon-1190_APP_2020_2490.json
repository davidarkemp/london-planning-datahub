    "The details received pursuant to condition 3 (Materials), in particular the roof tiles, are considered to be out of character with the street scene and surrounding area. The details received pursuant to condition 4 (Landscaping) are considered to be insufficient. The proposal fails to provide the required area of soft landscaping within the area of hard standing together with plant schedules and a brief specification to ensure that the planting is successfully established. In the absence of such, the scheme fails to comply with Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHB 14 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part - Development Management Policies (2020)."
