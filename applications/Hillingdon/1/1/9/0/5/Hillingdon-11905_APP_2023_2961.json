    "Due to its excessive width, size, bulk and scale of the extension and its proximity to the side boundary, the proposal would form a disproportionate and overly dominant addition to the host dwelling which would fail to respect its original size or architectural composition, subsequently causing harm to its character and appearance. Furthermore due to the design and prominent corner plot location, the resulting property would appear unduly prominent and overdeveloped when viewed from the street scene, causing significant harm to the character and appearance of the surrounding area and Harmondsworth Conservation Area. The proposed development is therefore considered to be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 4, DMHD 1, DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020) and paragraphs 130 (a) and (c) of the NPPF (2021).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service. We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
