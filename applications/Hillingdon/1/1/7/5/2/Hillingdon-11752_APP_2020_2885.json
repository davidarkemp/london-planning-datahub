  "description": "Demolition of existing bungalow and erection of two x 3 bed semi-detached dwellings with associated parking, refuse and cycle storage",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed development, by reason of its size, scale, bulk, and design would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the adjoining properties and would be detrimental to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and Policies 3.5 and 7.4 of the London Plan.",
    "The proposal, by reason of its extensive coverage by buildings and hardsurfacing/car parking layout would result in a cramped overdevelopment of the site which would result in a large area of hardstanding/parking on this frontage and would not allow sufficient space to mitigate this impact by way of soft landscaping. The proposal would therefore be detrimental to the visual amenities of the street scene and character and appearance of the wider area. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies DMHB 11 and DMHB 14 of the Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The proposal has not demonstrated that the design and layout of the units would provide dwellings which are accessible and adaptable, and therefore the development is contrary to policy DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020) and Policy 3.8 of the London Plan (2016).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan - The Spatial Development Strategy for London consolidated with alterations since 2011 (2016) and national guidance.",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2016). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the 'Saved' UDP 2007, Local Plan Part 1, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service."
