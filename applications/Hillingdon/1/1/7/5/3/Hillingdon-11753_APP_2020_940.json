  "description": "Construction of a lean-to extension at the rear of garden.",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The development hereby permitted shall be begun before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.",
    "REASON",
    "To comply with Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990.",
    "The development hereby permitted shall not be carried out except in complete accordance with the details shown on the submitted Block Plan received on 25-03-20 and Proposed Plans and Elevations received on 03-04-20 and shall thereafter be retained/maintained for as long as the development remains in existence.",
    "REASON",
    "To ensure the development complies with the provisions Hillingdon Local Plan Parts 1 (November 2012) and 2 (January 2020) and the London Plan (2016).",
    "Prior to installation, details of the felt roofing finish and timber tongue and groove boards shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority. Details shall include manufacturer information, the product type and/or code and colour finish, where relevant. Works shall be carried out in accordance to approved details.",
    "REASON: To preserve the setting of the Listed Buildings, in accordance to policy HE1 of Hillingdon's Local Plan: Part 1, policies DMHB 1 and 2 of the Hillingdon's Local Plan: Part 2, The London Plan (2016) and the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990.",
    "Notwithstanding the provisions of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 1995, no fences, gates or walls shall be erected other than those expressly authorised by this permission.",
    "REASON",
    "The erection of such means of enclosure would be detrimental to the open plan character of the estate.",
    "During works the existing curtilage listed wall shall be appropriately safeguarded. Any damage or disturbance caused to the curtilage listed wall in execution of the approved works shall be reported to the Local Planning Authority made good to the satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority within six months of the works being completed using appropriate traditional materials.",
    "REASON: To preserve the curtilage listed wall, in accordance to policy HE1 of Hillingdon's Local Plan: Part 1, policies DMHB 1 and 2 of the Hillingdon's Local Plan: Part 2, The London Plan (2016) and the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990.",
    "On 1 July 1997, a new act, The Party Wall etc. Act 1996, came into force.",
    "This Act requires a building owner to notify, and obtain formal agreement from, any adjoining owner, where the building owner proposes to:-",
    "1)      carry out work to an existing party wall;",
    "2)      build on the boundary with a neighbouring property;",
    "3)      in some circumstances, carry out groundworks within 6 metres of an adjoining building.",
    "Notification and agreements under this Act are the responsibility of the building owner and are quite separate from Building Regulations or planning controls. Building Control will assume that an applicant has obtained any necessary agreements with the adjoining owner, and nothing said or implied by Building Control should be taken as removing the necessity for the building owner to comply fully with the Act.",
    "Notwithstanding the approved plans the application hereby approved is for Householder Planning Consent Only. The application site comprises of a Grade II Listed Building and accordingly it is considered that Listed Building Consent will be required prior to the commencement of any development on the site.",
    "REASON",
    "To ensure the development complies with the provisions of Policy DMHB 2 of the Hillingdon Local Plan - Part 2 - Development Management Policies (Jan 2020).",
    "The decision to GRANT planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to GRANT planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan - The Spatial Development Strategy for London consolidated with alterations since 2011 (2016) and national guidance.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably."
