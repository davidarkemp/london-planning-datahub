    "The trees are highly visible from Gatting Way and B483 Park Road and therefore have a high amenity value.",
    "The Arboricultural report dated October 2024 recommends T3 to be felled (G1 on TPO 312). This work is deemed appropriate due to the condition of the tree.",
    "The Arboricultural report dated October 2024 recommends crown reductions to T1 and T2. This work is deemed inappropriate as there is no arboricultural reasons for the work. The report states - 'Two of the horse chestnuts (trees numbered one and two) require only crown reduction to reduce the risk of failure'. This has not been backed up with any supporting evidence as to why they believe the limbs will fail.",
    "Conclusion: Having regard to the proposed (allowed) works, this will not have a detrimental impact on the visual amenity or arboreal character of the local area.",
    "Having regard to the proposed (un-allowed) crown reduction works for T1, and T2. The proposed 2m crown reduction has not been justified and will have a detriment",
    "No felling shall take place until such time as a scheme has been submitted to, and approved in writing by, the Local Planning Authority for a replacement tree(s), which shall be of 'Standard' size (about 2-3m high) and short-staked for support. The replacement tree shall be planted during the first planting season following the felling works hereby permitted. Thereafter, the replacement tree(s) shall be retained indefinitely and maintained (watered and weeded during the spring and summer) for 2-3 years, or until established.",
    "REASON",
    "In order to comply with the requirements of Section 206 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990.",
    "To carry out tree surgery including to fell One Horse Chestnut (TP3 on map). In G1 within TPO 312.",
    "To carry out tree surgery including to crown reduce by 2.5m One Horse Chestnut (TP1 on map), to crown reduce back to previous points One Horse Chestnut (TP2 on map). All in G1 within TPO 312.",
    "The removal of deadwood, dangerous / hanging branches and ivy:  This does not require the formal consent of the Council.",
    "Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981:  Note that it is an offence under this act to disturb roosting bats, nesting birds or any other protected species.  Therefore, if applicable, it is advisable to consult your tree surgeon / consultant to agree an acceptable time for carrying out the approved works.",
    "Owner(s)'s permission:  Permission should be sought from the owner(s) of the tree(s) and / or the owner(s) of the land that the tree(s) overhang prior to any approved work being carried out.",
    "Expected standard of tree work: The approved works must be carried out in accordance with the conditions laid out above. If they are not, then enforcement action could being taken which could lead to prosecution and heavy fines. Therefore, it is highly recommended that the works are only carried out by a professional and competent arboriculturist who undertakes to comply with the conditions of this consent and in accordance with industry best practice (BS 3998:2010). The Arboricultural Association can provide details of its approved contractors, who have demonstrated such professionalism and competence, on their website (www.trees.org.uk) or by calling 01242 522152. Or on request the Council can provide a list of contractors who are known to carry out tree work to a good standard and to normally maintain an appropriate policy of indemnity insurance."
