    "The cumulative effect of the proposed extensions and alterations to the side boundary treatment (with the creation of dropped kerb, loss of existing mature boundary treatment and creation parking space), together with the existing two storey side extension, by reason of their size, bulk, design and scale, in this open prominent position, would result in the closing of an important gap characteristic to the area, result in a cramped appearance and would cumulatively result in an insubordinate and visually incongruous form of development that would be detrimental to the character and appearance of the original property and surrounding area. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2021), Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management (2020), Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021) and Chapter 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "a) We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
