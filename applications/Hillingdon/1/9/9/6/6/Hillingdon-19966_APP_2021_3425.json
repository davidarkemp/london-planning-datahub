    "The proposed extension by virtue of its size, siting, scale, bulk and design would appear as a boxy addition which fails to respect the architectural composition of the host terrace, harming both the character and appearance of both the host building and wider area, including the sensitive views from Yiewsley Recreation Ground, designated Metropolitan Land. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12, DMHB 13, DMEI 4 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two Development Management Policies (2020) and Policy G3 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "The proposal has failed to demonstrate sufficient cycle storage for the future occupiers in order to encourage sustainable modes of transport, contrary with the London Plan and Policy DMT6 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "In the absence of a robust assessment and detailed information relating to the storage of refuse, parking and further noise being created between the floors, including mitigation and organisational strategies, it is considered that the amenity of both existing and future occuipers could be adversely impacted through the intensification of the use, not complying with Policies DMHB 11 and DMH 5 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The proposed development would provide low quality living conditions for future occupiers, in terms of the provision of internal amenity space and overall ceiling height.  The proposal would therefore conflict with Policy DMHB 16 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy D6 and Table 3.1 of the London Plan (2021), the Housing Standards Minor Alterations to The London Plan."
