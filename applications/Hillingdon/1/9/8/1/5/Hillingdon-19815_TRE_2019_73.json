    "The tree contributes to local biodiversity, and significantly contributes to the amenity and arboreal / wooded character of the Copsewood Estate Area of Special Local Character. The tree has a high amenity value.",
    "The applicant does not provide appropriate arboricultural reasons to justify the work. The tree appears to be in good health and pruning it would unnecessarily introduce multiple wounds into its crown, which would likely cause stress and lead to infection, affecting its long-term health; this would affect the safe useful life expectancy of the tree. Pruning would also result",
