    "The proposed development, by reason of its depth, proximity, bulk and mass would be harmful to the amenities of the occupiers of No 53 Wentworth Crescent, causing a harmful loss of outlook, loss of light and sense of enclosure, all contrary to Policies DMHD1 and DMHB11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two (2020).",
    "The development, by reason of its design, bulk, width, massing and roof form would fail to respect the architectural integrity of the host building, reading as an incongruous addition to the building and wider area, failing to read as a subordinate form of development, contrary to Policies DMHD1 and DMHB11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two (2020).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
