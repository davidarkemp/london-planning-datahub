    "The development hereby permitted shall be completed in accordance with the following supporting documents that have been submitted as part of this planning submission:",
    "- Covering Letter dated 24 June 2022",
    "- ICNIRP Certificate",

    "REASON",
    "To ensure the development complies with the provisions Hillingdon Local Plan Parts 1 (November 2012) and 2 (January 2020) and the London Plan (2021).",
    "The decision to GRANT planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to GRANT planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan and national guidance.",

    "The Applicant is advised that if a crane is needed for installation purposes, Heathrow Aerodrome would like to draw your attention to the following:",
    "Given the nature of the proposed development it is possible that a crane may be required during its construction. We would therefore, draw the applicants attention to the requirement within the British Standard Code of Practice for the safe use of Cranes, for crane operators to consult the aerodrome before erecting a crane in close proximity to an aerodrome. This is explained further in Advice Note 4 Cranes and Other Construction Issue (available at http://www.aoa.org.uk/policy-campaigns/operations-safety/ All crane applications should be sent to Heathrow's Works Approval Team via the following address: Airside_Works_Approvals@heathrow.com"
