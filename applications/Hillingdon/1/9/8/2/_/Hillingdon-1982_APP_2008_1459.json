    "The proposed front boundary wall by reason of its height and design, would fail to harmonise with existing front boundary walls in the street and as such would detract from the character and appearance of the street scene and the Hillingdon Court Park Area of Special Local Character, contrary to policies BE5, BE13 and BE19 of the adopted Hillingdon Unitary Development Plan (Saved Policies, September 2007) and section 10.0 of the Hillingdon Design & Accessibility Statement: 'Residential Extensions'.",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
