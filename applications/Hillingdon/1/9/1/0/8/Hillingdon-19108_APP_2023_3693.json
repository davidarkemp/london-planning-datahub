    "Due to its design, internal layout and close proximity to the street, Flat 1 of the proposed development would have habitable rooms with no privacy. For the same reasons and in the absence of a day and sunlight assessment the applicant has failed to demonstrate that the bedrooms of Flat 1 would be provided with acceptable levels of light. Taking into consideration these points, the development is considered to provide the future occupants of Flat 1 with poor, unsatisfactory and unacceptable internal living accommodation to the detriment of their amenities. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021), Policy DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020) and paragraph 135 (f) of the NPPF (2023).",
