    "The proposed first floor rear extension, by reason of its overall size, scale, bulk and crown roofed design design combined with the other additions to the property, would result in an incongruous addition which would be detrimental to the architectural composition of the existing building and would harm the character and appearance of the wider area. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policies DMHB 11,  DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two (2020), Policies D4 and D8 of the London Plan (2021) and the Chapter 13 of the NPPF (2024).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
