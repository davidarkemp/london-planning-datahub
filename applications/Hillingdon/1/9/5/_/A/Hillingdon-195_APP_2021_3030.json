    "The development hereby permitted shall not be carried out except in complete accordance with the details shown on submitted plan numbers 215 - Proposed Max Config Site Plan Issue D and 265 - Proposed Max Config Elevation Issue D. Thereafter the development shall be retained/maintained in accordance with the approved plans for as long as it exists.",

The applicant must ensure that the proposed works do not infringe on legal rights of access and or restrictive covenants that exist. If buildings or structures are proposed directly above the apparatus the development may only take place following diversion of the apparatus. The applicant should apply online to have apparatus diverted in advance of any works, by visiting cadentgas.com/diversions Prior to carrying out works, including the construction of access points, please register on www.linesearchbeforeudig.co.uk to submit details of the planned works for review, ensuring requirements are adhered to.",
