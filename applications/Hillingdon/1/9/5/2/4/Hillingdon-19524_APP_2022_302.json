  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed front dormer, by reason of its siting in this visually prominent position, size, scale, bulk, and design, would result in an incongruous and top heavy roof addition which would fail to respect the original roof form, established hierarchy of windows and architectural composition of the dwelling. The proposal would therefore be harmful to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the host property, street scene and the wider area, all contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2021). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020."
