    "The proposed part two storey, part single storey side/rear extension, by virtue of its excessive scale, bulk, and design  would fail to respect the architectural integrity of the original semi-detached dwelling and would result in an incongruous addition to this locally listed building which lies within a prominent position in the North Uxbridge Area of Special Local Character. The proposal would be contrary to policies BE1 and HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan (November 2012)  and policies DMHB5, DMHB11, DMHB12 and DMHD1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan - Part Two (2020).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service."
