    "The proposed single storey rear extension by reason of its excessive depth, height, bulk and scale would result in an incongruous addition which fails to read as a subordinate addition to the host dwelling. The proposal would therefore represent an overdevelopment of the site, harmful to the character and appearance of the building and wider area. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHD 1, DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. The Council's supports discussions regarding the application. We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
