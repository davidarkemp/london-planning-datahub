    "The proposed extensions, in particular the two-storey side element by reason of the general expanse of the roof form to the rear which would diminish an existing gap and would be result in an excessive, bulky, dominant, overbearing and visually intrusive form of development that would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original dwelling, would be detrimental to the character, appearance and symmetry of the small terrace of properties of which it forms a part and to the visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",

As such, the proposal would be contrary to Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The proposed terrace/raised platform, by reason of the siting, size, proximity and overall height would give rise to substantial overlooking and privacy concerns to the amenities of the adjoining occupiers at no.12 and 16 Bawtree Road.  As such, the proposal would be contrary to Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
