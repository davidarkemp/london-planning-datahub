  "description": "Two storey side and rear extension",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed part two storey, part single storey rear extension by reason of its overall size, scale, bulk, excessive width and design, including a substantial crown roof element, would be an overly-dominant and incongruous development which would be detrimental to the architectural composition of the original dwelling and to the character, appearance and the visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies.",
    "The proposal, by virtue of its size, scale, bulk, height and proximity, would be detrimental to the amenities of the adjoining occupier at 66 Providence Road, by reason of over-dominance, overshadowing, visual intrusion and loss of outlook. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies.",
    "The proposed development results in the loss of existing parking provision and fails to provide acceptable alternative off street parking provision for the extended property and therefore the development is considered to be deficient in car parking provision with regard to the Council adopted car parking standards resulting in on-street parking, in an area where such parking is at a premium, to the detriment of public and highway safety, contrary to Policy DMT 6 and Appendix C of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the 'Saved' UDP 2007, Local Plan Part 1, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
