    "The proposed development, by reason of its height, size, scale, appearance and siting of the proposed lattice mast would create an obtrusive form of development which would add visual clutter to the street scene and would have a negative impact upon the visual amenity and openness of the Metropolitan Green Belt as well as the setting of nearby listed buildings/structures. As such, the proposal would not harmonise with the character of the area and would be detrimental to local visual amenities, contrary to Policies BE1, HE1 and EM2 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 1, DMHB 2, DMHB 11, DMHB 12, DMHB 21 and DMEI 4 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policies 7.8 and 7.16 of the London Plan (2016) and the NPPF.",
    "In the absence of a Tree Survey and Arboricultural Implication Assessment to BS5837:2012 standards, the application has failed to demonstrate that the development will safeguard existing trees on the site and further fails to demonstrate protection for and long-term retention of the trees. The proposal is therefore detrimental to the visual amenity of the street scene and the wider area contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policy DMHB 14 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies.",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan - The Spatial Development Strategy for London consolidated with alterations since 2011 (2016) and national guidance."
