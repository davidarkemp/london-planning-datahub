    "The proposed rear dormer, by reason of its excessive size, scale and bulk, coupled with its siting and design, appears as an incongruous and visually obtrusive form of development which significantly detracts from the original form of the property and the symmetry of the adjoining semi-detached property at number 30 St. Margarets Road. Consequently, the proposal would cause significant harm to the character ,appearance and visual amenities of the host property and the surrounding area, contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local",
