    "The Pine and the Douglas Fir are situated within the front garden of 33 The Greenway. These trees present mature and attractive crowns which can be viewed from multiple corners within the Greenway. The pair of trees has a high amenity value, therefore making a significant positive contribution to the appearance of the local landscape.",
    "The Pine and the Douglas Fir are both in good condition. We are committed to maintaining the mature tree cover throughout the borough. Although we understand the need to plant species for the benefit of Bees and other pollinators, the removal on two mature, healthy trees to enable this is not the solution.",
    "Having regard to the reasons given for the proposed work, the work is unjustified and will have a detrimental impact on the visual amenity and arboreal character of the area.",
    "The removal of deadwood, dangerous / hanging branches and ivy:  This does not require the formal consent of the Council."
