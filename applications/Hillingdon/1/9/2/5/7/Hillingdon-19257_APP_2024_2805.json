    "The cumulative works and extensions to the dwelling, including the addition of the dormer, roof extension, ground floor extension and porch, by virtue of its design, size, scale and bulk fails to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original dwelling and would be detrimental to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the street scene and would result in less than substantial harm to the setting and significance of the Conservation Area that would not be outweighed by the public benefits of the development. The proposal would therefore conflict with Policies HE1 and BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies; Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12, DMHB 1 and DMHB 4 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020); Policies D4 and HC1 of the London Plan 2021; and Paragraphs 139 and 215 of the NPPF 2024.",
    "Given the orientation, projection and scale of the rear extension, it is considered that the development results in overshadowing, a sense of enclosure and an overbearing impact on the ground floor habitable room at No 85 Freemans Lane. The extension would read as a visually intrusive addition when viewed from the rear aspect of this property and would result in a loss of the daylight, sunlight and outlook levels currently enjoyed. Therefore, the single storey rear extension, by reason of its size, scale and siting is considered to be an overbearing structure that overshadows the adjoining property  85 Freemans Lane resulting in a loss of the residential amenity and natural light and would therefore be contrary to Policies, BE1, DMHB 11, DMHB 12 DMHB 4 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination)."
