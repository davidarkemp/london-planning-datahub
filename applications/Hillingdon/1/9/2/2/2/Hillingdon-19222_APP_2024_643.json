    "The proposed development, by reason of its excessive size, scale, bulk, height, and design, would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original dwelling and would be detrimental to the character, appearance, and visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area. Therefore, the proposal would be contrary to Policy D3 of The London Plan (2021), Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012), and Policies DMHB 5, DMHB 11, DMHB 12, and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan - Part Two (2020).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
