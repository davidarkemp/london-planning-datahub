    "The Oak trees are all situated within the rear garden of 15 Nicholas Way. As a group they have a high amenity value and significantly contribute to the arboricultural character of the Copse Wood Estate an Area of Special Local Character (ASLC). They provide a gradual transition of mature tree cover between the dwellings in the copse wood estate and the nearby Ruislip woods National Nature Reserve (NNR). The benefit in amenity and biodiversity afforded by the trees is both present and future because they have the potential for long life expectancies.",
    "T23 on application is an Oak tree situated close to the property, there is scope for some pruning works to ensure the canopy is not interfering with the property (a new application would be needed for this and the resident may wish to discuss the specifications for this with an Arboricultural Consultant prior to submitting a new application) however a reduction by 6m is excessive and would introduce multiple large pruning wounds.
