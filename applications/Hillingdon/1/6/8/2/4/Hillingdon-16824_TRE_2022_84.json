    "The Oak trees are all situated within the rear garden of 15 Nicholas Way. As a group they have a high amenity value and significantly contribute to the arboricultural character of the Copse Wood Estate an Area of Special Local Character (ASLC). They provide a gradual transition of mature tree cover between the dwellings in the Copse Wood estate and the nearby Ruislip woods National Nature Reserve (NNR). The benefit in amenity and biodiversity afforded by the trees is both present and future because they have the potential for long life expectancies.",
    "Although some trees within the urban environment will require maintenance to them to avoid disruption to services, buildings and reduce risk to those within it, many are in a position where their normal growth and life cycle is entirely concurrent with their situation and to unnecessarily prune these trees would not only harm the amenity they provide to the area, but also add unnecessary injury to them which may cause dysfunction. I am of",
    "The removal of deadwood, dangerous / hanging branches and ivy:  This does not require the formal consent of the Council."
