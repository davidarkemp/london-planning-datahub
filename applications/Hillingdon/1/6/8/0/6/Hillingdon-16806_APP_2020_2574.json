  "decision_conditions": [
    "The rear dormer, by reason of its size, scale, bulk and design fails to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original dwelling and is detrimental to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area. Therefore the development is contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two-Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "The garage conversion by reason of the siting of the ground floor flank window, given its proximity to the side boundary, results in the provision of a habitable room with no outlook and limited levels of natural lighting that results in a substandard form of living accommodation and reliance upon artificial means of lighting which fails to satisfy sustainability and energy efficiency objectives and is detrimental to the amenities of current and future occupiers, contrary to Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and Policies 3.5 and 5.3 of the London Plan (March 2016).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then the Local Plan:Part 2-Development Management Policies, then London Plan Policies (2016)."
