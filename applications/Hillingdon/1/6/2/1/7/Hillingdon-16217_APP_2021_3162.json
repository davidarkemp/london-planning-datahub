    "The proposed development by reason of its combined height, width, depth, scale, design, massing and roof design would result in an excessive, bulky, dominant, visually intrusive and jarring, disproportionate, incongruous and overbearing addition that would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original dwelling, relationship with the detached neighbouring bungalows of which it forms a part and would be detrimental to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the street scene. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012) and Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2016). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020."
