    "Due to its siting, design, excessive width, and resulting bulk, the proposed dwelling would form a visually unsympathetic addition to the neighbouring semi detached dwelling. It would also disrupt and unbalance the visual symmetry which exists between the pair and result in excessive hard landscaping to the front. The proposed dwelling would therefore be detrimental to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the streetscene and wider area, disrupting the established pattern of built form in the area. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), as well as policies D3 and D6 of the London Plan and  paragraphs 130 (a) and (c) of the NPPF (2021).",
    "The proposed development results in a dwelling of poor design as the new dwelling would provide a 3 bedroom property without a double/twin bedroom (11.5m2 floorspace). The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021) and fails to provide quality accommodation for future occupiers.",
    "The internal arrangement of the dwelling would fail to meet the requirements for a M4(2) accessible and adaptable dwelling as set out in Approved Document M to the Building Regulations (2015 edition). The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy D7 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan (2021) and NPPF (2021).",
    "This is a reminder that Under the terms of the Planning Act 2008 (as amended) and Community Infrastructure Levy Regulations 2010 (as amended), should an application for appeal be allowed, the proposed development would be deemed as 'chargeable development' and therefore liable to pay the London Borough of Hillingdon Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and the Mayor of London's Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This would be calculated in accordance with the London Borough of Hillingdon CIL Charging Schedule 2014 and the Mayor of London's CIL Charging Schedule 2012.",
