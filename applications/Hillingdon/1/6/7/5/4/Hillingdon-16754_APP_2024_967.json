    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate that the proposal and the high number of potential occupants would not result in noise and general disturbance to neighbouring properties alongside a harmful over-intensification of the use of the site, detrimental to both the occupiers and neighbouring properties and the residential amenity of the area. The proposal is, therefore, contrary to Paragraph 135 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023), Policies D3 and D13 of The London Plan (2021), and Policies DMH 5, DMHB 11, and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The proposal has not demonstrated that sufficient off-street parking/manoeuvring/access arrangements would be provided. Therefore, the development is considered to result in substandard car parking provision and would increase the pressure for on-street parking bays, exacerbate injudicious and unsafe highway conditions, and restrict the free flow of traffic. The proposal would, therefore, be contrary to Policies T2, T4, T6, and T6.1 of the London Plan (2021) and Policies DMT1, DMT2, and DMT6 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The proposal has failed to provide adequate cycle parking provision in accordance with the Council's adopted standards, contrary to Paragraph 135 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023), Policy T6 of the London Plan (2021), and Policies DMT 5 and DMH 5 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal.",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan (2021) and National Planning Policy Framework (2023)."
