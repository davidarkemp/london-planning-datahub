    "The first floor side/rear extension, by virtue of the overall size, bulk, design and position to the side of the existing sloping/catslide roof, would be highly visible from the immediate street scene, would substantially alter the existing roof form and would fail to appear as a subordinate addition to the application property. The visually intrusive form of development would fail to respect the architectural composition of the existing dwelling house  and to the character and appearance of the immediate street scene and the surrounding area. The proposed development thereby fails to comply with Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One- Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020)."
