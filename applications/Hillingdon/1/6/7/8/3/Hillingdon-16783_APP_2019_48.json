    "The roof alteration/extensions including the first floor side extension, by reason of the the size, scale, bulk, height and design including the rear dormer window, would result in an incongruous addition in this open prominent position, which would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original semi-detached dwelling and would be detrimental to the character, appearance and symmetry of the pair of semi-detached houses of which it forms a part and to the visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies BE13, BE15 and BE19 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Unitary Development Plan Saved Policies (November 2012) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document HDAS: Residential Extensions.",
