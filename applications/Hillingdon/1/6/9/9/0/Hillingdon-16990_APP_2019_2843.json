    "By reason of the proposed use of K render and the modern character of the roller shutter, the materials are inappropriate for use in the conservation area and would thus fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original dwelling, in this visually prominent corner location and would thus result in incongruous additions, to the detriment of the visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area. Therefore the proposal would fail to preserve or enhance the character of the Greenway Conservation Area, contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies BE4, BE13, BE15,  BE19  and PT1.HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Unitary Development Plan Saved Policies (November 2012), Policy DMHB 4 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies With Modifications (March 2019) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document HDAS: Residential Extensions.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the 'Saved' UDP 2007, Local Plan Part 1, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "We have been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
