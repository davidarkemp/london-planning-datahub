    "Due to its size, bulk, scale and proximity to the shared boundary, the proposed extensions would form a disproportionate and overly dominant addition to the host dwelling which would fail to respect its original size or architectural composition, subsequently causing harm to its character and appearance. Furthermore due to the design and prominent corner plot location, the resulting property would appear unduly prominent and overdeveloped when viewed from the street scene, causing significant harm to the character and appearance of Sipson Road, Keats Way and the surrounding area. The proposed development is therefore considered to be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHD 1, DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020) and paragraphs 130 (a) and (c) of the NPPF (2021)."
