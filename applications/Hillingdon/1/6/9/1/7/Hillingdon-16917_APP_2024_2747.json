    "Due to its design (which includes side windows) and siting, the proposed extension would provide direct, short distance views into the rear windows and patio area of No.51 Falling Lane leading to a harmful loss of privacy. It is therefore considered that the proposed development would have an adverse impact on the amenities of the occupiers of No.51 Falling Lane. The development is therefore contrary to Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), as well as Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021) and paragraph 135 (f) of the NPPF 2024.",
    "Direct and short distance views would be provided from the rear garden and patio area of No.51 Falling Lane into the proposed sun room leading to a harmful loss of privacy to its users (occupiers of No.49 Falling Lane). The proposed development is therefore contrary to Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021) and paragraph 135 (f) of the NPPF 2024.",
    "The proposed single storey rear extension would be attached to an existing extension. Due to its cumulative depth and size the extension would form a disproportionate addition to the original dwelling which fails to respect its original size, as well as the general pattern of development in the area which comprises smaller extensions. Due to its design the proposed extension would also fail to visually integrate with the existing house and existing extension. The proposal would therefore be detrimental to the character and appearance of the original dwelling and area, contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One Strategic (2012) and Policies DMHD 1, DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), as well as Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021) and paragraph 135 (b), (c) and (d) of the NPPF 2024.",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan (2021) and NPPF (2024)."
