    "The proposed extensions, by virtue of their excessive scale, width, bulk and crown roofed design, would fail to appear as subordinate additions to the host dwelling and would result in an incongruous addition to the streetscene which lies within the North Uxbridge ASLC.  As such the proposal conflicts with Policy BE 1 and HE 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan (November 2012) ; Policies DMHB 5; DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan - Part Two (2020) and Policies D3 and D6 of the London Plan (2021).",

We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service."
