  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposal results in the loss of this non-designated employment site and fail to provide sufficient justification for the loss. The proposal is, therefore, contrary to Policy E1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policy DME 2 of the of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "The proposed development by reason of its siting, size, scale, bulk, design and mixture of external finishes would be detrimental to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the street scene and the wider area and would cause harm to the setting of the adjoining non-designated heritage asset. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policies BE1 and HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 3, DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), Policies 3.5, 7.4 and 7.8 of the London Plan (2016) and the NPPF.",
    "The proposal would provide an overall indoor living area of an unsatisfactory size for the future occupiers of the proposed 1 bedroom units and would therefore give rise to a substandard form of living accommodation to the detriment of the amenity of future occupiers. The proposal is thus contrary to Policy DMHB 16 of the adopted Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), Policy 3.5 and Table 3.3 of the London Plan (2016), the Housing Standards Minor Alterations to The London Plan (March 2016), the Mayor of London's adopted Supplementary Planning Guidance - Housing (March 2016) and the Technical Housing Standards - Nationally Described Space Standard (March 2015).",
    "The proposed development, by virtue of its failure to provide amenity space of sufficient size and quality commensurate to the size and layout of the first and second floor units, would result in an over-development of the site detrimental to the residential amenity of existing and future occupiers. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies DMHB 11 and DMHB 18 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "The proposed development, by virtue of its size, scale, bulk, height and proximity, would be detrimental to the amenities of the adjoining occupier at 903 Uxbridge Road by reason of overdominance, overshadowing, visual intrusion and loss of outlook. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policy DMHB 11 of the adopted Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The proposal has not demonstrated that sufficient off street parking/manoeuvring arrangements would be provided, and therefore the development is considered to result in substandard car parking provision, leading to on-street parking/queuing to the detriment of public and highway safety and contrary to policies DMT 2 and DMT 6 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020) and to Hillingdon's Adopted Parking Standards as set out in Appendix C of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "The proposal has not demonstrated that the proposed development would be accessible, giving rise to a substandard form of living accommodation to the detriment of the amenity of future occupiers. The proposal is thus contrary to Policy DMHB 11 of the adopted Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), Policy 3.8 of the London Plan (2016) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document HDAS: Accessible Hillingdon.",
    "This is a reminder that Under the terms of the Planning Act 2008 (as amended) and Community Infrastructure Levy Regulations 2010 (as amended), should an application for appeal be allowed, the proposed development would be deemed as 'chargeable development' and therefore liable to pay the London Borough of Hillingdon Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and the Mayor of London's Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This would be calculated in accordance with the London Borough of Hillingdon CIL Charging Schedule 2014 and the Mayor of London's CIL Charging Schedule 2012. For more information on CIL matters please visit the planning portal page at: www.planningportal.gov.uk/planning/applications/howtoapply/whattosubmit/cil",

We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service."
