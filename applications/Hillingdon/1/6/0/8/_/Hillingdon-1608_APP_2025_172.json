    "Overall, the cumulative impact of the proposal, particularly the first floor side and rear extension which has an awkward roof form and is excessive in overall width and depth, would fail to respect the architectural composition of the original dwelling and would result in harm to the character and appearance of the dwelling. Given the situation of the dwelling and the gap between the neighbouring dwellings given the bend in the road, the side and rear extension would be visually prominent within the street scene and the roof form would result in harm to the visual amenities of the area. Therefore, the proposal fails to comply with Policies BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHD 1, DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021) and Chapter 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service. We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
