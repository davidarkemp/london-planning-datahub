The Hornbeam (T8 on application) is within the neighbours wooded area and as a result has a moderate amenity value. All the trees significantly contribute to the arboreal character of the Copse Wood Estate (Area of Special Local Character). The trees also contribute to local biodiversity and form part of the area of mature, protected trees that help to provide a gradual transition of mature tree cover between the dwellings in the Copsewood Estate and the nearby Ruislip woods National Nature Reserve (NNR). Apart from T3 on application (oak) the benefit in amenity and biodiversity afforded by these trees is both present and future because they have the potential for a long life expectancy.",

This work shall comprise a reduction in the length of the limb(s) in a uniform and systematic manner and the limb(s) should be cut back to suitably positioned secondary branches.",

The Arboricultural Association can provide details of its approved contractors, who have demonstrated such professionalism and competence, on their website (www.trees.org.uk) or by calling 01242 522152.
