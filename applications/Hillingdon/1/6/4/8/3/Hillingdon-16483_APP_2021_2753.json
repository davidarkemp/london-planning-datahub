    "The proposed development would result in the loss of employment floor space which would undermine the local economy.  No marketing evidence has been submitted to indicate that the local and physical condition of the building renders it unsuitable for employment purposes. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy DME 2 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The proposed development by reason of its backland location, size, scale, bulk, massing, height and design would result in an incongruous and visually obtrusive form of development. The proposal would therefore cause significant harm to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the surrounding area and the wider Old Northwood Area of Special Local Character. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies BE1 and HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One -Strategic Policies (2012), Policies DMHB 5, DMHB 11, DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020), Policies HC1, D1, D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The proposed development, by virtue of its proximity, scale, size, bulk, massing, height and design and the inclusion of rear terraces, would cause harm to the living conditions of the neighbouring occupiers of the first floor flats at numbers 40 to 44 High Street and the neighbouring residential occupiers at numbers 57 to 65 Hilliard Road and their associated private amenity space, in terms of outlook, light, privacy, overlooking, overbearing impact and sense of enclosure. The proposal therefore conflicts with Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One -Strategic Policies (2012), Policy DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The proposed development, by virtue of its poor outlook, poor levels of natural light and lack of privacy would result in substandard forms of residential accommodation to the detriment of future occupants. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy DMHB 16 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The proposed development, by reason of its inadequate size, quality and functionality of external amenity space provision, would result in substandard forms of residential accommodation to the detriment of future occupants. The proposal therefore conflicts with Policy DMHB 18 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The proposed development would introduce a more vulnerable use (i.e. residential accommodation) on land within a high risk area for surface water flooding.  No Flood Risk Assessment has been provided and no sequential test has been carried out. Consequently, insufficient information has been submitted regarding the risk and effects of flooding at the site, and the availability of alternative sites in areas with a lower risk of flooding. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy DMEI 9 and DMEI 10 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020),  Policies SI 12 and SI 13 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The proposed development would not provide any three or more bedroom (family sized) units. Robust justification has not been provided to demonstrate that the provision of family sized units would be unsuitable or unviable. The proposal would therefore not provide a suitable mix of housing to support sustainable, inclusive and mixed communities, contrary to Policy DMH 2 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy H10 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The proposed development, by virtue of the absence of any lift provision and the lack of details to show that the internal layout would comply with Building Regulation requirement M4(2) and M4(3), fails to demonstrate that adequate provision would be provided to meet the needs of people with disabilities. The proposed development therefore conflicts with Policies D5 and D7 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "It has not been demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority that the on-site car parking provision could be realistically and feasibly delivered given that the vehicle access leading to the site falls outside of the site curtilage (i.e. red line boundary). In the absence of on-site car parking provision, the proposal would cause unacceptable street parking stress, which in turn, would lead to highway safety issues. The proposal therefore conflicts with Policies DMT1, DMT 2 and DMT 6 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2- Development Management Policies (2020), Policies T6 and T6.1 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The proposal fails to demonstrate how the development would achieve the highest standards of fire safety in regard to its design in incorporating appropriate features which reduce the risk to life in the event of a fire, its construction methods, means of escape, strategy for evacuation and providing suitable access and equipment for firefighting appropriate for the size and residential nature of the development. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies D5 and D12 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "This is a reminder that Under the terms of the Planning Act 2008 (as amended) and Community Infrastructure Levy Regulations 2010 (as amended), should an application for appeal be allowed, the proposed development would be deemed as 'chargeable development' and therefore liable to pay the London Borough of Hillingdon Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and the Mayor of London's Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This would be calculated in accordance with the London Borough of Hillingdon CIL Charging Schedule 2014 and the Mayor of London's CIL Charging Schedule 2012.",
    "For more information on CIL matters please visit the planning portal page at: www.planningportal.gov.uk/planning/applications/howtoapply/whattosubmit/cil",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan (2021) and national guidance."
