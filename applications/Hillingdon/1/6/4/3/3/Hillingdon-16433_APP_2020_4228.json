    "The proposed extension, by reason of its excessive depth when taken in conjunction with the previously approved & constructed rear extension, would fail to appear as a subordinate addition to the original dwelling and would thus fail to harmonise with the character and appeerance of the original dwelling and the wider area. The proposal would therefore represent an over development of the site to the detriment of the character and appearance and visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area, contrary to Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2016). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020."
