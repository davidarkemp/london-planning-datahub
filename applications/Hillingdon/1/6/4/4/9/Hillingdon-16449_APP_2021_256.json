    "The proposed 4 bedroom dwellinghouse would, by virtue of its failure to maintain an adequate amount of private usable external amenity space for the occupiers of the property, result in an over-development of the site detrimental to the residential amenity of the existing occupiers. The proposal is therefore contrary to policies DMHD1, DMHB18 and DMHB11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan - Part Two (2020).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service."
