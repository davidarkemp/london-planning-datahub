  "decision_conditions": [
    "TThe mature English Oak (within G8) is situated on the north-east corner of the property in the front garden and has a moderate amenity value. It is also located within the Hillingdon Court Park area of special local character.",
    "This English Oak  is approximately 18.2m tall, has a crown spread of approximately 14m and stands about 10.7m away from the main property. This tree is visible from all sides and is more especially visible from the east and south making a good contribution to the visual amenity and arboreal character of the local area. It is also an important member of a group of Oak trees which are important for their cohesion in the local landscape and is highly valuable for biodiversity.",
    "It is not considered that there is enough evidence provided which justifies the removal of ths mature Oak tree and proves that it is responsible for the alleged damage. Level monitoring has only been undertaken for approximately 10 months, so more level monitoring results over a longer peri",
    "The removal of deadwood, dangerous / hanging branches and ivy:  This does not require the formal consent of the Council."
