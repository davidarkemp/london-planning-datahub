  "description": "Erection of a two storey, 6 bed dwelling with habitable roofspace including 2 front and 3 rear dormers and 2 balconies with associated parking and amenity space including demolition of existing dwelling",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed development, by reason of its siting, layout, size, scale, bulk and design would result in a development of the site, which would fail to harmonise with the existing local and historic context of the surrounding area. It would have a detrimental impact on the character, appearance and visual amenities of the street scene and the wider Copsewood Estate, Northwood Area of Special Local Character. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies HE1 and BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 1, DMHB 5, DMHB 6, DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the adopted Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), Policies 3.5, 7.1, 7.4 and 7.8 of the London Plan (2016), guidance within The London Plan Housing Supplementary Planning Guidance (March 2016) and the NPPF.",
    "The proposed development by virtue of its size, scale, bulk, height and proximity, would be detrimental to the amenities of the adjoining occupier at Cobwebs, Oak Glade by reason of overdominance, visual intrusion and loss of outlook. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policy DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies.",
    "The proposed development, by virtue of the planned cumulative future impact on trees protected by TPO 398 fails to satisfy policies DMHB 11 and DMHB 14 of the adopted Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020),",
    "The proposed dwelling, by reason of its design and layout fails to provide a dwelling which meets the requirements of people with disabilities and would therefore give rise to a substandard form of living accommodation to the detriment of the amenity of future occupiers. The proposal is thus contrary to Policy 3.8 of the London Plan (2016).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2016). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020.",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan - The Spatial Development Strategy for London consolidated with alterations since 2011 (2016) and national guidance."
