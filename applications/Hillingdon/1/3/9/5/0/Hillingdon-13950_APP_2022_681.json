    "The proposed development, by reason of its siting, bulk, height, design and appearance would fail to successfully integrate and harmonise with the architectural composition of the existing dwelling. The proposal would fail to represent good design and would unbalance the roofline of the existing property, as well as make the roof appear unduly top heavy and oversized. As a whole the development would be detrimental to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the street scene and the Area of Special Local Character and would therefore be contrary to Policies HE1 and BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies, DMHB 5, DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "The proposal would result in the provision of habitable rooms with limited and/or no natural lighting and no meaningful outlook that would result in a substandard form of living accommodation which would fail to satisfy sustainability and energy efficiency objectives and would be to the detriment of the amenity of future occupiers, contrary to Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and Policies D6 and SI2 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "The proposed balcony would result in an unacceptable level of overlooking and harmful loss of privacy to 14 South Drive and its private rear garden, contrary to Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020)."
