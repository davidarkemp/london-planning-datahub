    "The development hereby permitted shall not be carried out except in complete accordance with the details shown on the submitted plan number P/MAC/2023/002/D",
    "REASON",
    "To ensure the development complies with the provisions of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020), and the London Plan (2021).",
    "The materials to be used in the construction of the external surfaces of the development hereby permitted shall match those used in the existing building and shall thereafter be retained as such, unless otherwise stated on the plans.",
    "REASON",
    "To safeguard the visual amenities of the area and to ensure that the proposed development does not have an adverse effect upon the appearance of the existing building in accordance with Policy DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 (2020)",
    "The outbuilding hereby approved shall only be used for the purpose(s) stated on the approved drawings, namely as a home office, pool room, boiler room(s) and gym. It shall not be used for purposes such as a living room, bedroom, kitchen, or as a separate unit of accommodation.",
    "REASON",
    "To avoid any future fragmentation of the curtilage or the creation of a separate residential or business use, so as to protect the amenity of adjoining residential properties in accordance with Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 18, DMHD 2 and DMT 6 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "The external noise level emitted from plant, machinery or equipment at the development hereby approved shall be lower than the lowest existing background noise level by at least 5dBA, by 10dBA where the source is tonal, as assessed according to BS4142:2014 at the nearest and/or most affected noise sensitive premises, with all machinery operating together at maximum capacity.",
    "REASON",
    "To safeguard the amenity of the surrounding area in accordance with Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2: Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "The site lies in a Critical Drainage Area (CDA) as identified in the Surface Water Management Plan (SWMP) for Hillingdon. A CDA is the catchment area from which surface water drains and contributes to drainage problems. All developments in this area must contribute to managing the risk of flooding from surface water by reducing surface water runoff from the site. Therefore the applicant should minimise the water from your site entering the sewers. No drainage to support the extension should be connected to any existing surface water sewer, other than as an overflow. Water run off from any roof or hard paving associated with  e development should be directed to a soakaway, or tank or made permeable. This includes any work to front gardens not part of the planning application, which must be permeable or be collected and directed to a permeable area, otherwise it would need an additional permission. A water butt should be incorporated.",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2021). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020."
