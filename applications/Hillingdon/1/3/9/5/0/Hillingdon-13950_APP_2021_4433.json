    "The proposed single storey side extension, in conjunction with the existing extension, by reason of its siting, size, scale, bulk and cumulative width, would result in an incongruous form of development that would fail to appear subordinate to the main dwelling and respect the design and appearance of the original house, detrimental to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the streetscene, surrounding area, and wider Midcroft, Ruislip Area of Special Local Character.  The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policies BE1 and HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHD 1, DMHB 1, DMHB 5, DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), Policy HC1 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2016). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020."
