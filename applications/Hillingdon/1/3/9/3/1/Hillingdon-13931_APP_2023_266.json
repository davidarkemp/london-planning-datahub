    "The proposal constitutes inappropriate development in the Green Belt.  The material change of use of the Public House's car park to a proposed car wash would not preserve the openness of the Green Belt. The operational development, associated with the proposed car wash, which includes the erection of an office building and canopies,  would have a greater impact on openness than the existing car park. There are no other considerations which would clearly outweigh the harm to the Green Belt. The very special circumstances necessary to the justify the proposed development does not, therefore, exist. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policy DMEI 4 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy G2 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "By virtue of their prominent siting, size, scale, height, the proposed canopies, together with the proposed office building, would appear as unattractive features that would be completely out of character with the rural setting of the site and the surrounding Widewater Lock",
    "Conservation Area. Furthermore, the proposed development would introduce intensified commercial activity and associated paraphernalia which would be detrimental to the site's rural character, as well as negatively affecting the setting of the Widewater Lock",
    "Conservation Area. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policies BE1 and HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One- Strategic Policies (2012), Policies DMHB 1, DMHB 4, DMHB 11, DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policies HC1, D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021), and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "Insufficient evidence has been submitted to demonstrate that the proposed car wash, noting its proximity, intensification of the use of the site, and associated noise and disturbance, would not undermine the function and features (including the outdoor seating area) that are important to The Bear on the Barge Public House to attract custom. Consequently, there is a realistic likelihood that the proposal would  jeopardise the success of the Public House as a business to the extent that it would result in the loss of this community facility. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policy DMC 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy HC7 of the London Plan (2021) and paragraph 93 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "a) We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal.",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan - The Spatial Development Strategy for London consolidated with alterations since 2011 (2016) and national guidance."
