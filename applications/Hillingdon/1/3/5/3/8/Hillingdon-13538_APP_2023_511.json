The proposal would therefore not accord with the requirements of paragraph AA.1.(h), Class AA, Schedule 2, Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "The proposed development would adversely impact on the amenity of the neighbouring occupiers at number 10 Lees Road, in terms of loss of outlook, light, sense of enclosure and overbearing impact.  The proposal would therefore not constitute permitted development under the terms of paragraph AA.2.(3)(a)(i), Class AA, Schedule 2, Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
