    "The proposed two storey side extension cumulatively with the proposed roof extension, by reason of their design, size, position and bulk, would result in an incongruous form of development that would not appear as a subordinate addition to the original dwellinghouse and visually unbalance the pair of semi-detached dwellings of which it forms part, to the detriment of the character, appearance and visual amenities of the street scene and surrounding area. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHD 1,  DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021) and Chapter 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021)."
