    "The proposed dwelling would not follow the existing character, appearance and architectural composition of the local area. Its elevational treatment, including large areas of glazing and a flat roof design, would have a modern appearance which would be completely out of keeping with the character, appearance and architectural composition of the site, the street scene and the local area. The proposal therefore conflicts with  Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021), Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMEI 6 and DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2: Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "In overall terms the proposed development is considered to have greater impact on the openness of the Green Belt in terms of its width, depth and overall area, extending to being materially larger than the existing building and would therefore as currently presented as inappropriate development and contrary to the requirements of Policy DMEI 4 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy G2 of the London Plan (2021) and Paragraph 148 of the NPPF. The resulting harm to the openness, in visual and spatial terms, is readily apparent and there are no very special circumstances.",
    "In the absence of a full ecological assessment relevant to the description of development, the applicant has failed to demonstrate that the development would not affect ecology and biodiversity. The development therefore conflicts with Policy DMEI 7 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and Policy G6 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "No development approved by this permission shall be commenced until a scheme for the provision of sustainable water management has been submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority.  The scheme shall clearly demonstrate that sustainable drainage systems (SUDS) have been incorporated into the designs of the development in accordance with the hierarchy set out in accordance with Policy SI5 of the London Plan and will:",
    "i.        provide information about the design storm period and intensity, the method employed to delay and control the surface water discharged from the site and the measures taken to prevent pollution of the receiving groundwater and/or surface waters;",
    "ii.        include a timetable for its implementation; and",
    "iii.        provide a management and maintenance plan for the lifetime of the development which shall include the arrangements for adoption by any public authority or statutory undertaker and any other arrangements to secure the operation",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan - The Spatial Development Strategy for London consolidated with alterations since 2011 (2016) and national guidance.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "a) We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal.",
    "This is a reminder that Under the terms of the Planning Act 2008 (as amended) and Community Infrastructure Levy Regulations 2010 (as amended), should an application for appeal be allowed, the proposed development would be deemed as 'chargeable development' and therefore liable to pay the London Borough of Hillingdon Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and the Mayor of London's Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This would be calculated in accordance with the London Borough of Hillingdon CIL Charging Schedule 2014 and the Mayor of London's CIL Charging Schedule 2012.",
