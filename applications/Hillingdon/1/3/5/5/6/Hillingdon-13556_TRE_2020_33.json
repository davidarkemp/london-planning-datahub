    "The mature, evergreen, Douglas Fir is a prominent and dominant landscape feature in this part of Pepys Close with a high amenity value. This tree makes a significant contribution to the arboreal character and amenity of Ickenham Village Conservation Area. The reasons on the application states \"During storm Ciara, they attended two snap outs and the tree was moving aggressivelyâ¿¦\" but they have answered \"No\" to the question 6.1 \"Condition of the tree e.g. â¿¦you have fears that it might break or fall\" and no technical evidence has been provided as to why \"moving aggressively\" in a storm condition is unnatural. Having regard to the reasons given for the proposed work, the work is unjustified and will have a detrimental impact on the visual amenity and arboreal character of the area.",
