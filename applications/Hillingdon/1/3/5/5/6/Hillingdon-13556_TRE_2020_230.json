  "description": "To carry out tree surgery including a reduction in height by 3m and a lateral reduction by up to 1.5m to One Douglas Fir T14 on TPO 5",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The mature, evergreen, Douglas Fir is a prominent and dominant landscape feature in this part of Pepys Close with a high amenity value. This tree makes a significant contribution to the arboreal character and amenity of Ickenham Village Conservation Area.",
    "The applicant has answered \"yes\" to the question 6.1 \"Condition of the tree e.g. â¿¦you have fears that it might break or fall\" however no technical evidence has been provided as to why  \"moving aggressively\" in a storm condition is unnatural.",
    "Having regard to the reasons given for the proposed work, the work is unjustified and will have a detrimental impact on the visual amenity and arboreal character of the area.",
    "The removal of deadwood, dangerous / hanging branches and ivy:  This does not require the formal consent of the Council.",
    "Expert assessment: The owner may wish to discuss their concerns in relation to the tree with an Arboricultural Consultant, they will be able to carry out a full assessment of the trees condition and discuss any questions they might have in terms of the condition, safety and management of the tree. A list of consultants can be found on the Arboricultural Association's website: www.trees.org.uk"
