  "decision_conditions": [
    "The mature, evergreen, Douglas Fir is a prominent and dominant landscape feature in this part of Pepys Close with a high amenity value. This tree makes a significant contribution to the arboreal character and amenity of Ickenham Village Conservation Area.",
    "Since 2011 this is the sixth application to either remove or carry out tree surgery to this Douglas Fir, within these decisions all work was refused apart from a crown lift to the height (apex) of the bungalow roof of 6 Pepys Close, there has also been reference in previous applications to specific branches removed following storm events however the tree has never received a full reduction. As a result, it is inaccurate to state the pruning regime (to contain its size) should continue. The report suggests the work should be completed to ensure that the tree does not cause any issues in the future, however the tree is a similar age to the properties and no cracks have been reported which suggests that the foundations of both dwellings",
    "The removal of deadwood, dangerous / hanging branches and ivy:  This does not require the formal consent of the Council."
