The proposal would therefore be detrimental to the visual amenities of the street scene and character and appearance of the surrounding area, contrary to Policies BE13 and BE19 of the Borough's adopted Unitary Development Plan and section 5.0 of the Hillingdon Design & Accessibility Statement (HDAS): 'Residential Extensions'.",
