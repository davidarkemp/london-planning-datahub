    "The  proposal  by reason of its excessive size, scale and bulk increased depth and positioning would represent an unduly intrusive and incongruous form of development which would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original dwelling. It would result in the loss of an important visual gap characteristic to the area which would erode openness of the dwelling in the context of the immediate neighbouring properties and therefore be detrimental to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area. Therefore, the proposed development would be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan (November 2012), Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan - Part Two (2020) and Policies D3 and D6 of the London Plan (2021).",

We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably.",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan - The Spatial Development Strategy for London consolidated with alterations since 2011 (2016) and national guidance."
