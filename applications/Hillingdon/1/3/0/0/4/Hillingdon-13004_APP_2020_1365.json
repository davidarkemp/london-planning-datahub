  "description": "Demolition of existing building and erection of a 3 storey replacement building comprising Class A uses on the ground floor and 8 residential units (6 x 1 bedroom and 2 x 2 bedroom) at first and second floor levels",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposal, by reason of its siting, size, scale, bulk, detailed design gives rise to an over-intensive use of the site with a site coverage and form of development which would be detrimental to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the street scene and would fail to either preserve or enhance the designated and non-designated heritage assets adjoining or the character or appearance of the surrounding Old Uxbridge/Windsor Street Conservation Area. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies BE1 and HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 1, DMHB 4, DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policies 7.4 and 7.8 of the London Plan (2016) and the NPPF.",
    "The proposed development by virtue of its size, scale, bulk, design and proximity, would be detrimental to the amenities of the neighbouring  occupiers at 9 Belmont road by reason of overdominance, visual intrusion, loss of outlook and loss of privacy. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policy DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The proposal, by reason of the very high proportion of single aspect units and the siting of habitable room windows to the flank, given their proximity to the flank wall of the adjoining buildings, would result in the provision of habitable rooms with very little/no outlook and limited levels of natural lighting that would result in a substandard form of living accommodation and reliance upon artificial means of lighting which would fail to satisfy sustainability and energy efficiency objectives and would be to the detriment of the amenity of future occupiers, contrary to Policies DMHB 11 and DMHB 16 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policies 3.5 and 5.3 of the London Plan (March 2016) and the Mayor of London's adopted Supplementary Planning Guidance - Housing (March 2016).",
    "The proposed development, by virtue of its failure to provide amenity space of sufficient size and quality commensurate to the size and layout of the said units would result in an over-development of the site detrimental to the residential amenity of existing and future occupiers. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy DMHB 18 of the emerging Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "In the absence of a Section 106 legal agreement, the proposed development fails to provide contributions towards the improvement of services and facilities as a consequence of demands created by the proposed development (in respect of highways works, highway contribution and Project Management and Monitoring) and also fails to agree to the restrictions of parking permits which is required in order to facilitate sustainable development. The developments therefore fails to provide adequate off street parking provision or demonstrate that the variance would not lead to a deleterious impact on street parking provision, congestion or local amenity. The scheme therefore conflicts with Policies DMT 1, DMT 2, DMT 6 and DMCI 7 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two Development management Policies (2020), the London Borough of Hillingdon Supplementary Planning Document on Planning Obligations, Policy DF1 of the London Plan Intend to Publish Version (2019), Policy 8.2 of the London Plan (2016) an",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Unitary Development Plan Saved Policies (September 2007) as incorporated into the Hillingdon Local Plan (2012) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan - The Spatial Development Strategy for London consolidated with alterations since 2011 (2016) and national guidance.",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant saved policies (referred to as policies from the Hillingdon Unitary Development Plan - Saved Policies September 2007), then London Plan Policies (2016).  On the 8th November 2012 Hillingdon's Full Council agreed the adoption of the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies. Appendix 5 of this explains which saved policies from the old Unitary Development (which was subject to a direction from Secretary of State in September 2007 agreeing that the policies were 'saved') still apply for development control decisions.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.  We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the  proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal.",
    "This is a reminder that Under the terms of the Planning Act 2008 (as amended) and Community Infrastructure Levy Regulations 2010 (as amended), should an application for appeal be allowed, the proposed development would be deemed as 'chargeable development' and therefore liable to pay the London Borough of Hillingdon Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and the Mayor of London's Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This would be calculated in accordance with the London Borough of Hillingdon CIL Charging Schedule 2014 and the Mayor of London's CIL Charging Schedule 2012.
