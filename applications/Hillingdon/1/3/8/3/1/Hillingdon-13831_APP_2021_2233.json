The car parking provision is in excess of the maximum parking standards contrary to The London Plan (2021) Policy T6), Policy DMT6 of The Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020), and paragraphs 104,110 and 112 of the NPPF (2021).",

This is contrary to Policies EM7 and EM8 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012),  Policies DMHB 11 and DMEI 7 of The Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020), Polices D14 and G6 of the London Plan (2021) and paragraphs 174 and 180 of the NPPF (2021) and the Noise Policy Statement for England 2010.",

Notwithstanding these discussions, the scheme was ultimately considered to fail to comply with the development plan for the reason identified above.",
