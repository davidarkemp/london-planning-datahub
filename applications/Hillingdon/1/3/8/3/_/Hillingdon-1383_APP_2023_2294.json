    "The proposed extension by reason of its overall depth and scale, design, materials and appearance, in conjunction with the existing rear extension, would fail to appear subordinate to the original property or respect its architectural composition and appearance, giving rise to a visually harmful, dominant and poorly designed form of development which would be detrimental to the character and appearance of the site and surrounding area. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), policies DMHB11 and DMHD1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan - Part One (2020), policy D3 of the London Plan (2021) and Chapter 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
