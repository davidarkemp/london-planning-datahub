    "The proposal would result in a row of three similarly designed blocks which would incorporate large mansard roofs with oversized dormers and would result in an extensive 50m wide frontage on Chester road, with only narrow, sub-standard undeveloped gaps to break up the building mass. As such, the proposal would add another incongruous building to this part of Chester Road, the cumulative impact of which would result in a very cramped and overdeveloped street scene. The proposal therefore fails to harmonise with the mixed architecture and spacious character and appearance of the Old Northwood Area of Special Local Character, contrary to Policies BE5, BE13, BE15, BE19 and BE22 of the adopted Hillingdon Unitary Development Plan Saved Policies (September 2007) and Policy DMHB5 of the draft Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies with Modifications (March 2019).",
    "The proposed development by reason of its scale, bulk and proximity to the side boundaries would result in a closing of the visually open gap between it and the neighbouring properties at both no. 34 and 28 Chester road which would give rise to a cramped form of development,  detrimental to the visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area and the character and appearance of the Old Northwood Area of Special Local Character,. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies BE5, BE13, BE15, BE19 and BE22 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Saved UDP Policies (November 2012) and Policy DMHB5 of the draft Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies with Modifications (March 2019).",
    "The proposed rearward element by virtue of its size, scale, siting, bulk and proximity to no. 34 Chester Road would be detrimental to the amenities of the adjoining occupiers at 34 Chester road by reason of over-dominance, overshadowing, visual intrusion, loss of daylight and sunlight and loss of outlook. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies BE13, BE19, BE20, BE22, BE24 and BE21 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Saved UDP Policies (November 2012) and Policy DMHB5 of the draft Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies with Modifications (March 2019).",
    "Due to the proximity of the proposed development to no.28 Chester road and the siting of the flank wall and the location of the proposed light wells serving the kitchen and activity lounge, the development would be detrimental to the amenities of the adjoining occupiers at 28 Chester Road by reason of outlook, noise, smell and odour and general disturbance. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies BE13, BE19, BE20, BE21, BE24 and BE22 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Saved UDP Policies (November 2012) and Policy DMHB5 of the draft Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies with Modifications (March 2019).",
    "The proposed development, in the absence of a Section 106 legal agreement fails to secure the development as C2 use class elderly accommodation. Given that a legal agreement to address this issue has not at this stage been offered or secured, the proposal is considered to be contrary to Policy R17 of the the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Saved UDP Policies (November 2012), DMCI 7 of the Hillingdon Revised Proposed Submission Version of the Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2019) , Policy DMH 8 of the Emerging Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 Development Management Policies and Policy 3.17 of the London Plan (2016).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Unitary Development Plan Saved Policies (September 2007) as incorporated into the Hillingdon Local Plan (2012) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan - The Spatial Development Strategy for London consolidated with alterations since 2011 (2016) and national guidance."
