    "The proposed front garden boundary treatment, railings and gates, by reason of their size, scale and design would significantly erode and detract from the verdant character and spacious appearance of the street scene and fail to preserve or enhance the appearance and character of the Greenway Conservation Area, contrary to Policies BE1 and HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012); Policies DMHB 1, DMHB 4, DMHB 6, DMHB 11, DMHB 12  and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020); Policy HC1 of the London Plan (2021); Paragraph 202 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021) and Section 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
