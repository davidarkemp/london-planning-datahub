    "The installation of rooflights on the side elevation of the two-storey side extension would not constitute permitted development under Class C of Part 1, Schedule 2 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended), as the planning permission (13746/APP/2014/845) for a  part two storey, part single storey side/rear extension  granted on appeal  and built is subject to a condition which restricts the insertion of any windows or openings in the side elevations without the prior written approval of the Local Planning Authority.",
    "The proposed rooflights would therefore be in breach of Condition 4 of the appeal decision (Ref: APP/R5510/D/14/2220009), and as such, planning permission would be required. No evidence has been provided that the window openings have been in situe for more than ten years and in the absence of such evidence, the Local Planning Authority is not satisfied that, on the balance of probabilities, the development is lawful"
