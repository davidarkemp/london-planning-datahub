  "description": "Part two storey, part single storey side/front extension, first floor front extension and part two storey, part first floor rear extension",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed two storey side extension, by reason of its size, scale, bulk, width and proximity to the side boundary, would result in a closing of the visually open gap between it and the neighbouring property, 26 Sweetcroft Lane, giving rise to a cramped form of development, would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original dwelling and would be detrimental to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies(2020).",
    "The proposed front, side and rear extensions, by reason of their siting, size, scale, bulk, width and design, would fail to appear as subordinate additions and would thus represent a visually unsympathetic form of development that fails to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original dwelling and would be detrimental to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the street scene and the wider area. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The proposed development by virtue of its overall size, scale, bulk, height, siting and proximity, would be detrimental to the amenities of the adjoining occupier at 26 Sweetcroft Land by reason of overdominance, overshadowing, visual intrusion, loss of light and loss of outlook. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies.",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2016). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service."
