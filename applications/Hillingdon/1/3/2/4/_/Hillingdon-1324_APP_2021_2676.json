    "The proposed outbuilding, by reason of its size, scale, internal layout and capacity for independent access, is considered to be capable of independent occupation from the main dwelling and is thus tantamount  to a separate dwelling in a position where such a dwelling would not be acceptable as it could result in an unacceptable impact on adjoining occupiers and additional requirements for parking and amenity space. The proposal is therefore contrary to policies DMHB 11, DMHB 18, DMT 6 and DMHD 2 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and Policies D6 and T6.1 of the London Plan (March 2021)."
