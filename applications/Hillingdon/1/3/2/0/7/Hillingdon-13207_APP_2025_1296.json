    "The proposed outbuilding, by virtue of its scale and siting, would significantly increase the built up character and appearance of the site, to the detriment of the character and appearance of this prominent corner plot and would result in a cramped and incongruous form of development. The proposal would be therefore contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012), Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD2 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policies D1, D3, D4 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2024).",
    "The proposed outbuilding, due to its scale and siting, would result in an unacceptable loss of light and outlook to a habitable bedroom of the host dwelling and would therefore give rise to a substandard form of living accommodation to the detriment of the amenities of the occupiers of the host dwelling, contrary to Policy DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies and Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
