  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed development, by reason of its siting on a prominent corner plot, size, scale, bulk, and design, would result in an unduly intrusive, visually prominent and incongruous form of development. The proposal would therefore be detrimental to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area. The proposal would therefore contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012), Policies DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policies D1, D3, D4 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The proposed development, by virtue of its siting, size, scale and height, would cause harm to the living conditions of neighbouring residential occupiers at number 4 Wyre Grove and their associated private external amenity space, in terms of outlook, sense of enclosure and overbearing impact. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012), Policy DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The proposed development, by virtue of the proximity of the on-site car parking space and proposed boundary treatment in relation to ground floor habitable windows, would result in poor and inadequate outlook for the future occupants of the proposed dwellings. The proposal would therefore result in a substandard form of internal residential accommodation to the detriment of the amenity of the future occupiers of the proposed development, contrary to Policies DMHB 15 and DMHB 16 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The proposed development, by reason of its inadequate size, quality and functionality of external amenity space provision, would result in substandard forms of residential accommodation to the detriment of future occupants. The proposal therefore conflicts with Policy DMHB 18 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The proposed development, by virtue of the introduction of a new vehicular crossover in close proximity to the junction with North Hyde Road and Wyre Road would cause a material highway safety risk. Furthermore, the intensification of the residential use of the site is likely to increase the likely conflict between road users. The proposal therefore conflicts with Policies DMT1, DMT 2 and DMT 6 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2- Development Management Policies (2020), Policies T6 and T6.1 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "a) We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal.",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan - The Spatial Development Strategy for London consolidated with alterations since 2011 (2016) and national guidance."
