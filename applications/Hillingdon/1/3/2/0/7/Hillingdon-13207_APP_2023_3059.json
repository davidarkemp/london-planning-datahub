    "The proposed development, by reason of its siting in this prominent corner plot position, size, scale, bulk, site coverage would result in the loss of an important gap characteristic to the area and would thus result in a cramped, unduly intrusive, visually prominent over-development of the site. The proposal would therefore be detrimental to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012), Policies DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policies D1, D3, D4 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The proposed development does not constitute permitted development by virtue of the provisions of Schedule 2, Part 1, Class AA of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2020 (as amended) as the proposal, by reason of its siting, scale, bulk, height, and design would result in harm to the amenities of numbers 4 Wyre Grove and 137 North Hyde Road by reason of loss of light, overlooking, loss of outlook and a harmful loss of privacy contrary to Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020). Therefore Prior Approval is refused pursuant to Condition AA.2.-(3)(a)(i) of Schedule 2, Part 1, Class AA,  the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2020 (as amended)."
