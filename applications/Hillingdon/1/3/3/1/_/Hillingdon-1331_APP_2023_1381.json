The information submitted fails to demonstrate that surface water run off is controlled to ensure the development does not increase the risk of flooding contrary to Policy EM6 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 (2012), Policy DMEI 10 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 (2020), Policies SI 12 and SI 13 of the London Plan (2021), National Planning Policy Framework, and the Planning Practice Guidance (March 2014). The application is therefore refused.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably. In addition further guidance was offered to the applicant by the case officer during the processing of the application to identify the amendments to address those elements of the scheme considered unacceptable which the applicant did not respond to."
