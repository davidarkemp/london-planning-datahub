  "description": "Demolition of existing buildings and erection of 3 storey plus basement 84-bedroom hotel (Use Class C1), together with soft and hard landscaping, servicing, cycle storage, car parking and refuse and recycling facilities.",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed development, by virtue of the size of the building and basement, its layout, design, materials and lack of soft landscaping features would appear incongruous and result in a cramped form of overdevelopment that fails to respond to its local context and streetscene, would fail to respect the established pattern of development within the streetscene and would not contribute positively to the area's residential character contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHB 14 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policies 7.1 and 7.6 of the London Plan (2016) and Paragraph 127 of the NPPF (2019).",
    "The proposed development, by virtue of the limited separation between adjoining residential properties and proposed hotel and the positioning of the windows across all elevations would give rise to increased overlooking into neighbouring habitable rooms at Nos. 27 and 33 Shepiston Lane and their neighbouring gardens. Furthermore, due to the increased number of bedrooms in the proposed hotel as compared to the existing use and the increased intensity of use, the proposal would be likely to have an adverse impact on the amenity of adjoining neighbours by virtue of noise and general disturbance from traffic movements, emissions, comings and goings and servicing of the hotel contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012) and Policies DMHB 11 and DME 5 of the of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The proposed development, by virtue of its access / egress arrangements does not allow sufficient space for a vehicle leaving the application site to turn and be properly aligned at the Give Way line with Shepiston Lane.  As vehicles would arrive at the Give Way at an awkward angle they would obstruct other vehicles turning into the service road from Shepiston Lane. The proposal would therefore result in obstruction and conflict with the movement of other vehicles, cyclists and pedestrians using this part of Shepiston Lane contrary to Policies DMT 1 and DMT 2 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The proposed development, in the absence of a Section 106 legal agreement fails to provide contributions towards the improvement of services and facilities as a consequence of demands created by the proposed development (in respect of construction training, highways works, Travel Plan, Hospitality Training contributions, air quality contributions and Project Management and Monitoring). The scheme therefore conflicts with Policy DMCI 7 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), the London Borough of Hillingdon Supplementary Planning Document on Planning Obligations, Policy DF1 of the London Plan Intend to Publish Version (2019), Policy 8.2 of the London Plan (2016) and paras 54-57 of the NPPF 2019.",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan - The Spatial Development Strategy for London consolidated with alterations since 2011 (2016) and national guidance.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service. In order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably. In addition further guidance was offered to the applicant by the case officer during the processing of the application to identify the amendments to address those elements of the scheme considered unacceptable which the applicant chose not to implement.",
    "This is a reminder that Under the terms of the Planning Act 2008 (as amended) and Community Infrastructure Levy Regulations 2010 (as amended), should an application for appeal be allowed, the proposed development would be deemed as 'chargeable development' and therefore liable to pay the London Borough of Hillingdon Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and the Mayor of London's Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This would be calculated in accordance with the London Borough of Hillingdon CIL Charging Schedule 2014 and the Mayor of London's CIL Charging Schedule 2012.",
