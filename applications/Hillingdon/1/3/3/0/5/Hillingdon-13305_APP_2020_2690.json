  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed development, by reason of its size, scale, bulk, height and design, would constitute an over development of the site that would result in a poor and incongruous form of development that would be detrimental to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 1 and DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), Policy 7.8 of the London Plan (2016) and the NPPF.",
    "The proposal would by reason of it's excessive height, depth and proximity would result in harm to the residential amenity of occupants at No. 21 The Avenue by reason of loss of light, outlook and overbearing impact. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and Policies 3.5 and 5.3 of the London Plan (2016).",
    "The proposed landscaping scheme to the site frontage including the proposed boundary treatment would be harmful to the open and verdant character of the site, the street scene and the wider area. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy DMHB 14 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan - The Spatial Development Strategy for London consolidated with alterations since 2011 (2016) and national guidance.",
    "The applicant should note that as part of any resubmission they should ensure the submitted plans fully consider accessibility. The submitted scheme requires revisions to meet all the standards for an M4(2) accessible and adaptable dwelling, as required by the 2016 London Plan and its contained policy 3.8 (c). Specifically, the entrance level W/C fails to meet the spatial requirements for a three bed dwelling, a set out in Approved Document M to the building regulations. Particular attention should also be paid to the clear access zones and spatial requirements within entrance lobby, kitchen, bedrooms and bathrooms."
