    "The applicant has failed to provide proof that the application property was not constructed before 1st July 1948 or after 28th October 2018. The application submission therefore fails to accord with Schedule 2, Part 1, Class AA.1. (c) of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2020 (as amended).",
