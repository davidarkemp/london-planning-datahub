    "The proposed development due to the design, siting, scale, materials and provision of a second customer entrance at the rear of the site would appear visually incongruous, out of character with the pattern of development, and visually intrusive within the street scene, to the detriment of the appearance of the subject site, the wider shopping parade, the visual amenities of the street scene and the character of the area, contrary to policy D3 of the London Plan (2021), policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and policies DMTC 4, DMHB 11 and DMHB 13 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two (2020).",
    "The proposed development fails to demonstrate that unacceptable levels of noise, disturbance and odour to surrounding residential occupiers would be appropriately mitigated, that sufficient refuse and recycling arrangements would be implemented to prevent litter. The proposed development would therefore harm the residential amenity of neighbouring occupiers and the general amenities of the area, contrary to Policies DMTC 4 and DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan - Part Two (2020) and Policies D13 and D14 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "No details have been submitted to demonstrate how the seating area satisfies accessibility criteria. In the absence of this information, the development does not meet the requirements of Policy D5 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan - The Spatial Development Strategy for London consolidated with alterations since 2011 (2016) and national guidance.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
