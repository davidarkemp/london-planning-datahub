  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed front/side extension by reason of its size, scale, bulk and design, would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original dwelling and would be detrimental to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the street scene and the wider Gatehill Farm Estate Area of Special Local Character. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policies BE1 and HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 1, DMHB 5, DMHB 6, DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. The Council's supports pre-application discussions in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably. We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
