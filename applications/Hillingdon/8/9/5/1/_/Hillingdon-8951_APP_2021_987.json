    "The proposed front extension by reason of its size, scale, bulk, width and design, would represent an unduly incongruous form of development which would be detrimental to the architectural composition of the existing building and would be detrimental to the visual amenities of the street scene and the wider area. The proposed development is therefore contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the  Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The proposed two storey rear extension, by reason of its excessive size, scale, bulk and design, including the substantial roof form, would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original building and would be detrimental to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the surrounding area. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
