    "The proposed development, by reason of its siting, size, width, scale, massing and overall design would result in an incongruous visually prominent form of development that would fail to harmonise with the character and architectural composition of the surrounding properties, resulting in a visually dominant building which would be detrimental to the character, appearance and visual amenity of the street scene and the setting of Ickenham Village Conservation Area. The limited public benefits would not outweigh the harm to the Ickenham Village Conservation Area. The proposal therefore conflicts with Policies BE1 and HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012), Policies DMHB 1, DMHB 4, DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policies HC1, D1, D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021) and Chapters 12 and 16 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2024).",
    "Due to its depth, scale, bulk, siting and overall design, the proposed development would have an overbearing impact on the adjoining residents leading to a harmful sense of enclosure and loss of outlook to the residents of Nos 88 and 92 Long Lane. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012), Policy DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2024).",
    "The proposal fails to demonstrate through a comprehensive fire statement how the development would achieve the highest standards of fire safety in regard to its design in incorporating appropriate features which reduce the risk to life in the event of a fire, its construction methods,",
    "means of escape, strategy of evacuation and providing suitable access and equipment for firefighting appropriate for the size and residential nature of the development. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policies D5 and D12 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2024).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan (2021) and national guidance.",
    "This is a reminder that Under the terms of the Planning Act 2008 (as amended) and Community Infrastructure Levy Regulations 2010 (as amended), should an application for appeal be allowed, the proposed development would be deemed as 'chargeable development' and therefore liable to pay the London Borough of Hillingdon Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and the Mayor of London's Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This would be calculated in accordance with the London Borough of Hillingdon CIL Charging Schedule 2014 and the Mayor of London's CIL Charging Schedule 2012.",
