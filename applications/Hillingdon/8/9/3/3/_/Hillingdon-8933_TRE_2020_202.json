    "Refused  - To carry out tree surgery including a reduction back to boundary line from One Oak  (T1 on application, situated within the garden of 59), To crown reduce height by 3m and spread by 1-2m Two groups of Hornbeam (G1 and G3 on application), To reduce height by 3m One group of Hornbeam (G2 on application), and To Crown reduce by 2-3m One Oak (T3 on application), all within Area 1 on TPO 398",
    "Two oak trees and three groups of Hornbeams are all situated within the rear garden of 61 Copse Wood Way and One Oak tree situated within 59 Copse wood Way but close to the boundary line. Collectively as a group they have a moderate to high amenity value and they significantly contribute to the arboricultural amenity of the CopseWood Estate Area of Special Local Character (ASLC). They provide a gradual transition of mature tree cover between the dwellings in the copse wood estate and the nearby Ruislip woods National Nature Reserve (NNR). The benefit in amenity and biodiversity afforded by the trees is both present and future because they have the potential for long life expectancies.",
    "With regard to the work to reduce back in line with the boundary to One Oak (T1 on application), no reason has been provided as to why this is required. With regard to the reduction works proposed for the other Oak (T3 on application) and three groups of Hornbeams (G1, G2 and G3 on application) the reaso",
    "Approved - To Crown reduce by 3m One Oak (T2 on application) within Area 1 on TPO 398",
    "The Oak tree (T2 on application) to be pruned shall be crown reduced as per the approved specification. This work shall comprise a reduction in both height and spread over the whole crown by shortening or removing peripheral branches in a uniform and systematic manner.  Where branches are shortened, they should be cut back to a suitably positioned secondary branch.",
    "Crown reduction shall not be construed as 'lopping' or 'topping' and shall result in a tree of typical form for the species and of balanced appearance. The works shall be carried out in accordance with the recommendations contained in BS 3998:2010 'Tree work - Recommendations'. Climbing irons or 'spikes' shall not be used during the execution of the work.",
    "REASON",
    "In order to protect health of the tree and the visual amenity of the area.",
    "The removal of deadwood, dangerous / hanging branches and ivy:  This does not require the formal consent of the Council.",
    "Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981:  Note that it is an offence under this act to disturb roosting bats, nesting birds or any other protected species.  Therefore, if applicable, it is advisable to consult your tree surgeon / consultant to agree an acceptable time for carrying out the approved works.",
    "Expected standard of tree work: The approved works must be carried out in accordance with the conditions laid out above. If they are not, then enforcement action could being taken which could lead to prosecution and heavy fines. Therefore, it is highly recommended that the works are only carried out by a professional and competent arboriculturist who undertakes to comply with the conditions of this consent and in accordance with industry best practice (BS 3998:2010). The Arboricultural Association can provide details of its approved contractors, who have demonstrated such professionalism and competence, on their website (www.trees.org.uk) or by calling 01242 522152. Or on request the Council can provide a list of contractors who are known to carry out tree work to a good standard and to normally maintain an appropriate policy of indemnity insurance."
