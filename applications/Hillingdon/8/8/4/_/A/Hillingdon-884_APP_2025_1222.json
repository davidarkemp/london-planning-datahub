    "REASON",
    "To ensure that the amenity of the occupiers of adjoining residential properties is not adversely affected by noise in accordance with Policies D3 and D13 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "It is considered that a condition based on fixed noise levels is consistent with noise and planning policy by relating external noise levels to the point at which adverse effects on health and quality of life start to be observed. The limit values are intended to be consistent with the evidence base that is reflected in guidance: 'Guidance on Sound Insulation and Noise Reduction for Buildings' BS8233 2014. This is combined with the assessment principles and procedures detailed in guidance: 'Methods for rating and assessing industrial and commercial sound' British Standards Institution BS4142 2014.' This is used to set reference time periods for the assessment and adjust measured or calculated LAeq values for character as detailed in BS4142 to determine the rating level.",
