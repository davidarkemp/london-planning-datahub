    "The proposal, by reason of its location, scale, bulk, form, design and use of materials would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the locally listed host building and would be detrimental to its setting. Furthermore, the development would be detremental to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the street scene and would fail to either preserve or enhance the character or appearance of The Greenway Conservation Area. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies BE1 and HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 1, DMHB 3, DMHB 4 and DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policies D3, D8 and HC1 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The proposal, by reason of the extent of the hardstanding to the frontage to provide on-site car parking and the removal of the front hedgerow, would be detrimental to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the street scene and would fail to either preserve or enhance the character or appearance of The Greenway Conservation Area and setting of the host locally listed building. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies BE1 and HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 1, DMHB 3, DMHB 4, DMHB 11 and DMHB 14 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policies D3, D8 and HC1 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The proposal fails to retain amenity space of sufficient size and quality commensurate to the size and layout of the flats within the host building.  As such the proposal would provide a substandard form of accommodation for future residents contrary to Policy DMHB18 of the Hillingdon Local Plan - Part Two (2020).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan (2021).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal.",
    "This is a reminder that Under the terms of the Planning Act 2008 (as amended) and Community Infrastructure Levy Regulations 2010 (as amended), should an application for appeal be allowed, the proposed development would be deemed as 'chargeable development' and therefore liable to pay the London Borough of Hillingdon Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and the Mayor of London's Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This would be calculated in accordance with the London Borough of Hillingdon CIL Charging Schedule 2014 and the Mayor of London's CIL Charging Schedule 2012.",
