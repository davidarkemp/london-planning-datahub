    "The location and amount of development proposed would result in a harmful loss of garden land which would fail to preserve or enhance the character and appearance of the site, streetscene and wider Greenway Conservation Area. It would also detract from the setting of the locally listed building, harming its significance. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies BE1 and HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMH 6, DMHB 1, DMHB 3, DMHB 4, DMHB 11 and DMHB 14 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policies D3, D8 and HC1 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021) and paragraph 130 of the NPPF (2021).",
    "This is a reminder that Under the terms of the Planning Act 2008 (as amended) and Community Infrastructure Levy Regulations 2010 (as amended), should an application for appeal be allowed, the proposed development would be deemed as 'chargeable development' and therefore liable to pay the London Borough of Hillingdon Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and the Mayor of London's Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This would be calculated in accordance with the London Borough of Hillingdon CIL Charging Schedule 2014 and the Mayor of London's CIL Charging Schedule 2012.",
