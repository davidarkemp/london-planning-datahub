  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed development, by virtue of its layout would facilitate a material change of use of the property to a residential institution (Use Class C2) that could harm the amenity and reasonable enjoyment of the neighbouring property for current and future occupiers contrary to Policy DMHB 11 of the Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2019).",
    "The proposed development, by virtue of its layout, facilitates the care of individuals with complex needs. The applicant has failed to provide detailed information relating to its use or a site management plan to ensure the property incorporates appropriate design and security features to deter crime and anti-social behaviour  contrary to Policies DMHB 11 and DMH 8  of the Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and Policy 7.3 of London Plan (2016) and Paragraph's 91 and 127 of the NPPF (2019).",
    "The proposed development, in the absence of detail relating to inclusive design has failed to demonstrate the proposal would deliver an inclusive design for future occupants of the care home contrary to Policy DMHB 11 of the Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and Polices 3.8 and 7.2 of the London Plan (2016) and Supplementary Planning Document 'Accessible Hillingdon' (2017).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan - The Spatial Development Strategy for London consolidated with alterations since 2011 (2016) and national guidance.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
