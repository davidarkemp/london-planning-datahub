  "description": "Two storey side and rear extension (following demolition of side and rear extension) including first floor rear Juliet Balconies; single storey side/rear extension; removal of chimneys; re-location of first floor side windows and side and rear rooflights.",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed two-storey side and rear extension including single storey side/rear extension, by reason of its combined height, width and in particular cumulative depth, bulk and massing would result in a dominant, visually intrusive, disproportionate, overbearing, incongruous and excessively sized addition that would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original dwelling, would unbalance the relationship with the adjoining uniform properties of no.44 and 46 Greenacres Avenue including those similar along the road and would be detrimental to the character and appearance of the surrounding area and visual amenities of the streetscene. Therefore, the proposal would be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012) and Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The proposed two-storey side and rear extension by reason of the siting, combined height, width, depth, scale and proximity would be detrimental to the amenities of the adjacent occupiers of no.40 Greenacres Avenue, in terms of overdominance, overshadowing, visual intrusion, overbearing impact, loss of daylight/sunlight and loss of outlook. Therefore, the proposal would be contrary to Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2021). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020."
