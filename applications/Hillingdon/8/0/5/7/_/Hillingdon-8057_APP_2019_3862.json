  "description": "Erection of a part 4, part 5 storey building accommodating 14 dwellings (9 x 1 bed, 3 x 2 bed and 2 x 3 bed flats) and commercial space, and the erection of a separate 2 storey building with roof accommodation to provide 2 x 3 bed houses, car and cycle parking and private and communal amenity space.",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed development, by virtue of its height, scale and mass would appear to be an incongruous form of development that fails to respond to its local context and would fail to respect the established pattern and scale of development within the streetscene so that it would not contribute positively to the area's character, contrary to Policy BE1 of the Local Plan: Part One (November 2012), Policies DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy 7.6 of the London Plan (2016) and Paragraph 131 of the NPPF (2019).",
    "The proposed development, in the absence of a Section 106 legal agreement fails to provide contributions towards the improvement of services and facilities as a consequence of demands created by the proposed development (in respect of Affordable housing, construction training, highways works, carbon offset, public open space, air quality contributions and Project Management and Monitoring). The scheme therefore conflicts with Policy DMCI 7 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two Development management Policies (2020), the London Borough of Hillingdon Supplementary Planning Document on Planning Obligations, Policy DF1 of the London Plan Intend to Publish Version (2019), Policy 8.2 of the London Plan (2016) and paras 54-57 of the NPPF 2019.",
    "The decision to GRANT/REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to GRANT/REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan - The Spatial Development Strategy for London consolidated with alterations since 2011 (2016) and national guidance.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service. In order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably. In addition further guidance was offered to the applicant by the case officer during the processing of the application to identify the amendments to address those elements of the scheme considered unacceptable which the applicant chose not to implement.",
    "This is a reminder that Under the terms of the Planning Act 2008 (as amended) and Community Infrastructure Levy Regulations 2010 (as amended), should an application for appeal be allowed, the proposed development would be deemed as 'chargeable development' and therefore liable to pay the London Borough of Hillingdon Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and the Mayor of London's Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This would be calculated in accordance with the London Borough of Hillingdon CIL Charging Schedule 2014 and the Mayor of London's CIL Charging Schedule 2012.",
