    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate that the new use would have an acceptable impact on traffic, access and parking. No highways assessment, existing or predicted trip generation data, vehicular or cycle parking has been provided or evidenced in the submission. As a result the applicant has failed to demonstrate the new use would have no adverse impact on the local highways network or its users. The proposal is therefore considered to be contrary to Policies DMT 2, DMT 4 and DMT 6 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy T4 and T6 of the London Plan (2021) and paragraph 111 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
