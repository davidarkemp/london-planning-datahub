    "The removal of deadwood, dangerous / hanging branches and ivy:  This does not require the formal consent of the Council.",
    "Statutory crown lifting of trees: This does not require formal consent of the Council if the clearance only involves the removal of branches to give a separation between the footway and the tips of the lowest branches by up to 2.3m or the carriageway by up to 5.2m.",
    "Clearance of telephone wires: Work to free telephone wires / cables, by cutting back secondary and tertiary branches to provide up to 500 mm clearance between the wires / cables and tree branches (i.e. forming corridors through the canopy and thereby abating the nuisance) does not require the formal consent of the Council.",
    "The very mature Oak tree is situated in the front garden. It can be seen from all angles by multiple houses, pedestrians and car users. The tree is in a good condition with a high amenity value, due to all these reasons.",
    "The specification is to prune the tree back to previous. This would result in a substantial amount of the crown being removed. The tree would have multiple wounds of excessive size that could result in the tree being open to infection from pest and disease. This would lower the amenity value that it provides for the local area.",
    "This specification is not specific and where there is previous pruning is too excessive. There are no arboricultural reasons given for the work and it will be of detriment to the trees ongoing sustainability."
