    "Due to the cumulative number, size, bulk and massing of the dormer extensions, the proposed development would appear as an incongruous addition failing to respect the original roof form and architectural composition of the dwelling. The positioning of the dividing wall within the loft bedrooms also intersects the dormer windows, which is considered to be poor design. Consequently, the proposal would cause significant harm to the character and appearance of the host property and the surrounding area, contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One- Strategic Policies (2012), Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policies  D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021) and Chapter 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023).",
    "The proposed first floor front and rear bedrooms would have an insufficient level of light, ventilation and outlook due to the shared windows within the front and rear dormer extensions. Consequently, the proposal would impact the living conditions of current and future occupiers of the dwelling adversely, contrary to Policy DMHB 16 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service. We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
