    "The proposed conversion of the two storey dwelling into separate flats would result in the loss of a residential unit that is suitable for a family. The proposal would have a detrimental effect on the supply of family housing within the Borough. The principle of development is considered to be unacceptable. The proposal would be contrary to Policies DMH 1, DMH 2 and DMH 4 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and Paragraph 69 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023).",
    "The proposed development, by virtue of its failure to maintain an adequate internal floor area and provision of private external amenity space, would have a harmful effect on the living conditions of the occupants of the proposed new upper floor flat. The development would therefore be contrary to Policies DMHB 16, DMHB 18 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021) and Paragraph 135f) of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023).",
    "The proposed development, due to the proximity of the private amenity space for the ground floor flat to the habitable windows on the rear elevation serving primary accommodation in the upper floor flat, would harm the residential amenity of the future occupiers by virtue of loss of privacy, visual intrusion and overlooking. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policies DMHD 1 and DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021) and Paragraph 135f) of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023).",
    "The development would fail to provide safe and acceptable vehicle access, car and cycle parking, which would increase parking stress, prejudice highway safety and fail to encourage sustainable modes of transport including cycling and walking. The development is therefore contrary to Policies DMT 1, DMT 2, DMT 5 and DMT 6 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policies T2, T4, T6 and T6.1 of the London Plan (2021) and Paragraphs 115 and 116 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2021). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal.",
    "This is a reminder that Under the terms of the Planning Act 2008 (as amended) and Community Infrastructure Levy Regulations 2010 (as amended), should an application for appeal be allowed, the proposed development would be deemed as 'chargeable development' and therefore liable to pay the London Borough of Hillingdon Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and the Mayor of London's Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This would be calculated in accordance with the London Borough of Hillingdon CIL Charging Schedule 2014 and the Mayor of London's CIL Charging Schedule 2012.
