Paragraph W(3)(d) of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended) states that the local planning authority may refuse an application where, in the opinion of the authority the developer has provided insufficient information to enable the authority to establish whether the proposed development complies with, any conditions, limitations or restrictions specified in this Part of being applicable to the development in question. As such, the prior approval application is refused."
