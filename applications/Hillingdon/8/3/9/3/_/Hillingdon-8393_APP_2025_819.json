    "To comply with Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990.",
    "The development hereby permitted shall not be carried out except in complete accordance with the details shown on the submitted plans and documents:",
    "01 PL",
    "06 PL",
    "07 PL",
    "and shall thereafter be retained/maintained for as long as the development remains in existence.",
    "REASON",
    "To ensure the development complies with the provisions of the Hillingdon Local Plan Parts 1 (2012) and 2 (2020) and the London Plan (2021).",

    "The materials to be used in the construction of the rooftop plant screening hereby permitted shall match the timber red western dear cladding used on the existing building, as illustrated on the approved drawings, and shall thereafter be retained as such.",
    "REASON",
    "To safeguard the visual amenities of the area and to ensure that the proposed development does not have an adverse effect upon the appearance of the existing building in accordance with Policy DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 (2020).",
    "For the lifetime of the development hereby permitted the rating level (LAr) of noise caused by its operation shall not exceed: 40 dB LAr 15 min for any fifteen-minute period between 2300 and 0700, and 50 dB LAr 1 hour for any one-hour period between 0700 and 2300, determined one metre free field external to any window or door of any permanent residential, or equivalently noise sensitive premises, in accordance with 'Methods for rating and assessing industrial and commercial sound' British Standards Institution BS4142 2014.'",
    "REASON:",
    "To protect residential amenity and ensure that users of commercial premises are not unduly affected by air extraction system noise in accordance with Policies D13 and D14 of The London Plan (2021) and Policy DMHB 11 of the Local Plan Part 2 (2020).",
    "The decision to GRANT planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",

    "It is considered that a condition based on fixed noise levels is consistent with noise and planning policy by relating external noise levels to the point at which adverse effects on health and quality of life start to be observed. The limit values are intended to be consistent with the evidence base that is reflected in guidance: 'Guidance on Sound Insulation and Noise Reduction for Buildings' BS8233 2014. This is combined with the assessment principles and procedures detailed in guidance: 'Methods for rating and assessing industrial and commercial sound' British Standards Institution BS4142 2014.' This is used to set reference time periods for the assessment and adjust measured or calculated LAeq values for character as detailed in BS4142 to determine the rating level.",
    "The Applicant is advised that change of use of the building to a primary use as a 'dark kitchen' (Sui Generis use) would require planning permission.",
