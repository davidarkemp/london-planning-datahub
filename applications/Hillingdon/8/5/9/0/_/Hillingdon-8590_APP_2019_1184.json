    "The detached building, by reason of its size, scale, bulk, height and excessive footprint, results in an over dominant and visually obtrusive form of development, to the detriment of the visual amenity of the surrounding residential properties and the character and appearance of the wider area including the adjoining Harlington Village Conservation Area. Therefore the proposal is contrary to policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), policies  BE4, BE13, BE15 and BE19 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Saved UDP Policies (November 2012), the Council's adopted Supplementary Planning Document HDAS: Residential Extensions and Policy DMHD 2 of the Alterations and Extensions to Residential Dwellings of the London Borough Of Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 Development Management Policies with Modifications (March 2019) .",
    "The proposed outbuilding by virtue of its size, scale, layout and the existence of an independent access, would be tantamount to the creation of a self contained separate dwelling, where such a dwelling would not be acceptable due to its impact on the character and appearance of the host dwelling and the wider locality, the need for additional parking and amenity space and issues relating to impact on the existing and adjoining dwellings. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policies AM14, BE13, BE15, BE19, BE20, BE21, BE23 and BE24 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Saved UDP Policies (November 2012), the Council's adopted Supplementary Planning Document HDAS: Residential Extensions and Policy DMHD 2 of the Alterations and Extensions to Residential Dwellings of the London Borough Of Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 Development Management Policies with Modifications (March 2019) .",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant saved policies (referred to as policies from the Hillingdon Unitary Development Plan - Saved Policies September 2007), then London Plan Policies (2016).  On the 8th November 2012 Hillingdon's Full Council agreed the adoption of the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies. Appendix 5 of this explains which saved policies from the old Unitary Development (which was subject to a direction from Secretary of State in September 2007 agreeing that the policies were 'saved') still apply for development control decisions.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. The Council's supports pre-application discussions.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
