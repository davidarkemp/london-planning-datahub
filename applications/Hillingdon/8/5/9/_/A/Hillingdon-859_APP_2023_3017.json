    "The proposed development, by virtue of its increased scale, bulk, massing, depth and siting, would result in an overly dominant development that would adversely affect the outlook from and light to the adjacent property at No.43 Pield Heath Avenue, resulting in harm to neighbouring residential amenity. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) .",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
