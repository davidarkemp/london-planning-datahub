Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policies BE1 and HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies BE5, BE13, BE15 and BE19 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Unitary Development Plan Saved Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 1, DMHB 5 and DMHD 1 of the emerging Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies with Modifications (March 2019) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document HDAS: Residential Extensions.",

The Council's supports pre-application discussions. In this instance, the Council has been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
