    "Due to its excessive height, depth, width, bulk, materials and incorporation of uncharacteristic features, the proposed extension would form an oversized addition that would not be subordinate to the existing dwelling and fail to respect its original design and appearance. Due to its location, size and design, the resulting building would also form an unduly prominent, incongruous, and visually harmful addition to riverbank, Area of Special Local Character and Frays Avenue. The proposed development is therefore contrary to Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 5 and DMHD 1 of the Local Plan, Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020), as well as Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021) and paragraph 130 of the NPPF (2021).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan - The Spatial Development Strategy for London consolidated with alterations since 2011 (2016) and national guidance."
