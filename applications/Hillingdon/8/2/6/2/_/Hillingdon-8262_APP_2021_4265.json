    "The proposed rear dormer and balcony, by reason of it's siting and close proximity to neighbouring properties would result in an unacceptable loss of privacy and overlooking of neighbouring occupiers contrary to Policy DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework.",
    "The proposed rear dormer and balcony, by reason of it's excessive width, siting, size, bulk and massing, would fail to respect the original roof form and architectural composition of the host dwelling, and would be harmful to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the local area. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policies BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHD 1 and DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework.",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2021). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020."
