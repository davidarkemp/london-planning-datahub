    "The proposed development, by reason of the scale, width, height, design and size of the rear extension would fail to preserve the significance of the Grade II Listed Building by posing less than substantial to moderate harm to the significance and historic fabric of the designated heritage asset. Further, the proposed harm is not considered to be outweighed by the limited public benefits. The development would also cause less than substantial harm to the Old Uxbridge/Windsor Street Conservation Area. As such, the proposal is contrary to Policy HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 (2012), Policies DMHB 1, DMHB 2, DMHB 4 and DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 (2020), Policy HC1 of the London Plan (2021) and Paragraphs 208 and 212 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2024).",
    "The proposal by virtue of its depth, scale, height and proximity is considered to have an unacceptable impact on the amenities of the neighbouring property number 24 High Street. In the absence of sufficient information and a BRE daylight and sunlight assessment, the application has failed to demonstrate that the proposed development would not lead to a loss of light, significant overshadowing or overbearing impact to the adjoining neighbouring property number 24 High Street. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012), Policy DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2024).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan (2021) and national guidance."
