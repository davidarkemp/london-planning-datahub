    "The proposed side extension, by virtue of its siting and scale would give rise to unacceptable loss of outlook, overbearing impact and sense of enclosure to the occupiers at 25 Daymer Gardens, resulting in harm to residential amenity. Therefore, the proposal would be contrary to Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
