    "The proposed amendment, comprising the addition of rooflights, is considered to represent a material change to the approved development (planning permission ref. 45997/APP/2025/335), as it introduces new elements not previously included in the approved plans and conflicts with Condition 6, which restricts the insertion of additional windows. As such, the proposed changes are not non-material within the meaning of Section 96A of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990, and the application is therefore refused."
