    "The proposed boundary wall by reason of its siting in a visually prominent location and the height and design would result in an overbearing and visually intrusive form of development to the detriment of the character and appearance and visual amenity of the street scene and the wider area, contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan (November 2012), Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and policies D4 and D8 of the London Plan (2021).",

We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
