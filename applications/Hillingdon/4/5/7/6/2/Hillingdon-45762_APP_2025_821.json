  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed front porch by reason of its design and siting would disrupt the established uniformity of of the angled entrances that characterise the street scene of Cheviot Close. The proposed single storey rear extension by reason of its design, height and prominent position would fail to integrate with the existing property and would appear visually incongruous when viewed from the street scene. The cumulative impact of the development would therefore be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "The proposed development, by reason of the reduced rear garden size and additional bedroom, would be detrimental to the amenity of the current and future occupiers of 13 Cheviot Close, and would give rise to a substandard form of accommodation, by reason of loss of significant private amenity space.  As such, the proposal would be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One Strategic Policies (2012) and Policies DMHD 1 and DMHB 18 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020)."
