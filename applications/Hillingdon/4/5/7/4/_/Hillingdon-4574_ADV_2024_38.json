    "The proposed advertisement by reason of its size, siting, design, prominent position, height above ground and illumination, would have a very significant harmful impact on the visual amenities of the surrounding area in general and the host building in particular, creating advertising clutter where none exists at present and degrading the visual quality of the urban environment whilst failing to enhance or preserve the Ruislip Village Conservation Area. The proposal is therefore contrary to the Council's adopted policies, in particular Policies HE1 and BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (November 2012) and Policies DMHB1, DMHB4,  DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHB 13A  of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), Policy HC1 of the London Plan (March 2021) and Chapter 16 of the National Planning Policy Framework (December 2024)."
