  "site_name": "70 KINGSWAY",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed development, given the number of potential occupants (9) would give rise to undue noise and general disturbance to neighbouring residents, particularly as a result of a marked increase in comings and goings, insufficient parking facilities leading to a more hazardous highways network for neighbours and over occupation of the undersized rear garden. The proposal would therefore be contrary to the requirements of Policies DMH 5 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and paragraph 135 (f) of the National Planning Policy Framework (2024).",
    "Insufficient evidence has been submitted to demonstrate that the development would provide sufficient parking for its residents or that shortfalls in on-site parking provision would have no adverse impact on the local highways network. The development is therefore considered to lead to a harmful increase in roadside parking which would hinder vehicle movements in the area leading to traffic build up to the detriment of the highways network, whilst simultaneously creating a more hazardous environment for pedestrians and vehicle users. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policies DMT 1, DMT 2 and DMT 6 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), as well as policy T4 of the London Plan and paragraph 116 of the NPPF (2024).",
    "Due to its cramped and substandard internal floor layout and the lack of alternate internal living space, Bedroom 5 would provide future residents with poor and unacceptable living accommodation to the detriment of their amenities. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policy DMHB 16 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021) and paragraph 135 (f) of the National Planning Policy Framework (2024).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan (2021) and national guidance."
