    "The proposed change of use fails to demonstrate an identified need and/or exceptional circumstance for the loss of the existing residential unit to justify the \"out of centre\" medical and health services proposed. The proposal would therefore result in the unacceptable loss of an existing self-contained housing which is not to be replaced with at least equivalent residential floorspace. As such the proposal is contrary to Policy DMH 1 and DMCI 2 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The proposed change of use fails to provide sufficient off street parking provision to meet the councils approved parking standards to service the proposed \"out of centre\" medical and health service.  The development would therefore lead to additional on street parking to the detriment of public and highway safety, contrary to Policies DMCI 2, DMT2 and DMT6 of the Hillingdon Local Plan - Part Two (2020) and Policy T6 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "The proposal fails to demonstrate inclusive design in conflict with Policy D5 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
