    "The proposed side extension by reason of its design in terms of width size would appear less subservient and would unbalance the symmetry of the terrace of which it forms part such that it will significantly harm the visual amenity and architectural composition of the original terraced dwellings and the visual amenity of the local area. The proposal, therefore, would be contrary to Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020)",
    "In the absence of a Tree Survey and Arboricultural Impact Assessment to BS5837: 2005 standards, the application has failed to demonstrate that the development will safeguard existing trees on the site and further fails to demonstrate protection for the long-term retention of the trees. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies DMHB11 and DMHB14 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies  (2020).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service."
