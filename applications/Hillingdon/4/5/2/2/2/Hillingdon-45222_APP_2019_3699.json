    "The proposed application fails to demonstrate that the scheme will not cause harm in relation to Air Quality given its location within an Air Quality Focus Area.  Furthermore the proposal fails to demonstrate appropriate reductions in emissions to sustain compliance with and contribute towards meeting EU limit values and national air quality objectives for pollutants and therefore cannot be considered Air Quality Neutral.",
    "As such the proposal fails to accord with Policy DMEI 14 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2: Development Management Policies (January 2020)",
    "The proposed location of the car park and its access provision would give rise to potential risks to road safety, given the amount of background vehicular, pedestrian and general town centre activity taking place that may distract the driver.  The car park access in this location will also hinder the free flow of traffic especially when the zone U1 resident parking scheme space is occupied.  It is therefore considered the the proposed development fails to accord with Policy DMT 6 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (January 2020)"
