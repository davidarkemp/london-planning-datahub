    "The Limes and Oak in question are situated on the edge of a large woodland alongside a public right of way. As part of this wood, they have a high amenity value and significantly contribute to the arboricultural character of the area.",
    "No reasons have been provided as to why the work is required other than that they are \"spindly woodland species\". Pollarding and crown reducing within a woodland setting without a solid arboricultural reason is seen as unnecessary and will detract from the natural appearance of the woodland.",
    "Having regard to the reasons given for the proposed work, the work is unjustified and will have a detrimental impact on the visual amenity and arboreal character of the area.",
    "The removal of deadwood, dangerous / hanging branches and ivy:  This does not require the formal consent of the Council."
