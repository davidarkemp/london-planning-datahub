  "description": "Part two storey, part single storey rear and first floor side extension",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed first floor side and part two storey/part single storey rear extension, by reason of its siting, size, scale, bulk, and proximity to the side boundary, would result in a closing of the visually open gap between it and the neighbouring property at number 18 Myrtle Close, giving rise to a cramped form of development and possible terracing effect, which would be detrimental to the visual amenities of the host dwelling and the adjoining semi-detached property it forms part of, the street scene and the surrounding area generally. The proposal is therefore contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The proposed part two storey/part single storey rear extension, by virtue of its size, scale, mass and bulk, including the introduction of a double hipped roof profile, would appear as a a disproportionate and incongruous addition and would thus be detrimental to the appearance of the original house, to the character and to the visual amenities of the surrounding area. The proposal would therefore be contrary to  to the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2016). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020."
