    "The proposed extensions, in particular the two storey side extension element, by reason of its size, scale, bulk, width and proximity to the side boundary, would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original dwelling and would result in a closing of the visually open gap between it and the neighbouring property, 32 Filey Waye, giving rise to a cramped form of development. The proposal would, thus, be detrimental to the visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area generally, contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies.",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2016). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020."
