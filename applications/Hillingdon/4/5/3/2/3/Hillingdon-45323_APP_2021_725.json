  "description": "Proposed single storey front extension part two storey, part single storey side/rear extension including demolition of existing conservatory",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed two storey side/rear extension, by virtue of its siting, size, depth, scale and design, including the large crown roof detail, would fail to appear as a subordinate addition, would thus fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original dwelling and would be detrimental to the character and appearance of the existing dwelling and the character and appearance and visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service."
