This increased provision of information by the applicant reflects the potentially greater risk to the water environment. The DQRA report should be prepared by a \"Competent Person\" e.g. a suitably qualified hydrogeologist. More guidance on this can be found at: https://sobra.org.uk/accreditation/register-of-sobra-risk-assesors/. In the absence of any applicable on-site data, a range of values should be used to calculate the sensitivity of the input parameter on the outcome of the risk assessment.",
