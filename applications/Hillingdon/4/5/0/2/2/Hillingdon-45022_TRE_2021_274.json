    "To remove One Ash (T6 on application) T18 and One False Acacia (T1 on application) T9, to crown reduce by 3m One Horse Chestnut (T10 on application) T16, all on TPO 307",
    "The Horse Chestnut to be pruned shall be crown reduced by a maximum of 3m. This work shall comprise a reduction in both height and spread over the whole crown by shortening or removing peripheral branches in a uniform and systematic manner.  Where branches are shortened, they should be cut back to a suitably positioned secondary branch.",
    "Crown reduction shall not be construed as 'lopping' or 'topping' and shall result in a tree of typical form for the species and of balanced appearance. The works shall be carried out in accordance with the recommendations contained in BS 3998:2010 'Tree work - Recommendations'. Climbing irons or 'spikes' shall not be used during the execution of the work.",
    "REASON",
    "In order to protect health of the tree and the visual amenity of the area.",
    "The removal of deadwood, dangerous / hanging branches and ivy:  This does not require the formal consent of the Council.",
    "Crown reduction and/or crown reshaping:  Involves the overall reduction of the height and spread of a tree's crown, whilst, as far as possible, retaining its natural shape. It is advisable to retain smaller branches close to the pruning wounds to aid in the drawing up of water to the wounded tissue.",
    "Pruning:  Branches should be cut back to suitable growth points such as a side branch or outward facing bud.  The retained bud or branch ought to be at least one third of the diameter of the removed limb, to reduce the likelihood of dieback occuring and to maintain a flowing branch line.",
    "Timing of works:  Pruning works should not be carried out during the period of bud burst and care should be taken to ensure that branches are cut back to healthy outward facing buds to avoid die-back to which some species are prone. For major works, such as pollarding or copping, work should only be carried out after the autumn leaf fall when the sap has gone down, and certainly well before the sap rises in the spring before bud burst has taken place.",
    "Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981:  Note that it is an offence under this act to disturb roosting bats, nesting birds or any other protected species.  Therefore, if applicable, it is advisable to consult your tree surgeon / consultant to agree an acceptable time for carrying out the approved works.",
    "It has been noted that T18 Ash (T6 in application) may be hosting a variety of animal species, specifically owls, woodpeckers and other nesting birds. It is compulsory that an ecological survey is carried out before undertaking the works, so to avoid prosecution due to contravention to Wildlife and Countryside Act 1982.",
    "Replacement trees: The replacement trees will require basic maintenance (watering and weeding during spring and summer) for approximately 2-3 years to encourage successful establishment.",
    "Expected standard of tree work: The approved works must be carried out in accordance with the conditions laid out above. If they are not, then enforcement action could being taken which could lead to prosecution and heavy fines. Therefore, it is highly recommended that the works are only carried out by a professional and competent arboriculturist who undertakes to comply with the conditions of this consent and in accordance with industry best practice (BS 3998:2010). The Arboricultural Association can provide details of its approved contractors, who have demonstrated such professionalism and competence, on their website (www.trees.org.uk) or by calling 01242 522152. Or on request the Council can provide a list of contractors who are known to carry out tree work to a good standard and to normally maintain an appropriate policy of indemnity insurance.",
    "The works hereby permitted shall be carried out within 2 years of the date of this consent.",
    "REASON",
    "To enable the Local Planning Authority to reconsider the appropriateness of the works in the light of any change in circumstances.",
    "No felling shall take place until such time as a scheme has been submitted to, and approved in writing by, the Local Planning Authority for two replacement trees, which shall be of 'Standard' size (about 2-3m high) and short-staked for support. The replacement trees shall be planted during the first planting season following the felling works hereby permitted. Thereafter, the replacement trees shall be retained indefinitely and maintained (watered and weeded during the spring and summer) for 2-3 years, or until established.",
    "REASON",
    "In order to comply with the requirements of Section 206 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990.",
    "To crown reduce by 4m to One Lime (T7 on application) T19 and to crown reduce by 2m One Ash (T11 on application) T15 all on TPO 307",
    "T19 Lime and T15 Ash are situated within the back garden of 8 Deborah Crescent. These trees present mature and attractive crowns which can be viewed from Deborah Close and the adjacent park.",
    "The trees have a moderate-to-high amenity value and make a significant positive contribution to the local landscape. The trees also greatly contribute to the local biodiversity.",
    "With regards to the proposed crown reduction by 4m to T19 Lime and 2m to T15 Ash, these trees appear in good health and there is no evidence in the Arboricultural Report provided that the trees need arboricultural work. These proposed works are therefore unjustified.",
    "Conclusion: Having regard to the reasons given for the proposed crown reduction of these two trees , the works are unnecessary, unjustified and will have a detrimental impact on the visual amenity and arboreal character of the local area."
