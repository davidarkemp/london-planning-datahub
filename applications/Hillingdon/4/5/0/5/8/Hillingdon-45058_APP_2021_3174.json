    "The proposed two storey side extension, by virtue of its size, scale and design including the lack of a set back from the established front building line at ground and first floor level coupled with the proposed roof form and the width of the proposed extension, would result in an excessive, visually intrusive, disproportionate, incongruous and overbearing addition that would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original dwelling and the symmetry of the pair of semi-detached dwellinghouses of which it forms a part to the detriment of the visual amenities of the street scene along this section of Haig Road and the character and appearance of the surrounding area. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012) and Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The proposed single storey rear extension, by virtue of the relationship between the roof form of the extension and the roof form of the proposed ground floor side addition, would result in a visually intrusive and incongruous addition that would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original dwelling to the detriment of the visual amenities of the street scene and the character and appearance of the surrounding area. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012) and Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The proposed extension, by virtue of its failure to maintain an adequate amount of private usable external amenity space for the occupiers of the extended property, would result in an over-development of the site detrimental to the residential amenity of existing and future occupiers.  The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012) and Policy DMHB 18 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2016). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020."
