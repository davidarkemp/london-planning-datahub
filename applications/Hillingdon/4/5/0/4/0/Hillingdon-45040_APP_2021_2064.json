    "The proposed first floor side side extension, by reason of its siting in this visually prominent position, and its size, scale, bulk, excessive width and design, including the insertion of the front facing window in the original dwelling, would represent an incongruous and visually intrusive form of development which would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original dwelling, would be detrimental to the character, appearance and symmetry of the small terrace of houses of which it forms a part and to the visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding Central Avenue, Hayes, Area of Special Local Character. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policies BE1 and HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 1, DMHB 5, DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020),Policies D3 and D6 of the London Plan (2021) and the NPPF.",
