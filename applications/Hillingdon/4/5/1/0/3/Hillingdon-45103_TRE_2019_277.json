    "The Oak tree is situated within a rear garden and can be seen from Burwood Avenue and Nightingale close over the properties. It has an attractive crown and as a result has a high amenity value. This Oak significantly contributes to the arboreal character of the Eastcote Park Estate Conservation area.",
    "The Oak tree is actually situated within 7 Nightingale Close which brings into question the accuracy of the report namely the distance from 26 Burwood Avenue (the site of the alleged damage). The arboricultural report states the tree is 20m tall and 27m away from the property whereas the claim assessment report states 25m tall and 25m away from the property.",
    "We have also received strong opposition from the residents association in relation to the negative impact on the Conservation area if the tree were to be removed.",
    "Having regard to the reasons given for the proposed work, the work is unjustified and will have a detrimental impact on the visual amenity and arboreal character of the area",
    "The removal of deadwood, dangerous / hanging branches and ivy:  This does not require the formal consent of the Council."
