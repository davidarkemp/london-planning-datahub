  "description": "To carry out tree Surgery including a reduction of branches overhanging 2B Rofant Road back to boundary, one Oak (T1 on application) and to fell and grind twin stemmed plan (T2 on application) both within A1 on TPO 130",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "Refused  - To carry out tree Surgery including a reduction of branches overhanging 2B Rofant Road back to boundary, one Oak (T1 on application within A1 on TPO 130",
    "Approved - To fell and grind twin stemmed plan (T2 on application) both within A1 on TPO 130",
    "The Twin stemmed plum is situated within the front garden, it is relatively small and has been heavily reduced in the past with a number of wound up it's trunks. As a result it has a low amenity value. The Oak is situated to the rear of 2B Rofant Road and can be seen from then entrance to Ashbourne Square It has a moderate amenity value and significant contributes to the arboricultural character of the local area.",
    "With regards to the proposed reduction of the Oak branches overhanging 2b Rofant Road. This has been completed in the past and as a result has left the Oak with a lopsided appearance. Further reduction to one side will excesserbate this. The reasons given for this work are to reduce encroachment, although it is agreed that there are branches growing over the boundary line these are relatively high up and not close to any structures. As a result, they should not be causing any issues.",
    "Conclusion: Having regard to the reasons given for the proposed reduction of the Oak, the wo",
    "No felling shall take place until such time as a scheme has been submitted to, and approved in writing by, the Local Planning Authority for a replacement tree(s), which shall be of 'Standard' size (about 2-3m high) and short-staked for support. The replacement tree shall be planted during the first planting season following the felling works hereby permitted. Thereafter, the replacement tree(s) shall be retained indefinitely and maintained (watered and weeded during the spring and summer) for 2-3 years, or until established.",
    "REASON",
    "In order to comply with the requirements of Section 206 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990.",
    "The removal of deadwood, dangerous / hanging branches and ivy:  This does not require the formal consent of the Council.",
    "Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981:  Note that it is an offence under this act to disturb roosting bats, nesting birds or any other protected species.  Therefore, if applicable, it is advisable to consult your tree surgeon / consultant to agree an acceptable time for carrying out the approved works.",
    "Stump removal: After felling, tree stumps are frequently colonised by honey fungus (Armillaria sp.) which is known to spread and colonise nearby trees. Some trees and woody plants can often be killed by honey fungus and, therefore, it is advisable to remove the tree stump and roots as soon as possible after felling."
