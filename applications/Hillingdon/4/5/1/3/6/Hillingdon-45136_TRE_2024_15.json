    "The Oak is situated to the rear of 2B Rofant Road, and can also be seen from the rear of 2 and 2a. The tree is also visible from properties on (no. 1- 4), and from the entrance to, Ashbourne Square. It has a moderate amenity value and significantly contributes to the arboricultural character of the local area.",
    "With regards to the proposed reduction of the Oak branches overhanging 2b Rofant Road - this has been completed in the past and as a result has left the Oak with a unbalanced appearance. Further reduction to one side will exacerbate this. The reasons given for this work are to reduce encroachment - although branches are growing over the boundary line, these are relatively high up and not close to any structures.",
    "The dead wood may be removed and is exempt from application.",
    "With regard to the reasons given for the proposed reduction of the Oak, the works are unnecessary, unjustified and will have a detrimental impact on the visual amenity and arboreal character of the local ar",
    "The removal of deadwood, dangerous / hanging branches and ivy:  This does not require the formal consent of the Council.",
    "Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981:  Note that it is an offence under this act to disturb roosting bats, nesting birds or any other protected species.  Therefore, if applicable, it is advisable to consult your tree surgeon / consultant to agree an acceptable time for carrying out the approved works.",
    "Owner(s)'s permission:  Permission should be sought from the owner(s) of the tree(s) and / or the owner(s) of the land that the tree(s) overhang prior to any approved work being carried out.",
    "Expected standard of tree work: The approved works must be carried out in accordance with the conditions laid out above. If they are not, then enforcement action could being taken which could lead to prosecution and heavy fines. Therefore, it is highly recommended that the works are only carried out by a professional and competent arboriculturist who undertakes to comply with the conditions of this consent and in accordance with industry best practice (BS 3998:2010). The Arboricultural Association can provide details of its approved contractors, who have demonstrated such professionalism and competence, on their website (www.trees.org.uk) or by calling 01242 522152. Or on request the Council can provide a list of contractors who are known to carry out tree work to a good standard and to normally maintain an appropriate policy of indemnity insurance."
