  "description": "Construction of two additional storeys measuring 6.6m maximum height (18.7m above ground level) to provide 31 residential units (Application for Prior Approval under Schedule 2, Part 20, Class AA of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended))",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed works are not 'immediately above the topmost storey' as they involve the removal of the whole roof and propose external alterations and works to the facades of the existing building at all levels, which involve much more than engineering operations. The application submission therefore fails to accord with Schedule 2, Part 20, Class AA.-(1) of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "The applicant has failed to secure parking permit restrictions for future occupiers and financial contributions required to mitigate the highways impacts created by the proposed development. The scheme therefore conflicts with Policies DMCI 7, DMT 1 and DMT 2 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (January 2020), the adopted Planning Obligations Supplementary Planning Document (July 2014), Policy DF1 of the London Plan (2021) and paragraphs 54-57 of the National Planning Policy Framework (February 2019). Prior approval is refused under Condition AA.2.-(1)(a).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service. We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
