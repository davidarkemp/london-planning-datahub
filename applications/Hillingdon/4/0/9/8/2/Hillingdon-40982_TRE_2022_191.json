    "The Oak is situated to the front of 25 Woodridge Way (a dead end road), it is highly visible to other residents in the street as well as those nearby on Sandy Lodge Way. As a result is has a moderate to high amenity value and significantly contributes to the arboreal character of the local area.",
    "The Oak tree appears to be in good health, it has had some minor work approved in the past to ensure the branches are not close to the property. No arboricultural reasons have been provided as to why the work is required instead the applicant has stated \"Routine Maintenance\" although as no full reduction has been approved in the past this application cannot be classed as routine. A crown reduction by as much as 30% will likely introduce multiple large wounds throughout the trees canopy.",
    "It is noted that some of the branches are low over the property access, the lifting of these would fall under the statutory crown lifting exemption.",
    "Having regard to the reasons given for the proposed w",
    "The removal of deadwood, dangerous / hanging branches and ivy:  This does not require the formal consent of the Council.",
    "Statutory crown lifting of trees: This does not require formal consent of the Council if the clearance only involves the removal of branches to give a separation between the footway and the tips of the lowest branches by up to 2.3m or the carriageway by up to 5.2m."
