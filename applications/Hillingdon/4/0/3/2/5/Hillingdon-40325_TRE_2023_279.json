    "The Cypress trees are situated in the rear garden of 5 Nightingale Close, Pinner. They can partly be viewed from the public highway",
    "between properties from within both Nightingale Close and Stevens Close, as a result they have a collective moderate amenity value.",
    "The proposed work to reduce the trees by 1m is refused on the grounds that, to do so, will remove the natural, attractive crown shapes of the trees, and leave them with the appearance of being topped. It is in our opinion that this will reduce the amenity value of the trees.",
    "The proposal to remove the overhanging lateral growth is accepted, and will not have a detrimental impact on the visual amenity and arboreal character of the area.",
    "In regard to the reasons given for the refused proposed work to reduce the height of the trees, the work is unjustified and will have a detrimental impact on the visual amenity and arboreal character of the area.",
    "In regard to the reasons given for the accepted proposed work to prune overha",
    "The removal of deadwood, dangerous / hanging branches and ivy:  This does not require the formal consent of the Council.",
    "Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981:  Note that it is an offence under this act to disturb roosting bats, nesting birds or any other protected species.  Therefore, if applicable, it is advisable to consult your tree surgeon / consultant to agree an acceptable time for carrying out the approved works.",
    "Owner(s)'s permission:  Permission should be sought from the owner(s) of the tree(s) and / or the owner(s) of the land that the tree(s) overhang prior to any approved work being carried out.",
    "Expected standard of tree work: The approved works must be carried out in accordance with the conditions laid out above. If they are not, then enforcement action could being taken which could lead to prosecution and heavy fines. Therefore, it is highly recommended that the works are only carried out by a professional and competent arboriculturist who undertakes to comply with the conditions of this consent and in accordance with industry best practice (BS 3998:2010). The Arboricultural Association can provide details of its approved contractors, who have demonstrated such professionalism and competence, on their website (www.trees.org.uk) or by calling 01242 522152. Or on request the Council can provide a list of contractors who are known to carry out tree work to a good standard and to normally maintain an appropriate policy of indemnity insurance.",
    "The length of the lateral limbs of the trees to be pruned shall be tip-reduced as per the approved specification. This work shall comprise a reduction in the length of the limb(s) in a uniform and systematic manner and the limb(s) should be cut back to suitably positioned secondary branches.",
    "The work shall result in a tree of typical form for the species and of balanced appearance. The level of limb reduction shall be expressed either as a percentage / length of the overall limb length to be removed, or as a level of clearance to be provided.",
    "The works shall be carried out in accordance with the recommendations contained in BS3998: 2010 - \"British Standard Recommendations for Tree Work\".  Climbing irons or 'spikes' shall not be used during the execution of the work.",
    "Reason",
    "In order to protect health of the tree and the visual amenity of the area.",
    "Cut back branches going in to neighbours garden and trim branches facing house to One Cypress T18 on TPO 381.",
    "To carry out tree surgery including a height reduction by 1m  to One Cypress T18 on TPO 381, and to height reduce by 1m Two Cypress within Group 2 on TPO 381."
