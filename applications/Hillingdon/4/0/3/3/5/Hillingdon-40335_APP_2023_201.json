    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate a functioning parking arrangement (whereby the resident of each proposed flat has safe, accessible and usable parking space). The lack of a functioning parking arrangement at the development site would lead to roadside parking which would create a hazardous environment for vehicle users in the area and pedestrians crossing the site, whilst also causing congestion and traffic build up on Albert Road. The proposed development is therefore contrary to Policies DMT 2 and DMT 6 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), as well as policies T4 and T6 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "No Basement Impact Assessment has been submitted in support of the application. In the absence of such an assessment, the applicant has failed to demonstrate that the proposal would not cause unacceptable harm to the built and natural environment and local amenity and that it would not result in flooding or ground instability. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy DMHD 3 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The internal arrangement of Unit 1 and Unit 2 would fail to meet the requirements for a M4(2) accessible and adaptable dwelling as set out in Approved Document M to the Building Regulations (2015 edition). Furthermore the applicant has failed to demonstrate step free accesses for the proposed ground floor units which meet the requirements for a M4(2) accessible and adaptable dwellings as set out in Approved Document M to the Building Regulations (2015 edition).The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy D7 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan (2021).",
    "This is a reminder that Under the terms of the Planning Act 2008 (as amended) and Community Infrastructure Levy Regulations 2010 (as amended), should an application for appeal be allowed, the proposed development would be deemed as 'chargeable development' and therefore liable to pay the London Borough of Hillingdon Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and the Mayor of London's Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This would be calculated in accordance with the London Borough of Hillingdon CIL Charging Schedule 2014 and the Mayor of London's CIL Charging Schedule 2012.",
