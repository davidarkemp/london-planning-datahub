    "Due to its location, size, scale, bulk and uncharacteristic design, including undercroft, the proposal would result in a oversized, incongruous and unduly prominent form of development. Consequently, the proposed development would be detrimental to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area. The undersized rear garden and extensive hard landscaping proposed to the rear of the site would also be out of keeping with surrounding plots, harming the areas character. The proposal would therefore be contrary Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012), Policies DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two- Development Management Policies (2020), Policies D1 and D3 of the London Plan (2021) and Chapter 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The proposal fails to provide an adequate amount and standard of amenity space for future occupiers of the building to the detriment of their amenities. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy DMHB 18 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and paragraph 130 (f) of the NPPF (2021) which seeks to ensure that development provides a high standard of amenity for its existing and future users.",
    "The proposal includes no provision of family sized residential units (3 bedrooms or more) and would result in the loss of a family sized residential unit. The proposal therefore consists of a unsuitable housing mix which would also unacceptably undermine the supply of family housing within the Borough, contrary to Policies DMH 1, DMH 2 and DMH 4 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy H10 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "Unit 1 (basement flat) would provide a poor quality and substandard form of accommodation for future occupiers. The dwelling would have a single aspect, facing onto a retaining wall, and would be overlooked by the shared amenity space to the rear. The proposal would therefore suffer a loss of a privacy and an unacceptable outlook, contrary to paragraph 130 (f) of the NPPF (2021) which seeks to ensure that development provides a high standard of amenity for its existing and future users as well as contrary to Policies DMHB 16 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "Due to the siting of the proposed access road and car parking facilities, marked increase in the number of occupants using the site,  associated comings and goings of people and vehicles and use of the rear garden. The development is considered to give rise to undue noise and disturbance to the occupiers of No.46 Albert Road. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policy DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020) and paragraph 130 (f) of the NPPF (2021).",
    "No Basement Impact Assessment has been submitted in support of the application. In the absence of such an assessment, the applicant has failed to demonstrate that the proposal would not cause unacceptable harm to the built and natural environment and local amenity and that it would not result in flooding or ground instability. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy DMHD 3 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The proposal includes an overprovision of car parking, under provision of cycle parking, no electrical charging points and a narrow access road which would not allow for two way vehicle movements, resulting in cars reversing onto the road , subsequently creating a hazardous environment for vehicle users in the area  and pedestrians crossing the site, whilst also causing congestion and traffic build up on Abert Road. The proposed development is therefore considered to be contrary to Policies DMT 2 and DMT 6 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), as well as policies T4 and T6 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan (2021).",
    "This is a reminder that Under the terms of the Planning Act 2008 (as amended) and Community Infrastructure Levy Regulations 2010 (as amended), should an application for appeal be allowed, the proposed development would be deemed as 'chargeable development' and therefore liable to pay the London Borough of Hillingdon Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and the Mayor of London's Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This would be calculated in accordance with the London Borough of Hillingdon CIL Charging Schedule 2014 and the Mayor of London's CIL Charging Schedule 2012.",
