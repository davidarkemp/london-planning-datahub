    "Due to its design and excessive site coverage, the proposed dwelling would form an uncharacteristic, cramped and visually incongruous form of development which would fail to harmonise with the established character of the area. The proposal would therefore be detrimental to the visual amenities of the streetscene and character of the surrounding area, all contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies, Policies DMH 6, DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policies D1 and D3 of the London Plan (2021), as well as paragraphs 124 and 130 of the NPPF (2021).",
    "Due to its design and close proximity to No.4 Bushey Road, the proposed dwelling would provide direct, unimpeded views into the rear windows of the mentioned property, causing a unacceptable loss of privacy to its occupiers, which would harm their amenities. Additionally the habitable space (bedroom/living room) within the proposed dwelling would be significantly overlooked by No.s 2, 4 and 6 Bushey Road, creating a uncomfortable living environment for its future residents, to the detriment of their amenities (due to a lack of privacy).  The proposal is therefore considered to be contrary to policies DMHB 11 of the Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020) and paragraph 130 (f) of the NPPF (2021).",
    "The existing and proposed dwelling would be provided with 35sqm of shared amenity space, this limited provision is considered to be poor, inadequate and substandard (in terms of size and usability), it would also not be private and therefore it would not be fit for purpose. It is therefore likely to provide its future occupants with poor external living environment to the detriment of their amenities. The proposed development is therefore considered to be contrary to Policy DMHB 18 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan (2021).",
    "This is a reminder that Under the terms of the Planning Act 2008 (as amended) and Community Infrastructure Levy Regulations 2010 (as amended), should an application for appeal be allowed, the proposed development would be deemed as 'chargeable development' and therefore liable to pay the London Borough of Hillingdon Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and the Mayor of London's Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This would be calculated in accordance with the London Borough of Hillingdon CIL Charging Schedule 2014 and the Mayor of London's CIL Charging Schedule 2012.",
