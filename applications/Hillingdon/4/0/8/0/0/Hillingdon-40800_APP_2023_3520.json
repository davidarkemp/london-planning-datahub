    "The proposed development by reason of its siting, size, site coverage, bulk and design would result in a cramped, uncharacteristic and  unduly prominent form of development, which would be detrimental to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area. The proposal would therefore be contrary Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012), Policies DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two- Development Management Policies (2020), Policies D1, D3, D4 and D8 of the London Plan (2021) and paragraphs 128 and 135 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023).",
    "The applicant has failed to enter into a legal agreement to secure highway improve works in to improve walking and cycling routes to and from the site, and to prohibit future residents of the proposed development from applying to join the Councils on street parking management scheme. In the absence of such an agreement the Councils Parking Management Scheme is likely to be overrun, leading to roadside parking, congestion and a reduction in highway safety. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policy DMCI 7, DMT 2 and DMT 5 of the Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020) and T2, T4 and T6 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "Due to its design and close proximity to the street, the proposed development would provide the future residents of its ground floor flats with bedrooms that have no privacy. All of the proposed flats would have inadequate internal floor to ceiling heights, providing their residents with cramped living environments. The future occupiers of Flat 3 would be provided with low quality external amenity space and a living room with poor levels of outlook and access to natural light; to the detriment of their amenities. The proposed development would therefore provide a substandard and unsatisfactory standard of living accommodation for all of its future occupiers, contrary to Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021) and paragraph 135 (f) of the NPPF (2023).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan (2021).",
    "This is a reminder that Under the terms of the Planning Act 2008 (as amended) and Community Infrastructure Levy Regulations 2010 (as amended), should an application for appeal be allowed, the proposed development would be deemed as 'chargeable development' and therefore liable to pay the London Borough of Hillingdon Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and the Mayor of London's Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This would be calculated in accordance with the London Borough of Hillingdon CIL Charging Schedule 2014 and the Mayor of London's CIL Charging Schedule 2012.",
