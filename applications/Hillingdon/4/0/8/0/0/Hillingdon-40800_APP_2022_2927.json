    "The proposed development by reason of its siting, size, scale, bulk, massing and design would result in a oversized, incongruous and unduly prominent form of development. Consequently, the proposed development would be detrimental to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area. The proposal would therefore be contrary Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012), Policies DMH 6, DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two- Development Management Policies (2020), Policies D1, D3, D4 and D8 of the London Plan (2021) and Chapter 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The proposed development, by virtue of its proximity, size, scale, height and design layout would be detrimental to the residential amenities of the neighbouring occupiers at number 3 Warwick Road in terms of loss of outlook, overshadowing, sense of enclosure and overbearing effect. It would also cause a significant loss of privacy to the occupiers of the flats opposite forming part of Broadway Parade, harming their amenities and living standards. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012), Policy DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two- Development Management Policies (2020) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "No legal agreement is in place to prohibit future residents of the proposed development from applying to join the Councils on street parking management scheme. In the absence of such an agreement the Councils Parking Management Scheme is likely to be overrun, leading to roadside parking, congestion and a reduction in highway safety. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policy DMT 2 of the Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020) and T4 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "Due to its contrived design and internal layout, alongside the lack of private amenity space, the proposed development would provide poor a poor standard of amenity and proposed living accommodation for future occupiers, contrary to Policy Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021) and paragraph 130 (f) of the NPPF (2021).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan (2021).",
    "This is a reminder that Under the terms of the Planning Act 2008 (as amended) and Community Infrastructure Levy Regulations 2010 (as amended), should an application for appeal be allowed, the proposed development would be deemed as 'chargeable development' and therefore liable to pay the London Borough of Hillingdon Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and the Mayor of London's Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This would be calculated in accordance with the London Borough of Hillingdon CIL Charging Schedule 2014 and the Mayor of London's CIL Charging Schedule 2012.",
