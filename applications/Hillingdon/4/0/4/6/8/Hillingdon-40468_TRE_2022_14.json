  "decision_conditions": [
    "This Oak tree is a large, mature tree representing a prominent landscape feature which is visible from the dwellings in Deerings Drive and Gerrards Gardens. This tree has a high amenity value and makes a good contribution to the visual amenity and arboreal character of the local area, as well as benefitting local biodiversity and wildlife. A petition with 27 signatures was received in objection to the removal of this Oak.",
    "This Oak shows good canopy cover and a good vitality. No arboricultural assessment has been supplied with the application supporting the need to remove the tree. No documentation from pest companies has been included as evidence that other solutions to the bird fouling issue have been taken into consideration and excluded. No documents have been provided to show that the property is affected by subsidence damage and that this is linked to T14 Oak.",
    "The removal of a large mature tree with a significant vitality and leaf development would be regrettable and would have",
    "The removal of deadwood, dangerous / hanging branches and ivy:  This does not require the formal consent of the Council.",
