    "The proposed development by reason of its combined design, siting, height, width, depth, bulk and massing including lack of set back and set down from the ridge of the roof, would result in a dominant, excessive, bulky and unsympathetic form of development that would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original dwelling, would be detrimental to the character and appearance of the context of which it forms a part and to the visual amenities of the prominent corner siting location, street scene and the surrounding area. Therefore, the proposal would be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012) and Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2016). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020."
