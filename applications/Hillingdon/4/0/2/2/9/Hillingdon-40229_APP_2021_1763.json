    "The proposed development, in particular the first floor rear element, by reason of its combined height, bulk, width and depth, alongside the design of the roof, would result in an excessive, bulky, incongruous, dominant, overbearing and visually intrusive form of development that would substantially harm the form, proportion and appearance of the existing dwelling and its relationship with the terrace row and would be detrimental to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area. As such, the proposal would be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2016). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020."
