  "decision_date": "16/12/2022",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed rear conservatory would result in a secondary extension to an existing extension, thereby extending the property more than 5m beyond the original rear building line and due to its overall depth and significant increase in the footprint of the property, the proposal would not appear as a subordinate addition to the existing dwellinghouse. Furthermore, the proposed pitched roof, located next to the sloped roof of the existing extension, would create an uneven roof form at the rear of the property and would not appear as a sympathetic addition to the property. As such, the proposed development would be adhoc and piecemeal, and would fail to be sympathetic or subordinate to the appearance of the original dwelling. The proposal would therefore have a detrimental impact upon the character and appearance of the application site and the surrounding area, contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD",
    "The proposed extension due to the scale, siting and design, which includes non-obscure glazed side windows facing 62 and 66 Hartland Drive would result in overlooking and the loss of privacy to the occupiers of the neighbouring properties. The proposal would therefore cause harm to the residential amenity of neighbouring properties, contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020)."
