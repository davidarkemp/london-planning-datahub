    "The cumulative impact of the proposed alterations would result in a poorly articulated, dominant and visually intrusive development with poor quality landscaping in this prominent location that is harmful to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the street scene and area. Therefore, the proposal would be contrary to Policies D1, D3, D4 and H2 of the London Plan (2021), Policies BE1 and H1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012) and Policies DMH 6, DMBH 11, DMHB 12, DMHB 14, DMHB 18 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and Section 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021)",
    "The proposed alterations to the site access, parking layout and refuse storage and collection arrangements would create conditions that are detrimental to public/highway safety contrary to Policy DMT 2 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020) and Policies T4 and SI 7 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "The proposed alterations due to the change in proposal description and harm caused by the alterations would not constitute a s73 (Town and Country Planning Act 1990 as amended) minor material amendment and is therefore refused.",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "This is a reminder that Under the terms of the Planning Act 2008 (as amended) and Community Infrastructure Levy Regulations 2010 (as amended), should an application for appeal be allowed, the proposed development would be deemed as 'chargeable development' and therefore liable to pay the London Borough of Hillingdon Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and the Mayor of London's Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This would be calculated in accordance with the London Borough of Hillingdon CIL Charging Schedule 2014 and the Mayor of London's CIL Charging Schedule 2012. For more information on CIL matters please visit the planning portal page at: www.planningportal.gov.uk/planning/applications/howtoapply/whattosubmit/cil",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2021). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020."
