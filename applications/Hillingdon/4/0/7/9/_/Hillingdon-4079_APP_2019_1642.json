    "The proposal, by reason of the loss of a retail unit within the primary shopping area of the Ruislip Town Centre, would erode the retail function of the area, harming the vitality and viability of the centre. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy S11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Unitary Development Plan Saved Polices (November 2012) and Policy 2.15 of the London Plan (2015).",
    "The proposal by reason of the lack of detail in relation to the location of a suitable extract flue, fails to demonstrate that the increased use for hot food takeaway would not result in an unacceptable loss of residential amenity to nearby resident, contrary to Policies OE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Unitary Development Plan Saved Policies (November 2012).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant saved policies (referred to as policies from the Hillingdon Unitary Development Plan - Saved Policies September 2007), then London Plan Policies (2016).  On the 8th November 2012 Hillingdon's Full Council agreed the adoption of the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies. Appendix 5 of this explains which saved policies from the old Unitary Development (which was subject to a direction from Secretary of State in September 2007 agreeing that the policies were 'saved') still apply for development control decisions.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the 'Saved' UDP 2007, Local Plan Part 1, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service."
