    "The advertisement by reason of its siting, size, scale, design and level of illumination would appear as a visually prominent and obtrusive feature that would detract from the character and appearance of the street scene and the setting and significance of the Old Uxbridge and Windsor Street Conservation Area, the Grade II listed former Crown and Sceptre Public House and Grade II listed 134 and 135 High Street resulting in less than substantial harm to the setting of these heritage assets that would not be outweighed by the public benefits of the proposal, contrary to Policies DMHB 1, DMHB 4; DHHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHB 13A of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020);  Policies D1, D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021) and the relevant provisions of the NPPF 2024, in particular paragraphs 135, 139, 141, and 215.",
