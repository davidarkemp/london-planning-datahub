    "The advertisement by reason of its siting, size, scale, design and level of illumination would appear as a visually prominent and obtrusive feature that would detract from the character and appearance of the street scene and the setting and significance of the Old Uxbridge and Windsor Street Conservation Area, the Grade II* listed Market House and Church of St Margaret; and the Grade II listed Uxbridge Underground Station and Telephone Booths resulting in a moderate level of less than substantial harm to the setting of these heritage assets that would not be outweighed by the public benefits of the proposal, contrary to Policies DMHB 1, DMHB 4; DHHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHB 13A of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020);  Policies D1, D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021) and the relevant provisions of the NPPF 2023, in particular paragraphs 139, 141, 208.",
