    "The Copper Beech is situated within the rear garden of 137 Long Lane along the boundary with Court Drive. Long Lane is a main trunk road through the borough and Court Drive is used frequently as a cut through and parking for parents picking up their children from local schools. As a result, this Beech has a high amenity value and significantly contributes to the arboreal character of the area.",
    "The Beech appears to have a natural canopy typical of its species, the applicant has ticked yes to \"Condition of the tree(s) - e.g. it is diseased or you have fears that it might break or fall\" however no technical evidence has been provided to corroborate this claim and a site visit to assess the application does not agree with this statement. It is noted that the applicant mentions dead branches are falling on the neighbour's car, the removal of deadwood is exempt from the application process and these dead branches can be removed at any time.",
