  "description": "Installation of vehicular crossover to front.",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed vehicle crossover by reason of vehicles reversing in or out of the site into oncoming traffic, close to a junction, and the increase in the number of potential conflict points along the road would result in the disruption of the free flow of traffic and would be detrimental to highway and pedestrian safety contrary to Policies DMT 1 and DMT 2 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "In the absence of a Tree Survey and Arboricultural Implication Assessment to BS5837: 2005 standards, the application has failed to demonstrate that the development will safeguard existing trees on the site and further fails to demonstrate protection for long-term retention of the trees.  The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies DMHB 11 and DMHB 14 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "The proposal does not specify that the front drive materials are permeable. In the absence of this information the development is contrary to Policy DMEI 10 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2016). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service."
