    "The Copper Beech is situated within the rear garden of 137 Long Lane along the boundary with Court Drive. Long Lane is a main trunk road through the borough and Court Drive is used frequently as a cut through and parking for parents picking up their children from local schools. As a result, this Beech has a high amenity value and significantly contributes to the arboreal character of the area.",
    "The Beech appears to have a natural canopy typical of its species, the applicant has ticked yes to \"Condition of the tree(s) - e.g. it is diseased or you have fears that it might break or fall\" however no technical evidence has been provided to corroborate this claim and a site visit to assess the application does not agree with this statement.",
    "No reasons have been given for the proposed work, as a result the work is unjustified and will have a detrimental impact on the visual amenity and arboreal character of the area",
