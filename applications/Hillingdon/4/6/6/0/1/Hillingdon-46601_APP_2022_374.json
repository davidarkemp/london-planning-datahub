    "The proposed two storey side extension, by reason of its size, scale, bulk, height, width and design on this open, prominent position, would fail to read as a subordinate addition to the property and would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original dwelling. As a result the extension would be detrimental to the character, appearance and symmetry of the pair of semi-detached dwellings and to the visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 11 and  DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and Policies D4 and D8 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "The proposed development, by virtue of its size, scale, bulk, depth and proximity, would be detrimental to the amenities of the adjoining occupier at 4 Raeburn Road by reason of overdominance, visual intrusion, loss of light and loss of outlook. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to policies Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 11 and  DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The proposed extensions would, by virtue of their failure to maintain an adequate amount of private usable external amenity space for the occupiers of the existing property, result in over-development of the site detrimental to the residential amenity of the existing occupiers. The proposal is therefore contrary to policies DMHD1 and DMHB11 and DMHB18 of the Hillingdon Local Plan - Part Two (2020).",
    "The proposal has not demonstrated that sufficient off street parking/manoeuvring/access arrangements would be provided, and therefore the development is considered to result in substandard car parking provision to the Councils approved car parking standard, leading to possible on-street parking and potential queuing to the detriment of highway and pedestrian safety and contrary to policy DMT6 of the Hillingdon Local Plan - part Two (2020) and Policy T6 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
