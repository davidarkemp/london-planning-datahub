    "The application submission fails to fully demonstrate that the proposal would not give rise to adverse impacts upon the highway network to the detriment of traffic congestion, parking stress and highway safety. Based on the information submitted, the proposed development is considered to have an unacceptable impact on highway safety. As such, the proposal is contrary to Policies DMT 1, DMT 2 and DME 4 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 (2020), and Policies T2, T4 and T5 of the London Plan (2021), and is refused in accordance with paragraph 111 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The proposed development would likely contribute to the production of unacceptable pollutant emissions in the Northwood West Air Quality Focus Area and the Northwood East Air Quality Focus Area. Given the uncertainty in the trip generation associated with the operation of the development, it is not possible to ascertain the full measure of transport emissions into the atmosphere and whether the proposed development would be air quality neutral. Further, the proposed development is not air quality positive and the measures proposed are not sufficient to mitigate the total emissions. As such, the development is contrary to Policy EM8 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 (2012), Policy DMEI 14 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 (2020), Policy SI 1 of the London Plan (2021) and paragraphs 174(e) and 186 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The applicant has failed to secure Section 106 planning obligations required to mitigate the harm and demands created by the proposed development (in respect of travel planning, highways management, air quality, and project management and monitoring). The scheme therefore conflicts with Policy DMCI 7 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 (2020); the adopted Planning Obligations Supplementary Planning Document (2014); Policy DF1 of the London Plan (2021); and paragraphs 54-57 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan (2021) and national guidance.",
