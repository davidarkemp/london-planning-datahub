    "The proposed development, by reason of the loss of historic fabric, would fail to preserve the significance of the Grade II Listed Building by posing 'less than substantial harm' to the significance of the designated heritage asset. Further, the proposed development is not considered to provide deliverable public benefits sufficient to outweigh the harm posed. As such, the proposal is contrary to Policy HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 (2012), Policies DMHB 1, DMHB 2 and DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 (2020), Policy HC1 of the London Plan (2021) and Paragraphs 205 and 208 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023).",
