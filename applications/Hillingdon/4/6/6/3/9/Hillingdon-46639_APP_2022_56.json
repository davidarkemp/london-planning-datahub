    "The proposed development, by reason of the loss of historic fabric, would fail to preserve the significance of the Grade II Listed Building by posing 'less than substantial harm' to the significance of the designated heritage asset. Further, the proposed development is not considered to provide deliverable public benefits sufficient to outweigh the harm posed. As such, the proposal is contrary to Policy HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 (2012), Policies DMHB 1, DMHB 2 and DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 (2020), Policy HC1 of the London Plan (2021) and paragraphs 199 and 202 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The decision to REFUSE Listed Building Consent has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE Listed Buidling Consent has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan (2021) and national guidance.",
    "The proposed works to the Listed Building would cause less than substantial harm but could enable a change of use to a community and religious which would in turn realise public benefit if deemed acceptable. Significantly, this use is not acceptable in all other respects and is not therefore deliverable. It follows that the public benefit would not be realised and it is not considered that the heritage benefits secured through the proposed works would be sufficient on their own to outweigh the harm posed.",
    "As part of the decision making process the Local Planning Authority have taken due regard to the public sector equality duty of the Equality Act 2010."
