    "The proposed new roof and associated dormers, by reason of its bulk, size, massing, height and design, would result in a top heavy, overly dominant and discordant roof form which fails to respect the existing architectural composition of the host building, harming the character and appearance of the streetscene and wider Area of Special Local Character, contrary to Policies DMHD1, DMHB 5, DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two: Development Management Policies (2020) and Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part One (2012)",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service. We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
