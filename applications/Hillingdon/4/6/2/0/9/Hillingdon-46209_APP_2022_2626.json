    "The proposed rear extension, by reason of its bulk, size and siting along the boundary, would fail to preserve the residential amenities of No.31 Fairfield Road, causing a harmful sense of enclosure and overshadowing to important amenity areas, alongside a potential loss of privacy given a raised platform would be required. The rear extension as a whole would fail to comply with Policies DMHD1 and DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two: Development Management Policies (2020)."
