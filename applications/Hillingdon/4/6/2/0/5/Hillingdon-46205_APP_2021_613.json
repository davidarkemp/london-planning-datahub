    "The details received pursuant to Condition 7 (Landscaping) are considered insufficient in that there are inconsistencies between the hard and soft landscaping plans and parking and footpath layouts in the submitted plans. Furthermore, the proposed railings to the frontage, in terms of their height are not considered to be in character with the street scene and the proposed cycle shelter is considered unsuitable for a residential use. In the absence of acceptable landscaping details, the scheme fails to comply with Policy DMHB 14 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020)."
