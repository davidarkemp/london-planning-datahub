  "description": "Two storey rear extension and enlargement of habitable roofspace to include 2 rear dormers, 3 side rooflights, central roof lantern and alterations to elevations",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed rear extension by reason of its size, scale, bulk and design, would be an intrusive addition to the property which would fail to harmonise with the existing character of the original dwelling, the group of three properties of which it forms a part and the wider street scene. The proposal therefore fails to either preserve or enhance the character or appearance of the Northwood Town Conservation Area and would be contrary to Policies BE1 and HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 4, DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The proposed two storey rear extension by virtue of its depth, height and proximity, would be detrimental to the amenities of the adjoining occupiers at no. 18 by reason of overdominance, loss of outlook and loss of light. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The proposal would provide an indoor living area of an unsatisfactory quality for the future occupiers and would therefore give rise to a substandard form of living accommodation to the detriment of the amenity of future occupiers. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and to Policy 3.5 of the London Plan (2016).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2016). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service."
