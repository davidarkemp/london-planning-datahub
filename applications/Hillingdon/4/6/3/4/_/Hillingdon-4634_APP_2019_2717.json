  "description": "Installation of a 20m monopole, 12 antenna apertures, 8 equipment cabinets and 10 concrete bollards and the retention of 2 equipment cabinets following the removal of the existing 14.7m monopole, 3 antennas and redundant equipment cabinets",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed development, by reason of the siting in this visually prominent position, quantity, size and scale of the equipment cabinets and concrete bollards, would create an obtrusive form of development which would add visual clutter to the detriment of the character, appearance and visual amenities of the street scene and would fail to either preserve or enhance the character or appearance of the surrounding West Drayton Green Conservation Area. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies BE1 and HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies BE4, BE13 and BE37 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Saved UDP Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 1, DMHB 4, DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHB 21 of the emerging Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies with Modifications (March 2019), Policy 7.8 of the London Plan (2016) and the NPPF.",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Unitary Development Plan Saved Policies (November 2012) as incorporated into the Hillingdon Local Plan (2012) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan - The Spatial Development Strategy for London consolidated with alterations since 2011 (2016) and national guidance."
