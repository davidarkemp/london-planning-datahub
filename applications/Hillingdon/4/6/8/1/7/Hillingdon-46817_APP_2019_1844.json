    "The proposed extension by reason of its size, internal layout, provision of facilities within, independent access and separate internal staircase, is considered capable of independent occupation from the main dwelling and is thus tantamount to a separate dwelling in a position where such a dwelling would not be accepted due to requirements for parking and amenity space and the impact on the adjoining properties. It therefore results in an overdevelopment of the site, out of character with the spacious character and layout of the area and contrary to Policies AM14, BE13, BE15, BE19, BE21, BE23 and BE24 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Saved UDP Policies (November 2012) and to the Council's adopted Supplementary Planning Documents HDAS: Residential Extensions and HDAS: Residential Layouts.",
    "The proposed extension by reason of its forward projection and front dormer, would result in a visually incongruous addition which would fail to appear as a subordinate addition and would thus be detrimental to the appearance of the original house, the visual amenities of the street scene and the character and appearance of the wider area. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies BE13, BE15 and BE19 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Saved UDP Policies (November 2012) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Documents HDAS: Residential Extensions.",
    "The proposal has not demonstrated that sufficient off street parking/manoeuvring/access arrangements would be provided, and therefore the development is considered to result in substandard car parking provision to the Council's approved car parking standard, leading to on-street parking/queuing to the detriment of public and highway safety and contrary to Policies AM7 and AM14 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Unitary Development Plan Saved Policies (November 2012) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Documents HDAS: Residential Extensions and HDAS: Residential Layouts.",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant saved policies (referred to as policies from the Hillingdon Unitary Development Plan - Saved Policies September 2007), then London Plan Policies (2016).  On the 8th November 2012 Hillingdon's Full Council agreed the adoption of the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies. Appendix 5 of this explains which saved policies from the old Unitary Development (which was subject to a direction from Secretary of State in September 2007 agreeing that the policies were 'saved') still apply for development control decisions.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the 'Saved' UDP 2007, Local Plan Part 1, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service. This is a resubmission of a previously refused scheme, where the Officers Report identified issues to be addressed, which were reflected in the reasons for refusal, allowing the opportunity to address those issues within this submission."
