    "The proposed two storey rear extension, by virtue of  its excessive size, height, scale, bulk and flat roofed design, would constitute a visually obtrusive and incongruous form of development which would engulf and subsume the original dwelling detracting from its architectural integrity. The proposals would also fail to respond to the established character, shared group value and context, and would be at odds with both adjacent dwellings, causing harm to the character and appearance of the building and locality.  The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 11, DMHD 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The proposed two storey rear extension, by reason of its bulk, depth, proximity and scale, would harm the amenities of No.42 Mount Pleasant by reason of overdominance and increased sense of enclosure, failing to maintain a satisfactory relationship with this neighbour, contrary to Policy DMHB 11 and DMHD 1  of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service. This is a resubmission of a previously refused scheme, where the Officers Report identified issues to be addressed, which were reflected in the reasons for refusal, allowing the opportunity to address those issues within this submission."
