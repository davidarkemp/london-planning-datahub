  "description": "Single storey rear extension and single storey outbuilding to rear for use as a home office/gym",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed single storey rear extension and outbuilding both individually and cumulatively by virtue of their size, scale, bulk and depth would result in an overdevelopment of the site and the proposed proposed extension and outbuilding would involve the substantial loss of the existing rear garden and would fail to appear subservient to the main property. The proposals would therefore be harmful to the character and appearance of the existing property and the wider area. As such the proposals would be contrary to Policies DMHB 11, DMHD 1, DMHD 2 and DMHB 18 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies.",
    "Cumulatively the proposed single storey rear extension and outbuilding, by virtue of their size, scale, bulk, depth and proximity, would be detrimental to the amenities of the adjoining occupiers at 42 and 46 White Butts Road by reason of overdominance, overshadowing, visual intrusion, loss of light and loss of outlook. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies.",
    "Cumulatively the proposed single storey rear extension and outbuilding, by virtue of their size, scale and depth and would result in the unacceptable loss of private amenity space for the host property resulting in harm to the amenity of the existing and future occupants. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policy DMHB 18 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies.",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan - The Spatial Development Strategy for London consolidated with alterations since 2011 (2016) and national guidance.",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2016). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020."
