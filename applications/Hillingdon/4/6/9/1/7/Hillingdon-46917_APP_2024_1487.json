    "To safeguard the visual amenities of the area and to ensure that the proposed development does not have an adverse effect upon the appearance of the existing building in accordance with Policy DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 (2020)",
    "For the lifetime of the development hereby permitted the rating level (LAr) of noise caused by its operation shall not exceed: 40 dB LAr 15 min for any fifteen-minute period between 2300 and 0700, and 50 dB LAr 1 hour for any one-hour period between 0700 and 2300, determined one metre free field external to any window or door of any permanent residential, or equivalently noise sensitive premises, in accordance with 'Methods for rating and assessing industrial and commercial sound' British Standards Institution BS4142 2014.'",
    "REASON: To ensure that occupants of dwellings would not be exposed to noise caused by the permitted development that would be likely to cause an adverse effect on their health and quality of life with windows open for the purposes of ventilation and cooling.",
    "For the lifetime of the development hereby permitted, all elements of the kitchen extract system shall be installed, retained and maintained in accordance with the design submitted and the manufacturer's instruction.",

    "It is considered that a condition based on fixed noise levels is consistent with noise and planning policy by relating external noise levels to the point at which adverse effects on health and quality of life start to be observed. The limit values are intended to be consistent with the evidence base that formed the bases for the guidelines published by the WHO in 1999 and 2009 the former being reflected in guidance: 'Guidance on Sound Insulation and Noise Reduction for Buildings' BS8233 2014. This is combined with the assessment principles and procedures detailed in guidance: 'Methods for rating and assessing industrial and commercial sound' British Standards Institution BS4142 2014.' This is used to set reference time periods for the assessment and adjust measured or calculated LAeq values for character as detailed in BS4142.",
