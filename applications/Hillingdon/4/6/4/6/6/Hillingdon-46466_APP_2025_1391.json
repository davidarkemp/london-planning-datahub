    "The proposed development, by virtue of the failure to submit a flood risk assessment, does not demonstrate that the development is appropriately flood resilient and resistant, safe for its users for the development's lifetime, and will not increase flood risk overall. The development would therefore be contrary to Policies DMEI 9 and DMEI 10 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy SI 12 of the London Plan (2021), the Flood Risk and Coastal Change section of the National Planning Policy Guidance and Paragraph 181 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2024).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "In order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably. In addition further guidance was offered to the applicant by the case officer during the processing of the application to identify the amendments to address those elements of the scheme considered unacceptable which the applicant chose not to implement.",
