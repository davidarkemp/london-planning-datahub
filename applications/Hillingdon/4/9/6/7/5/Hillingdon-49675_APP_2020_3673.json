  "description": "Subdivision of the site and the construction of a 2 storey, 4 bedroom dwellinghouse with associated rear and front garden space and front driveway parking",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed development, by virtue of its siting (in a rear garden), layout, scale, bulk, mass and design, would disrupt the established pattern of development within the immediate setting of the site, and would result in an incongruous form of development which would be out of character with the existing local context of the surrounding area. The proposal would therefore have a detrimental impact on the character, appearance and local distinctiveness of the residential area as a whole, contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), Policies 3.5, 7.1 and 7.4 of the London Plan (2016), Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies (2012) and Policies DMH 6, DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management",
    "Policies (2020).",
    "The proposed development, by virtue of its overall size, scale, bulk, siting, orientation, proximity to the shared site boundary lines and location of windows would cause unacceptable harm to the living conditions of the neighbouring properties at numbers 24 and 26 Beech Close and numbers 31, 31A, 31B and 33 Blackthorn Avenue, in terms of loss of light, outlook, privacy, overbearing effect, over dominance and sense of enclosure. The proposed development would therefore be contrary to Policy DMHB 11 of the adopted Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2019).",
    "The proposed development fails to provide accessible off-street parking provision due to a substandard access arrangement, and  insufficient evidence has been submitted to demonstrate that the proposed development would not exacerbate the demand for street parking in the area, which in turn, would have a harmful effect on highway safety. The proposal therefore conflicts with paragraph",
    "109 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), Policies 6.3 and 6.13 of the London Plan (2016) and Policies DMT 1, DMT 2 and DMT 6 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The proposal has not demonstrated that the dwelling, by reason of its size, design and layout would provide a dwelling which meets the requirements of people with disabilities. The proposal would, therefore, give rise to a substandard form of living accommodation to the detriment of the amenity of future occupiers. The proposal is thus contrary to Policies 3.8 and 7.2 of the London Plan (2016).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2016). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020.",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan - The Spatial Development Strategy for London consolidated with alterations since 2011 (2016) and national guidance."
