    "The Giant Redwood is located within the front garden of Tudor Lodge, Murray Road, Northwood. The tree represents a prominent landscape feature for the residents of Murray Road, being one of the largest trees within the road. The Redwood presents a well-developed and attractive crown which greatly contributes to the arboreal character of the area. The tree provides great benefits in amenity and biodiversity of the area which are both present and future because the Redwood has the potential for long-life expectancy.",
    "The tree presents an aesthetically attractive crown, which received some minor pruning in the past, mainly consisting in crown-lifting to a maximum of 4m. The crown lifting above window-height requested in the current application is considered excessive, as it would deprive the tree of a large section of the crown, therefore significantly affecting the appearance of the tree and its amenity value.",
    "Having regard to the reasons given for the proposed work, the work is unjustifi",
    "The removal of deadwood, dangerous / hanging branches and ivy:  This does not require the formal consent of the Council.",
    "Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981:  Note that it is an offence under this act to disturb roosting bats, nesting birds or any other protected species.",
    "Statutory crown lifting of trees: This does not require formal consent of the Council if the clearance only involves the removal of branches to give a separation between the footway and the tips of the lowest branches by up to 2.3m or the carriageway by up to 5.2m."
