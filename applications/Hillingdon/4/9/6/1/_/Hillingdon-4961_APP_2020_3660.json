  "description": "First floor rear extension, conversion of garage/garden store into garden room and installation of vehicular crossover to front",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed first floor rear extension by reason of its siting in this visually prominent position, size, scale, bulk, width and depth would constitute a visually obtrusive and incongruous form of development which would harmful to the character and appearance of the existing property and to the visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 11, DMHD 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The proposed extension, by virtue of its size, scale, bulk, depth and proximity, would be detrimental to the amenities of the adjoining occupier at 367 Uxbridge Road by reason of overdominance, overshadowing, visual intrusion, loss of light and loss of outlook. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The proposed crossover and its associated parking spaces in the rear garden of the site would lead to the unacceptable loss of private amenity space and would fail to maintain an adequate amount of private usable external amenity space for the occupiers of the extended property and would thus result in an over-development of the site detrimental to the residential amenity of existing and future occupiers. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies DMHD 1 and DMHB 18 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "The proposed conversion of the existing garage and store would result in the creation of a detached structure, which, by reason of its size, scale, layout and independent access, is considered capable of independent occupation from the main dwelling and is thus tantamount to a separate dwelling in a position where such a dwelling would not be acceptable as it could result in unacceptable impact on adjoining occupiers and additional requirements for parking and amenity space. The proposal is therefore contrary to policies DMHB 11, DMHD 2, DMHB 18 and DMT 6 of the London Borough of Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two-Development Management Policies and Policy 3.5 of the London Plan.",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2016). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020."
