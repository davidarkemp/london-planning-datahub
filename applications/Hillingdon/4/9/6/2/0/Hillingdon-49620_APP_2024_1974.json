    "The proposed side extension, by reason of size, design and location with regard to the original front building line of the terrace house, would fail to constitute a subservient addition to the host dwelling and would result in a visually incongruous form of development that would be detrimental to the character and appearance of the original property and surrounding area. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2021), Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management (2020), Policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021) and Chapter 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023).",
    "The proposed development would fail to provide an acceptable living environment for future residents of the site, by reason that the proposed ground floor flat would not provide adequate residential floorspace that meets the minimum internal floor area requirements and the proposed loft bedroom within the first floor flat may not meet the minimum headroom requirements. In addition, the proposed first floor flat would have poor access to private outdoor amenity space rendering the space as unusable. The occupiers of the new flats would therefore be subject to a poor standard of living accommodation to the detriment of their residential amenity and the development would be contrary to Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021), Policies DMHB 15 and DMHB 18 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), and paragraph 135 (f) of the NPPF (2023).",
    "The development would lead to an unacceptable residential conversion where the internal floor area of the original building to be converted is less than 120 sqm and the proposed conversion would result in the loss of a three-bedroom dwelling house for which there is an established need in the Borough. The development would therefore be contrary to Policy DMH 4 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan - The Spatial Development Strategy for London consolidated with alterations since 2011 (2016) and national guidance."
