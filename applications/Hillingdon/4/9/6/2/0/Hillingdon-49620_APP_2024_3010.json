    "In the absence of existing and proposed block plans, and accurate and consistent proposed floor plans and elevations, the proposed two-storey side extension, by reason of size, design, and location would appear to be unreasonably close (800mm) to the shared side boundary and flank wall of the neighbouring property and would not be set back by at least 1000m from the main front wall of the dwelling as to provide appropriate definition between the original house and the proposed extension. This would result in an overly dominant form of development that would be detrimental to the residential amenity of the neighbouring property and create an incongruous built form that could harm the area's character. The proposal is, therefore, contrary to Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021) and Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management (2020).",
    "The proposed development would fail to provide acceptable access for future residents of the site as the proposed front garden landscaping, with a planting strip and hardstanding to accommodate a parked car, would obstruct access to the property's side and rear garden. Therefore, future occupants would be subject to a poor standard of living accommodation to the detriment of their residential amenity. The development would be contrary to Policies DMHB 11 and DMHB 14 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The two proposed bin stores would be detrimental to the character and appearance of the surrounding area because of the proximity to the street, excessive waste storage provision for a single dwelling, and the Applicant's failure to provide material and dimension details. The proposal is, therefore, contrary to Policies DMHB 11 and DMHB 14 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management (2020).",
    "The proposed floor plans and elevations are inconsistent, and the Applicant has failed to provide existing and proposed block plans. Therefore, the Applicant has failed to provide sufficient information as required under article 7(1)(c)(ii) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure (England) (Order) 2015 and the Hillingdon Local Planning Validation Checklist for the Council to undertake a fully informed and accurate assessment.",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan - The Spatial Development Strategy for London consolidated with alterations since 2011 (2016) and national guidance."
