    "The proposed development by reason of its excessive size, scale, bulk, depth and height would represent an unneighbourly form of development for the occupiers of No.4 Marlborough Parade and in this respect would be contrary with policies BE20 and BE24 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Saved UDP Policies (November 2012) and Policy Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies with Modifications (March 2019).",
    "The proposed development, fails to address operation and servicing issues in terms of refuse disposal and collection arrangements. The site is proposed to be fully covered in buildings and hence there will be no external space left to use for refuse storage. It is considered that the development would fail to meet the standards set under the emerging Policy DMTC 3: Maintaining the Viability of Local Centres and Local Parades of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies with Modifications (March 2019).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Unitary Development Plan Saved Policies (September 2007) as incorporated into the Hillingdon Local Plan (2012) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan - The Spatial Development Strategy for London consolidated with alterations since 2011 (2016) and national guidance.",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant saved policies (referred to as policies from the Hillingdon Unitary Development Plan - Saved Policies September 2007), then London Plan Policies (2016).  On the 8th November 2012 Hillingdon's Full Council agreed the adoption of the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies. Appendix 5 of this explains which saved policies from the old Unitary Development (which was subject to a direction from Secretary of State in September 2007 agreeing that the policies were 'saved') still apply for development control decisions."
