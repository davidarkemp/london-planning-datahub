  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed development, by reason of its siting in a visually prominent position, scale, height, mass and design, would result in a visually intrusive form of development, which would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original building and would be detrimental to the character, appearance and visual amenities of this existing area as a whole. The proposal is thus contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), Policies 3.5 and 7.4 of the London Plan and the NPPF.",
    "The proposed development, by virtue of its siting, size, scale, bulk and proximity, would be detrimental to the amenities of the adjoining occupiers at 33 to 43 Tolcarne Drive, by reason of visual intrusion, overdominance and loss of outlook. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policies DMHB 11 of the  Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020)",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2016). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020."
