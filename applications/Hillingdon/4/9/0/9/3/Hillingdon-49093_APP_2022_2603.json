    "The roof alterations/extension, by reason of its overall width, height, size, scale, bulk, design, would result in an insubordinate, disproportionate and bulky addition that would be harmful to the character and appearance of the original dwelling and would be detrimental to the visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local plan - Part Two (2020), Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021) and Paragraph 134 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",

    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2021). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020.",

We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "In order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably. In addition further guidance was offered to the applicant by the case officer during the processing of the application to identify the amendments to address those elements of the scheme considered unacceptable which the applicant chose not to implement."
