Therefore, the proposed development would be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan (November 2012), Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan - Part Two (2020), Section 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021) and Policies D3 and D6 of the London Plan (2021).",

    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
