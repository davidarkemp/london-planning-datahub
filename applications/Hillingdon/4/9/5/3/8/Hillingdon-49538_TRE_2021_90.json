  "decision_conditions": [
    "Approved - To fell three Hornbeams (T1, T2, T4 on application) all within Area 1 on TPO 400",
    "Refused  - To reduce height by 1/3rd four Hornbeams (T3, T5, T6, T7 on application) all within Area 1 on TPO 400",
    "All seven Hornbeams are situated within the rear garden of White Lodge, Northgate. The three marked for removal appear to be in poor health and as a result have a low amenity value. The other four have a moderate (collective) amenity value and significantly contribute to the arboreal character of the Copse wood Estate, an Area of Special Local Character.",
    "With regards to the height reductions/reshapes to four hornbeams (T3, T5, T6 and T7 on the application) the applicants reasons behind why the work is required is excessive shade, however the trees are located to the rear of the garden and surrounded by a number of other trees, in particular a larger Oak, as a result it is not believed that reductions of these hornbeams will make much difference to any perceived light issues. Reductions would however unnecessarily introduce multiple wounds into their crowns, which would likely cause stress and lead to infection, affecting their long-term health; this would affect the safe useful life",
    "No felling shall take place until such time as a scheme has been submitted to, and approved in writing by, the Local Planning Authority for a replacement tree(s), which shall be of 'Standard' size (about 2-3m high) and short-staked for support. The replacement tree shall be planted during the first planting season following the felling works hereby permitted. Thereafter, the replacement tree(s) shall be retained indefinitely and maintained (watered and weeded during the spring and summer) for 2-3 years, or until established.",
    "REASON",
    "In order to comply with the requirements of Section 206 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990.",
    "The removal of deadwood, dangerous / hanging branches and ivy:  This does not require the formal consent of the Council.",
    "Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981:  Note that it is an offence under this act to disturb roosting bats, nesting birds or any other protected species.  Therefore, if applicable, it is advisable to consult your tree surgeon / consultant to agree an acceptable time for carrying out the approved works."
