    "The proposed development, by virtue of its cumulative scale, bulk and massing, would appear as an insubordinate, dominant and incongruous form of development that would be harmful to the character and appearance of the host dwelling and fail to harmonise with the local context in terms of the surrounding scale, massing and bulk of adjacent built forms. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHD 1, DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020) and Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "The proposed two storey side/rear extension, would be harmful on the residential amenity of the neighbouring occupiers at No.9 The Paddock by reason of loss of outlook and creating a sense of enclosure. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local plan - Part Two (2020) and Policy D3 of the London plan (2021).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2021). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020."
