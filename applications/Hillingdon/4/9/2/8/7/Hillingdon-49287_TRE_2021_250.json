    "The Copper Beech is situated within the rear garden of 13 Arden Mhor. This tree is a large specimen with a mature and attractive crown which is visible from multiple corners, including properties within Arden Mhor and Catlin's Lane. The tree has a high-to-very-high amenity value and provides a great contribution to the arboreal character of the local area, enriched by its mature tree canopy cover.",
    "The crown of this Beech appears healthy and in good condition. A crown reduction by 4m of this tree is considered excessive and no arboricultural reasons have been supplied to justify the proposed works.",
    "Pruning would unnecessarily introduce large multiple wounds into the crown, which would likely cause stress and lead to infection, potentially altering the long-term health of the tree. This would impact the safe useful life expectancy of this tree. Pruning would also result in weakly attached re-growth forming that would be prone to future failure.",
