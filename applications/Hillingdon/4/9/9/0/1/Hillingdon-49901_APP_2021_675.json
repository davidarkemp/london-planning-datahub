  "description": "Part two storey, part single storey side/rear extension",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed two storey side extension, by virtue of its size, scale, bulk, width and proximity to the site boundary, would be result in a overly wide and incongruous feature which would reduce the visual gap between it and the neighbouring property No. 58 and would involve the loss of an important architectural feature. As such the development would be harmful to the character and appearance of the existing property and the street scene as well as the character and appearance of the Copse Wood Estate Area of Special Local Character. The development would therefore be contrary to policies DMHD 1, DMHB 5, DMHB 6, DMHB 12 and DMHB 11 Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "In the absence of a tree report and arboricultural impact assessment the applicant has failed to demonstrate that the trees will be unaffected by the development and has not made provision for their long term protection. As such the proposed development would be harmful to the character and appearance of the site and the wider Copse Wood Estate Area of Special Local Character. The development would therefore be contrary to policies DMHB 6 and DMHB 14 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2021). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020."
