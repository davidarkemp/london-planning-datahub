    "The proposed outbuilding, by reason of its excessive footprint, bulk, size, mass and height would fail to read as a proportionate, incidental building of a high standard of design, failing to preserve or enhance the character and appearance of the conservation area. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHD2, DMHB 4 and DMHB11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan - Part Two (2020).",
    "The Applicant has failed to demonstrate that the proposed outbuilding would have an acceptable impact on trees of special amenity value which are protected due to their siting in a conservation area under the provisions in section 211 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies DMHD 2 and DMHB 14 of the Hillingdon Local Plan - Part Two (2020).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "In order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably. In addition further guidance was offered to the applicant by the case officer during the processing of the application to identify the amendments to address those elements of the scheme considered unacceptable. However, the amendments required to make the application acceptable are substantial and would materially change the development proposal. They would require further consultation to be undertaken pri"
