This tree has a moderate amenity value and is highly visible from all sides, making a good contribution to the visual amenity and arboreal character of the local area.",

Furthermore, no substantive evidence has been provided in the form of written arboricultural advice from an appropriate expert or other diagnostic information which demonstrates why this tree requires removal. This proposed work may also set an undesirable precedent for felling other large, mature trees in the area, which would also be detrimental to the longer-term visual amenity and arboreal character of the area.",
