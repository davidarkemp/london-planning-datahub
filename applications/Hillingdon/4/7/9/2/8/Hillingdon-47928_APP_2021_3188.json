    "The proposed side dormer window, by virtue of its scale, siting, design and bulk, would form an incongruous form of development which would be detrimental to the form of the original roof and fail to respect the architectural integrity of the original dwelling, would result in the loss of an important gap between the dwelling and side boundary at roof level and would represent an incongruous addition to the streetscene. As such, the proposal would adversely affect the appearance of the dwelling, the visual amenity of the street scene and the character of the area, contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 1, DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020) and policies D4 and D8 of the London Plan (2021).",
