    "The proposed outbuilding by reason of its footprint, scale, width, height, design and setback from the frontage with Delamere Road, would result in an incongruous, dominant, disproportionate and visually intrusive addition that would fail to harmonise or remain incidental to the original dwelling and would be detrimental to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area. Therefore, the proposal would be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020)."
