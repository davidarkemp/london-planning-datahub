    "The decision to GRANT planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",

    "3)      in some circumstances, carry out groundworks within 6 metres of an adjoining building.",
    "Notification and agreements under this Act are the responsibility of the building owner and are quite separate from Building Regulations or planning controls. Building Control will assume that an applicant has obtained any necessary agreements with the adjoining owner, and nothing said or implied by Building Control should be taken as removing the necessity for the building owner to comply fully with the Act."
