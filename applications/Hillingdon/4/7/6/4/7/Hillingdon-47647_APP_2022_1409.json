    "The development proposal due to the siting, design, materials and construction would result in 'less than substantial harm' to the setting of the Listed Building, would fail to preserve the appearance and character of the Conservation Area and would harm the general visual amenities of the area. As there are no longer exceptional circumstances to justify the development proposal and no public benefits identified to outweigh the harm, the development proposal would conflict with Policies BE1 and HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies (2012), Policies DMHB 1, DMHB 2, DMHB 4 and DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020) and Paragraph 202 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
