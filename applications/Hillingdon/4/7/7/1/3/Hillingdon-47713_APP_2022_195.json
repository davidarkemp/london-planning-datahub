    "The development leads to an unacceptable residential conversion where more than one residential unit has been proposed per floor. The residential conversion is also sited on a street where more than 10% of the properties are in use as flats. The development is therefore contrary to the requirements of Policy DMH 4 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020) and would harm the local character and amenity of the area by resulting in a concentration of flats.",
    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate adequate visibility splays for cars and pedestrians combined with poor access to the proposed cycle storage. Therefore the proposal would exacerbate parking stress in the area and be prejudicial to all road users safety, contrary to Policies DMT 1, DMT 2, DMT 5 and DMT 6 of the Hillingdon Local Plan - Part Two (2020) and Policies T4 and T5 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "The proposed development, by virtue of the location of the on-site car parking spaces directly in front of the main habitable room window serving Flat 1, in combination with the need for residents to gain pedestrian access to the communal path at the side of the building, would cause unacceptable noise, disturbance, overlooking and a loss of privacy (both real and perceived) for the future occupants of Flat 1. The proposal would therefore result in a substandard form of internal residential accommodation to the detriment of the amenity of the future occupiers of Flat 1 contrary to Policies DMHB 15 and DMHB 16 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The proposed layout of the rear amenity spaces combined with the erection of the outbuilding, by reason of this excessive subdivision, and the bulk and mass of the proposed outbuilding, would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original dwelling and would be harmful to the character and appearance of West Drayton Green Conservation Area. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policy BE1 and HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 4, DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan (2021) and national guidance.",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination)."
