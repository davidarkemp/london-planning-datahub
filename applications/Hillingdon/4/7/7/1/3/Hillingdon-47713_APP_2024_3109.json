    "The development would result in an increased number of occupiers, whilst reducing the quantity of internal communal amenity space, this would equate to an over-concentration of occupants on site accounting for the size of the dwelling and the proposals would therefore fail to provide adequate living accommodation, resulting in an over-concentration of occupants on site accounting for the size of the dwelling. The proposals would be contrary to Policy DMH5 and DMHB 16 of the Local Plan Part 2 - Development Management Policies; Policy D6 of the London Plan 2021; and the NPPF 2024, in particularly Paragraph 135.",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan - The Spatial Development Strategy for London consolidated with alterations since 2011 (2016) and national guidance."
