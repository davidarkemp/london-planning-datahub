    "Due to its design and layout, the proposal would result in uncharacteristic, incongruous and harmful elevational changes which fail to preserve or enhance the character and appearance of the building, pair, streetscene and wider West Drayton Green Conservation Area. The public benefits arising from the proposal fail to outweigh the less than substantial harm identified. The proposal is therefore contrary to Section 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended), paragraph 202 of the NPPF (2021), Policy HE1 and BE1 of the Local Plan Part 1 (2012), Policy DMHB 1, DMHB 4 and DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan : Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and Policy D3 and HC1 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "The proposed development, given the number of potential occupants across 8no. separate bedrooms would give rise to undue noise and general disturbance to neighbouring residents, particularly as a result of a marked increase in comings and goings from the new side entrance, the use of the rear garden and the lack of information relating to sound insulation. The proposal would therefore be contrary to the requirements of Policies DMH 5 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "Due to its size, cramped design, limited usable space and lack of privacy, bedroom 2 of the proposed HMO would provide its future occupants with a poor standard of living accommodation to the detriment of their amenities. The proposal is therefore considered to be contrary to paragraph 130 (f) of the NPPF, Policy D6 of the London Plan and Policy DMH 5 of the Hillingdon Local Plan : Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan (2021) and national guidance."
