    "The proposed dwelling and landscaping, by reason of its siting, combined height, width and depth including overall design would result in a cramped and contrived form of development that would be incongruous, dominant, overbearing, jarring and visually intrusive. This would negatively impact the relation with the host dwelling, the character and appearance of the Fairdale Gardens cul-de-sac and visual amenities of the streetscene. Therefore, the proposal would fail to comply with Policies D1, D3, D4 and H2 of the London Plan (2021), Policies BE1 and H1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012) and Policies DMH 6, DMBH 11, DMHB 12, DMHB 14, DMHB 18 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and Section 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The proposed dwelling, by reason of its siting, combined height, width and depth including overall design would be detrimental to the occupiers of no.44, 46 and 48 Mount Road in terms of sense of enclosure, visual impact, overbearing impact and loss of outlook. Therefore, the proposal would fail to comply with Policies D1, D3, D4 and H2 of the London Plan (2021), Policies BE1 and H1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012) and Policies DMH 6, DMBH 11, DMHB 12, DMHB 14, DMHB 18 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and Section 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The proposed development, by reason of the over provision of car parking and layout would result in significant highway and pedestrian safety concerns due to the tight/constrained layout of which would not allow occupiers to safely and securely manoeuvre to and from the site. Therefore, the proposal would fail to comply with Policies D3, D4, T3, T4, T5, T6 and T7 of the London Plan (2021), Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012) and Policies DMH 6, DMHB 11, DMHB 12, DMT 1, DMT 2, DMT 3, DMT 4, DMT 5 and DMT 6 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "This is a reminder that Under the terms of the Planning Act 2008 (as amended) and Community Infrastructure Levy Regulations 2010 (as amended), should an application for appeal be allowed, the proposed development would be deemed as 'chargeable development' and therefore liable to pay the London Borough of Hillingdon Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and the Mayor of London's Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This would be calculated in accordance with the London Borough of Hillingdon CIL Charging Schedule 2014 and the Mayor of London's CIL Charging Schedule 2012. For more information on CIL matters please visit the planning portal page at: www.planningportal.gov.uk/planning/applications/howtoapply/whattosubmit/cil",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2021). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020.",
    "It should be noted that the host dwelling received planning permission (47723/APP/2021/603) dated 13/04/2021 for a part single; part two-storey rear extension. This permission appears to have been implemented. However, please be advised that the determination of this planning application does not establish the lawfulness of the development shown on the submitted existing drawings, nor does it establish compliance with the planning permission. The implemented extensions are still subject to the terms and conditions granted by planning permission ref. 47723/APP/2021/603."
