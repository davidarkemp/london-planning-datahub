  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed rear and roof extensions by reason of their excessive depth, size, bulk and design, would represent disproportionate additions to the host building that would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original dwelling. The proposal would therefore be detrimental to the character and appearance of the host dwelling, and the visual amenities of the surrounding area and the character and appearance of the streetscene, all contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "The proposed development by reason of its excessive depth, size, bulk, design and proximity to neighbouring boundaries would represent an unneighbourly form of development that would harm the amenities of both No. 5 and No. 9 Dean Close through a loss of light, loss of outlook, sense of enclosure, perceived overlooking and overshadowing, all contrary to Policy DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020) and the NPPF.",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2021). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020."
