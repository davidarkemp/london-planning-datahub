    "The proposed development, given the number of potential occupants across 7 no. separate bedrooms would give rise to undue noise and general disturbance to neighbouring residents, particularly as a result of a marked increase in comings and goings, use of the rear garden and the lack of information relating to sound insulation. The proposal would therefore be contrary to the requirements of Policies DMH 5 and DMHB 16 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and paragraph 135 (f) of the NPPF (2024).",
    "In the absence of a robust transport appraisal and travel plan demonstrating that sufficient off-street parking has been provided, as required by the local parking standard for the proposed level of occupancy, the proposal has the potential to lead to undue on-street parking displacement to the detriment of parking capacity and safety on the local public highway, contrary to Local Plan: Part 2 Development Management Plan (2020) - Policies DMT 1, DMT 2 & DMT 6 (Appendix C) and Policies T4, T5 and T6  of the London Plan (2021).",
    "The proposed development has failed to demonstrate that it would provide an adequate level of outlook for the future occupiers of bedroom 6  due to its reliance solely on rooflights, which are set at high level. The proposal would therefore give rise to a substandard form of living accommodation to the detriment of the amenities of future occupiers contrary to Policy DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies and Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021)",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "The applicant is advised that the submitted plans indicate that the property has been extended in a manner which is not in accordance with the plans allowed in respect of appeal reference APP/R5510/W/21/3276492 and is thus vulnerable to enforcement action being taken by the Council."
