    "Due to its height, scale, bulk, close proximity to the site's boundaries and close proximity to the extended host dwelling, the proposed outbuilding would result in a overdevelopment of the site. The resulting site would appear cramped and out of character with surrounding sites which are generally spacious and free of this amount of development. The outbuilding would be oversized when compared with others within the area. Furthermore the development has been facilitated by the removal of a protected tree which contributed to the character and appearance of the site and area. The loss of the tree has caused harm to the character and appearance of the site and area. The proposed development is therefore considered to have an adverse impact on the visual amenities of the host dwelling, site, surrounding area and Conservation Area.  The development conflicts with Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), and Policies DMHB 1, DMHB 4, DMHB 11, D",
    "Due to its height, scale, bulk, close proximity to the site's boundaries and close proximity to the extended host dwelling, the proposed outbuilding would result in the rear garden of the host dwelling being cramped and of substandard size. The resulting rear garden would provide existing and future residents of 65 Summerhouse Lane with a poor standard of external living accommodation to the detriment of their amenities. As such, the proposal would be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One Strategic Policies (2012) and Policies DMHB 11 and DMHB 18 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), as well as paragraph 130 (f) of the NPPF (2021).",
    "The proposed development would be facilitated by the unjustified removal of a protected tree within the Harmondsworth Village Conservation Area. Insufficient information has been submitted to justify the removal of the tree. No tree replacement plan has been submitted to mitigate the loss of the tree. The loss of the tree has caused harm to the character and appearance of the site and Conservation Area. The proposed development is therefore contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 1, DMHB 4, DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHB 14 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (January 2020), Policy D3 and G7 of the London Plan and paragraph 131 of the NPPF (2021).",
