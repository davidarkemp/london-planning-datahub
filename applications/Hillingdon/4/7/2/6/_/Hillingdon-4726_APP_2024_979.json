    "The development would result in a harmful loss of garden land and due to the harm arising from the proposal, the principle of intensifying the hotel use involving the loss of existing private garden areas is considered to be unacceptable. The proposal is contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan (Part 1) 2012, Policies DME 5 and DMH 6 of the Hillingdon Local Plan (Part 2) 2020 and the National Planning Policy Framework 2023.",
    "By virtue of its substantial size, scale, footprint, height, roof form and prominent location, the development would harm the setting of the listed building resulting in less than substantial harm to the heritage asset. The Heritage Statement is deficient in detail and does not clearly outline the impact of the proposals on the setting of the designated building, and the proposal has failed to provide concise justification or demonstrate clear public benefit that could outweigh the less than substantial harm to the listed building. As such, the proposal is contrary to Section 66 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990, Section 16 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2023, Policies D3, D8 and HC1 of the London Plan 2021, Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan (Part 1) 2012 and Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHB 1, DMHB 2, DMHB 4 and DME 5 of the Hillingdon Local Plan (Part 2) 2020.",
    "There is insufficient information submitted in support of the proposed car parking arrangements such that the level of car parking may not be appropriate for the intended use, contrary to Section 9 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2023, Policy T6.1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies DMT 2, DMT 6 and DMEI 14 of the Hillingdon Local Plan (Part 2) 2020.",
    "In the absence of an Arboricultural Impact Assessment and Tree Protection measures, the development would fail to satisfactory secure the protection of retained trees. The development would result in the unjustified removal of a number of trees and landscape features, will resulting in a net deterioration in landscape character of the site, the streetscene and the adjacent Eastcote Park Estate Conservation Area, contrary to Sections 15 and 16 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2023, Policy G7 of the London Plan 2021, Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan (Part 1) 2012 and Policy DMHB 14 of the Hillingdon Local Plan (Part 2) 2020.",
    "The proposed development, fails to demonstrate that the development would deliver at least a 10% increase in biodiversity value relative to the pre-development biodiversity value of the onsite habitat. The development fails to deliver a biodiversity net gain within the borough and fails to secure the protection and effective management of the remaining habitat on site, contrary to Policy EM7 of the Hillingdon Local Plan (Part 1) 2012, Policies DMEI 7 and DMHB 14 of the Hillingdon Local Plan (Part 2) 2020, Policy G6 of the London Plan 2021 and Schedule 7A of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 and the Environment Act 2021.",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2021). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020."
