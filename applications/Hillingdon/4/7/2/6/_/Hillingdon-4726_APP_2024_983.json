    "The proposed development by virtue of the scale, massing, design and material finish of the large pergola results in less than substantial harm to the setting and views of the listed building. The application is not supported by a suitably detailed Heritage Statement which clearly outlines the impact of the proposals on the setting of the designated building. The proposal therefore has failed to provide concise justification or demonstrate clear public benefits that could outweigh the less than substantial harm to the listed building. As such, the proposal is contrary to Section 66 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990, Section 16 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2023, Policies D3, D8 and HC1 of the London Plan 2021, Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan (Part One) 2012 and Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHB 1, DMHB 2, DMHB 4 and DME 5 of the Hillingdon Local Plan (Part Two) 2020.",
    "There is insufficient information submitted in support of the proposed car parking arrangements such that the level of car parking may not be appropriate for the intended use, contrary to Section 9 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2023, Policy T6.1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies DMT 2, DMT 6 and DMEI 14 of the Hillingdon Local Plan 2020.",
    "In the absence of an Arboricultural Impact Assessment and Tree Protection measures to satisfactory secure the protection of",
    "retained trees, and the wholesale and unjustified removal of a large number of mature and Category B trees, the proposal will result in a net deterioration in landscape character of the site, the streetscene and the adjacent Eastcote Park Estate Conservation Area, contrary to Sections 15 and 16 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2023, Policy G7 of the London Plan 2021, Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan (Part 1) 2012 and Policy DMHB 14 of the Hillingdon Local Plan (Part 2) 2020.",
    "In the absence of a satisfactory noise and odour assessment and mitigation, the proposed development, fails to demonstrate that the any noise and odour associated with the proposed use of the external areas for outdoor dining and the collective capacity of the outdoor spaces would not have a detrimental impact on the amenity of surrounding residential properties.  As such, the proposal is contrary to Policy DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan (Part 2) 2020, Policy D13 of the London Plan 2021 and Paragraphs 135f) of the National Planning Policy Framework 2023.",
    "In the absence of plans showing step free access for wheelchair users and others with a mobility impairment, the proposed development, fails to demonstrate that the development would achieve the highest standards of accessible and inclusive design.  As such, the proposal is contrary to Policy D5 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "In the absence of sufficient ecology information, it has not been demonstrated that the proposal would not have an adverse impact upon protected species and nature conservation and that the development would deliver at least a 10% increase in biodiversity value relative to the pre-development biodiversity value of the onsite habitat. The development fails to deliver a biodiversity net gain within the borough and fails to secure the protection and effective management of the remaining habitat on site.  As such, the proposal is contrary to Policy EM7 of the Hillingdon Local Plan (Part 1) 2012, Policies DMEI 7 and DMHB 14 of the Hillingdon Local Plan (Part Two) 2020, Policy G6 of the London Plan 2021 and Schedule 7A of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 and the Environment Act 2021.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service. We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal.",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2021). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020."
