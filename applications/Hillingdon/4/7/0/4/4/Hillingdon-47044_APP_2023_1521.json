    "Due to its uncharacteristically narrow design, the proposed dwelling would form a visually unsympathetic addition to the neighbouring semi detached dwelling. Due to its location (on the end of a pair of semi detached dwellings) the new dwelling would also disrupt and unbalance the visual symmetry which exists between the existing pair of properties. The new 2m high front boundary fencing and position of the dwelling would also lead to a significant loss of openness around the site. The proposed development would therefore be detrimental to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the streetscene and wider area, disrupting the established pattern of built form in the area. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMH 6, DMHB 5, DMHB 11, DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), as well as policies D3 and D6 of the London Plan and par",
    "The proposed development would provide a poor standard of external amenity space for the existing dwelling that is dominated by the proposed dwelling, harming the amenities of the occupants of the existing dwelling by providing them with substandard external living accommodation. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy DMHB 18 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), and paragraph 130 (f) of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The proposed dwelling would fail to meet the requirements for a M4(2) accessible and adaptable dwelling as set out in Approved Document M to the Building Regulations (2015 edition). The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy D7 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan (2021) and NPPF (2021).",
    "This is a reminder that Under the terms of the Planning Act 2008 (as amended) and Community Infrastructure Levy Regulations 2010 (as amended), should an application for appeal be allowed, the proposed development would be deemed as 'chargeable development' and therefore liable to pay the London Borough of Hillingdon Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and the Mayor of London's Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This would be calculated in accordance with the London Borough of Hillingdon CIL Charging Schedule 2014 and the Mayor of London's CIL Charging Schedule 2012.",
    "For more information on CIL matters please visit the planning portal page at: www.planningportal.gov.uk/planning/applications/howtoapply/whattosubmit/cil",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service. We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
