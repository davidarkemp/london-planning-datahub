    "The proposed roof extension by reason of its scale, siting, and poor design, would result in an excessive and disproportionate form of development that would obscure the original roof form and dominate the roof of the building. As such, the development would not be a subordinate form of development and would have a detrimental impact on the character and appearance of the host property and on the visual amenity of the surrounding residential area. The development would, therefore, be contrary to Policies D3 and D6 of the London Plan (2021), Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012), and Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
