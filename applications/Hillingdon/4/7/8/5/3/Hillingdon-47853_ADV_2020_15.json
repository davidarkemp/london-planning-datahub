    "REASON",
    "In order to protect the visual amenity of the area and/or highway safety in accordance with Policy DMHB 13A of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The decision to GRANT Advertisement Consent has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",

    "Given the nature of the proposed development it is possible that a crane may be required during its construction. Heathrow Aerodrome Safeguarding therefore draw the applicant's attention to the requirement within the British Standard Code of Practice for the safe use of Cranes, for crane operators to consult the aerodrome before erecting a crane in close proximity to an aerodrome. This is explained further in Advice Note 4, 'Cranes and Other Construction Issues' (available at http://www.aoa.org.uk/policy-campaigns/operations-safety/)",
    "The development is close to the aerodrome and the approach to the runway. The applicant is advised that there is a need to carefully design any lighting proposals. This is further explained in Advice Note 2, 'Lighting near Aerodromes' (available at www.aoa.org.uk/publications/safeguarding.asp). Please note that the Air Navigation Order 2005, Article 135 grants the Civil Aviation Authority power to serve notice to extinguish or screen lighting which may endanger aircraft."
