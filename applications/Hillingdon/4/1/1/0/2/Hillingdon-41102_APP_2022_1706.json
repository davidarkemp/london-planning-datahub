    "Due to its massing, depth, bulk, scale and design, the resulting building would form an oversized, uncharacteristic and visually incongruous form of development which would fail to harmonise with the established character of the area and appearance of the street scene and locality. The proposal would therefore be detrimental to the visual amenities of the streetscene and the character and appearance of the surrounding area, all contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012), Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policies D1 and D3 of the London Plan (2021) and paragraphs 130 (a) and (c) of the NPPF (2021).",
    "The first and second floor external terraces of the proposed building would lead to a harmful loss of privacy and overlooking to the rear garden of Ellerslie, adversely impacting on the amenities of its occupiers. Additionally the first floor kitchen window of Flat 5 would look directly into the first floor kitchen window of 233 Long Lane, adversely impacting on the amenities of its occupiers through a loss of privacy. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policy DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020) and paragraph 130 (f) of the NPPF (2021).",
    "Due to its provision of external amenity spaces with no privacy (for flats 5 and 6), flats with habitable rooms that have no or poor levels of privacy (flats 1,2,3,4 and 5), flats with bedroom spaces that have no windows and therefore minimal access to natural light and outlook (flats 1 and 4), the proposal would result in a substandard form of accommodation for its future occupiers to the detriment of their amenities. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policy DMHB 18 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020) and paragraph 130 (f) of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The proposal includes no provision of family sized residential units (3 bedrooms or more) and would result in the loss of 2x family sized residential units. The proposal therefore consists of a unsuitable housing mix which would also unacceptably undermine the supply of family housing within the Borough, contrary to Policies DMH 1, DMH 2 and DMH 4 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy H10 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "Due to the proposed number of units and density, the creation of 8 flats would result in a significant increase in people movements, vehicle movements, activity and noise generated from the site (particularly when the 4 x gardens and 4x terraces are used) causing noise and general disturbance to the occupiers of 233 and 237 Long Lone, adversely impacting on their amenities. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policy DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020) and paragraph 130 (f) of the NPPF (2021).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan (2021) and national guidance.",
    "This is a reminder that Under the terms of the Planning Act 2008 (as amended) and Community Infrastructure Levy Regulations 2010 (as amended), should an application for appeal be allowed, the proposed development would be deemed as 'chargeable development' and therefore liable to pay the London Borough of Hillingdon Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and the Mayor of London's Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This would be calculated in accordance with the London Borough of Hillingdon CIL Charging Schedule 2014 and the Mayor of London's CIL Charging Schedule 2012.",
