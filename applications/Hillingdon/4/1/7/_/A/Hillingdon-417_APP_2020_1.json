    "The application fails to provide a transport assessment and travel plan to justify the intensification of the use of the site without the provision of additional parking. Furthermore the development fails to incorporate a safe provision for pick up and drop off facility.  The lack of on-site pickup and drop off facilities would be detrimental to child safety and fails to have regard to existing highway and pedestrian safety concerns. The proposed use would result in an increase in parking stress on the local highway network and surrounding area which is already subject to considerable pressure and would create an environment that would present considerable hazard to pedestrians and will be disruptive to residents of neighbouring dwellings. The proposal would therefore fail to comply with policies 6.10, 6.13, 7.4 and 7.5 of the London Plan (2016) and Policies DMT 2 and DMT 6 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The application fails to provide an adequate noise assessment in order for the council to fully assess the noise impacts which would be apparent from the intensification of the use of the site and also the outbuildings location close to the residential properties within Victoria Avenue. The proposed use of the outbuilding would thus give rise to noise impacts which would be detrimental to the amenities of 6 and 10 Victoria Avenue and is therefore contrary to policy EM8 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policy DMHB 11 and DMHD 2 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies",
    "In the absence of a Tree Survey and Arboricultural Implication Assessment to BS5837:2012 standards, the application has failed to demonstrate that the development will safeguard existing trees on the site and further fails to demonstrate protection for and long-term retention of the trees. The proposal is therefore detrimental to the visual amenity of the street scene and the wider area contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policy DMHB 14 and DMHD 2 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies.",
    "The proposed location of the outbuilding would obstruct the right of way access to the rear garden and garage of 10 Victoria Avenue.  As such the proposal is considered to be contrary to DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 - Development Management Policies (Jan 2020).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan - The Spatial Development Strategy for London consolidated with alterations since 2011 (2016) and national guidance."
