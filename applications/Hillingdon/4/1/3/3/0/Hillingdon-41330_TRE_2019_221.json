    "The two beech trees are situated within the rear garden of 1 Tanworth Close and are highly visible from Thirlmere Gardens giving them a collective high amenity value. They make a significant contribution to the visual amenity and arboreal character of the local area.",
    "Approval was given in 2018 to reduce both trees by 2 metres as a result they have relatively small compact crowns which are suitable for a garden of this size. The applicant has stated potential danger to the house and the road as a reason for the work, however no technical evidence has been provided to support this claim. The report attached to the application mentions specialist advice should be obtained in relation to the trees but none has been provided.",
    "Having regard to the reasons given for the proposed work, the work is unjustified and will have a detrimental impact on the visual amenity and arboreal character of the area.",
    "The removal of deadwood, dangerous / hanging branches and ivy:  This does not require the formal consent of the Council."
