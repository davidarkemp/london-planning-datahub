The Oak appears to be in good health and thinning by as much as 30% as well as reducing one side would likely lead to \"lion-tailing and created a lopsided crown. It would also unnecessarily introduce multiple wounds into its crown, which would likely cause stress and lead to infection, affecting its long-term health; this would affect the safe useful life expectancy of the tree.",
