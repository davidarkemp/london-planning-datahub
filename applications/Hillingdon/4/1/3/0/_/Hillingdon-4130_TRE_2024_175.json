    "The oak tree is situated within the rear garden of 42 Copse Wood Way. The upper crown of the tree can be viewed from Copse Wood Way by passing vehicle and foot traffic, and appears to be in a good condition. Whilst the tree is not on full public display, it still makes a contribution to the arboreal character of the area.",
    "No valid arboricultural reason has been provided, and a side reduction of 2.5m for this tree is considered too severe. Whilst we are not entirely opposed to some work being carried out on some of the lower and secondary overhanging branches, we oppose a 2-3m reduction to the side of the whole crown. A resubmission should include clear photos with descriptions of individual branches for removal (example - reduce x1 branch approx. 150mm diameter at 3.5m on east side back to appropriate growth point, remove x1 branch approx. 120mm diameter at 5.5m on north side back to branch collar etc.).",
    "We do not accept that falling acorns can 'pose a significant hazard to expensive",
    "The removal of deadwood, dangerous / hanging branches and ivy:  This does not require the formal consent of the Council.",
    "Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981:  Note that it is an offence under this act to disturb roosting bats, nesting birds or any other protected species.  Therefore, if applicable, it is advisable to consult your tree surgeon / consultant to agree an acceptable time for carrying out the approved works.",
    "Owner(s)'s permission:  Permission should be sought from the owner(s) of the tree(s) and / or the owner(s) of the land that the tree(s) overhang prior to any approved work being carried out.",
    "Expected standard of tree work: The approved works must be carried out in accordance with the conditions laid out above. If they are not, then enforcement action could being taken which could lead to prosecution and heavy fines. Therefore, it is highly recommended that the works are only carried out by a professional and competent arboriculturist who undertakes to comply with the conditions of this consent and in accordance with industry best practice (BS 3998:2010). The Arboricultural Association can provide details of its approved contractors, who have demonstrated such professionalism and competence, on their website (www.trees.org.uk) or by calling 01242 522152. Or on request the Council can provide a list of contractors who are known to carry out tree work to a good standard and to normally maintain an appropriate policy of indemnity insurance."
