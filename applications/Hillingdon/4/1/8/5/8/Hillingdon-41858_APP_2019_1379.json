    "The proposed development by reason of its forward projection, overall size, scale, bulk and design, would represent an incongruous form of development which would be detrimental to the architectural composition of the existing building, would unbalance the character and appearance of the small terrace of which it forms a part and would be detrimental to the visual amenities of the street scene and the East and West Walk, Botwell Area of Special Local Character. The proposal is thus contrary to Policies BE1 and HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies BE5, BE13, BE15 and BE19 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Saved UDP Policies (November 2012) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document HDAS: Residential Extensions.",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant saved policies (referred to as policies from the Hillingdon Unitary Development Plan - Saved Policies September 2007), then London Plan Policies (2016).  On the 8th November 2012 Hillingdon's Full Council agreed the adoption of the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies. Appendix 5 of this explains which saved policies from the old Unitary Development (which was subject to a direction from Secretary of State in September 2007 agreeing that the policies were 'saved') still apply for development control decisions.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the 'Saved' UDP 2007, Local Plan Part 1, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal.",
    "The applicant should note that there are clear inaccuracies between the submitted drawings relating to the side canopy. The length appears to differ on the separate elevations with the canopy protruding beyond the original front wall on the proposed floor plan (VD025/PL03 Rev A) but set back on the proposed side elevation (VD025/PL04 Rev A)."
