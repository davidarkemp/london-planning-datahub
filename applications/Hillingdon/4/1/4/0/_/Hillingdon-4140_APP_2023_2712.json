    "The proposed development, by reason of its uncharacteristic design, siting (in a rear garden), size, scale and site coverage would be cramped and contrived, failing to result in good design or to harmonise with the existing local and historic context of the surrounding area. Th intensification of the residential use of the site would have a detrimental impact on the character and appearance of the site, streetscene and residential area as a whole. As such, the proposal would be detrimental to the visual amenity, character and appearance of the site and surrounding area, contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHB 14 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), Policies D3, D4 and D6 of the London Plan (2021), guidance within The London Plan Housing Supplementary Planning Guidance (March 2016) and the NPPF (2021).",
    "Due to its substandard size, cramped layout and the fact that it would be severely overlooked by the first floor rear windows of No.20 Dorset Avenue, the external amenity space for the new dwelling would be of poor quality to the detriment of the living conditions and amenities of its future residents.  The proposal is thus contrary to Policy DMHB 18 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies and Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "Due to its poor design, layout and inadequate provision of internal floorspace, the proposed dwelling would provide a cramped and substandard internal living accommodation for its future residents to their detriment of their amenities. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy DMHB 16 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies and Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan (2021).",
    "This is a reminder that Under the terms of the Planning Act 2008 (as amended) and Community Infrastructure Levy Regulations 2010 (as amended), should an application for appeal be allowed, the proposed development would be deemed as 'chargeable development' and therefore liable to pay the London Borough of Hillingdon Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and the Mayor of London's Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This would be calculated in accordance with the London Borough of Hillingdon CIL Charging Schedule 2014 and the Mayor of London's CIL Charging Schedule 2012.",
