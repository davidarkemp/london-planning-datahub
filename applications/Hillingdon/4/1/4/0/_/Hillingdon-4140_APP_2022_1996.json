    "The proposed development, by reason of its siting (in a rear garden), size, scale, bulk, design, layout, tree removal and site coverage would be cramped and contrived, failing to result in good design or harmonise with the existing local and historic context of the surrounding area. The principle of intensifying the residential use of the site would have a detrimental impact on the character and appearance of the site, streetscene and residential area as a whole. The proposal would be detrimental to the visual amenity, character and appearance of the site and surrounding area, contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHB 14 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), Policies D3, D4 and D6 of the London Plan (2021), guidance within The London Plan Housing Supplementary Planning Guidance (March 2016) and the NPPF (2021).",
    "The proposal would provide a substandard form of accommodation for both existing and future occuipers of No.20 and the new dwelling due to the deficient and low quality outdoor amenity spaces, all to the detriment of their residential amenity. The proposal is thus contrary to Policy DMHB 16 and DMHB18 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies and Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "The proposed dwelling incorporates design features which are incompatible with the standards required for an M4 (2) category home, as required by London Plan policy D7 which requires all new housing to provide appropriate facilities for people with disabilities.",
    "The proposed development by reason of its height, mass, scale, bulk and proximity to neighbouring rear gardens would result in a harmful sense of enclosure and overshadowing, directly contrary to Policy DMHB11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan - Part Two (2020).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal.",
    "This is a reminder that Under the terms of the Planning Act 2008 (as amended) and Community Infrastructure Levy Regulations 2010 (as amended), should an application for appeal be allowed, the proposed development would be deemed as 'chargeable development' and therefore liable to pay the London Borough of Hillingdon Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and the Mayor of London's Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This would be calculated in accordance with the London Borough of Hillingdon CIL Charging Schedule 2014 and the Mayor of London's CIL Charging Schedule 2012.",
