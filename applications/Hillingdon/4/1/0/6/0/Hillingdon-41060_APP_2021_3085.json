    "The proposed two storey rear extension, by reason of its size, design, staggered relationship and proximity, would result in an overly dominant feature that overshadows the adjacent property at No.3 Chapter Close, and as such would result in a visually intrusive and an un-neighbourly form of development, resulting in a loss of light to and outlook from this property and a material loss of residential amenity. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to policies DMHB11 and DMHD1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan - Part Two (2020).",
    "The proposed development, by virtue of its excessive scale and bulk, design and crown roofed design, and front dormer would represent disproportionate additions that would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original detached dwelling, would be detrimental to the character, appearance of the original dwelling and to the visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area. The proposal would therefore be contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), Policies D4 and D8 of the London Plan (2021) and the NPPF(2021).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service."
