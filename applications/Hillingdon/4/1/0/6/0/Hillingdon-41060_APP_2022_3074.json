    "The proposed development, by virtue of its roof design, excessive scale and bulk, in combination with the recently constructed rear box dormer, would represent disproportionate additions that would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original detached dwelling, would be detrimental to the character, appearance of the original dwelling and to the visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area. The proposal would therefore be contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), Policies D4 and D8 of the London Plan (2021) and the NPPF(2021).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
