  "description": "Erection of detached two storey, 1-bed dwelling with associated parking and amenity space provision, involving demolition of existing garages",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed development, by reason of its siting forward of the established building line of Salcombe Way, layout and site coverage would result in a visually intrusive form of development, which would fail to harmonise with the existing local and historic context of the surrounding area. As such the proposal would have a detrimental impact on the character, appearance and visual amenities of this existing open area of the street scene and the residential area as a whole. The proposal is thus detrimental to the visual amenity and character of the surrounding and contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies BE13 and BE19 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Saved UDP Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the emerging Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies with Modifications (March 2019), Policy 7.4 of the London Plan, the Council's adopted Supplementary Planning Document H",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant saved policies (referred to as policies from the Hillingdon Unitary Development Plan - Saved Policies September 2007), then London Plan Policies (2016).  On the 8th November 2012 Hillingdon's Full Council agreed the adoption of the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies. Appendix 5 of this explains which saved policies from the old Unitary Development (which was subject to a direction from Secretary of State in September 2007 agreeing that the policies were 'saved') still apply for development control decisions.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the 'Saved' UDP 2007, Local Plan Part 1, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service."
