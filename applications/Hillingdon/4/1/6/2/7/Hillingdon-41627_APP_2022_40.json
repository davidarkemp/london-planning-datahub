  "decision_conditions": [
    "Due to its scale, siting, design, and materials, the proposal would fail to harmonise with the prevailing character and appearance of the area and would negatively impact on the visual amenities of the street scene. The proposal therefore conflicts with Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012) and Policies DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the adopted Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "Due to scale of the dwelling, the large first floor windows in the northwest facing side elevation and proximity to the garden areas and neighbouring properties Nos. 21, 21A, 21B and 23 Hatherleigh Road, the proposal would harm the residential amenities of these neighbours by virtue of overlooking and loss of privacy, loss of outlook, overshadowing and overbearing; and through mutual overlooking, would provide a poor quality living accommodation for future occupiers. The proposal therefore conflicts with Policy DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020),Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "Due to its substandard internal floor area and not meeting the requirements of M4(2) technical specifications, the proposal would fail to provide an appropriate living environment for future occupiers. The proposal therefore conflicts with Policy DMHB 16 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and Policies D6 and D7 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal.",
    "This is a reminder that Under the terms of the Planning Act 2008 (as amended) and Community Infrastructure Levy Regulations 2010 (as amended), should an application for appeal be allowed, the proposed development would be deemed as 'chargeable development' and therefore liable to pay the London Borough of Hillingdon Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and the Mayor of London's Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This would be calculated in accordance with the London Borough of Hillingdon CIL Charging Schedule 2014 and the Mayor of London's CIL Charging Schedule 2012.
