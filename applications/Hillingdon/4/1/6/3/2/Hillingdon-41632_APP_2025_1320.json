    "The development hereby permitted shall be begun before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.",
    "REASON",
    "To comply with Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990.",
    "The development hereby permitted shall not be carried out except in complete accordance with the details shown on the submitted plans, numbers 7935 - SMR - 00 - ZZ - DR - A - 2200 - S4 -P3, 7935 - SMR - 00 - ZZ - DR - A - 2201 - S4 - P3, 7935 - SMR - 00 - ZZ - DR - A - 2202 - S3 - P2, 7935 - SMR - 00 - ZZ - DR - A - 2203 - S3 - P1, Flood Risk and Drainage Technical Note, Rev. P2, 01/05/25, EirEng, Outline Construction Logistics Plan, 16th June 2025, v.3, Mayer Brown, Air Quality Assessment Technical Note, 784-B070271, 1st May 2025, Tetra Tech, and shall thereafter be retained/maintained for as long as the development remains in existence.",
    "REASON",
    "To ensure the development complies with the provisions Hillingdon Local Plan Parts 1 (November 2012) and 2 (January 2020) and the London Plan (2021).",
    "For the lifetime of the development hereby permitted the rating level (LAr) of noise caused by its operation shall not exceed: 40 dB LAr 15 min for any fifteen-minute period between 2300 and 0700, and 50 dB LAr 1 hour for any one-hour period between 0700 and 2300, determined one metre free field external to any window or door of any permanent residential, or equivalently noise sensitive premises, in accordance with 'Methods for rating and assessing industrial and commercial sound' British Standards Institution BS4142 2014.'",
    "REASON",
    "To safeguard the amenity of surrounding areas in accordance with Policy DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two (2020) and Policies D3 and D13 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "It is considered that a condition based on fixed noise levels is consistent with noise and planning policy by relating external noise levels to the point at which adverse effects on health and quality of life start to be observed. The limit values are intended to be consistent with the evidence base that is reflected in guidance: 'Guidance on Sound Insulation and Noise Reduction for Buildings' BS8233 2014. This is combined with the assessment principles and procedures detailed in guidance: 'Methods for rating and assessing industrial and commercial sound' British Standards Institution BS4142 2014.' This is used to set reference time periods for the assessment and adjust measured or calculated LAeq values for character as detailed in BS4142 to determine the rating level.",
    "You are advised this development is on a former contaminated land use identified as Nursery/Orchard. Therefore, the above advice is provided on the grounds of Health and Safety of the workers on site and to ensure the appropriate restoration of the site is done should there be any contamination identified during the development where there is a need, for ground work once such works are complete to minimise risk to the occupants of the site. There is a possibility there may be some contaminating substances in the ground at the site. Our contaminated land record shows the site to be on a former contaminated land use identified as Nursery/Orchard. We would advise persons working on site to take basic precautions in relation to any contamination they may find.",
    "The decision to GRANT planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2021). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020."
