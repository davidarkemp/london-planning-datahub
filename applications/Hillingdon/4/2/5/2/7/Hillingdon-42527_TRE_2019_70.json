    "The Silver Birch can be seen from Chamberlain Way and has a moderate amenity value.",
    "This tree makes a significant contribution to the arboreal character and amenity of area.",
    "The tree does not appear to have been pruned before and has a natural form typical of this species. The tree appears to be in good health and pruning it would unnecessarily introduce multiple wounds into its crown which would likely cause stress and lead to infection, affecting its long-term health. Pruning would also result in weakly attached re-growth forming that would be prone to future failure. This would affect the safe useful life expectancy of the tree. No evidence has been provided to support the statement that the tree is causing damp within the property. The fact that the applicant has provided two options also suggests that felling is unjustifiable.",
    "Having regard to the reasons given for the proposed work, the work is unjustified and will have a detrimental impact on the visual amenity and arboreal char",
    "The removal of deadwood, dangerous / hanging branches and ivy:  This does not require the formal consent of the Council."
