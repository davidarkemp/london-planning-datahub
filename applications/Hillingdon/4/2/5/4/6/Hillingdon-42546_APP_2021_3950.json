    "The proposed development by reason of its design, siting, bulk and massing would result in a discordant and unsympathetic addition to the dwelling which would fail to read as subordinate and respect the architectural integrity of the host dwelling. The extensions would also result in the harmful loss of an important, established gap between the application property and No.51, harming the character and appearance of the site, terrace and streetscene, failing to respond to local character and context. The proposal is therefore considered contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB11, DMHB12 and DMHD1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan - Part Two (2020) and Policies D4 and D6 of the London Plan (2021).",

This addition is likely to give rise to an increase in demand for on-street parking to the detriment of highway and pedestrian safety.  The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB11; DMHB12 , DMT 6 and DMHD1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan - Part Two (2020) and Policy T6 of the London Plan (2021)",
