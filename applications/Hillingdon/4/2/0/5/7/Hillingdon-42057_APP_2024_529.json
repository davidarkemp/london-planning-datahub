    "The proposed first floor side and associated roof extensions, in combination with the previous extensions to the property, would overwhelm and subsume the original property, detracting from its architectural integrity and would result in an incongruous addition to the streetscene which would detract from  the visual amenities of the wider North Uxbridge Area of Special Local Character. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies BE1 and HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 1, DMHB 5 and DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020) and Policies D4 and D8 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "The proposal, by reason of its size, bulk, design and proximity, would result in an overly dominant form of development that overshadows the adjoining property at No.227 Park Road, and as such would result in a visually intrusive and an un-neighbourly form of development, resulting in a harmful loss of light, outlook, sense of enclosure and overall loss of residential amenity, in conflict with Policies DMHB11 and DMHD1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan - Part Two (2020).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
