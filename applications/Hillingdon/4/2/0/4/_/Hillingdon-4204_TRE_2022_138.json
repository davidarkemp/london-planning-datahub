    "The Oak is situated within the front garden of 215 Long Lane. Long Lane is a main trunk route through the borough and as a result this Oak has a Very High amenity value with the potential for a long life.",
    "There is some contradiction between the applied for work and the reasons behind the work, one of the reasons for the work is \"to reduce spread\" however a height reduction and thin will not achieve this and no lateral reduction has been applied for. No arboricultural evidence has been provided to show that this Oak is a hazard, as a result a height reduction by a much as 6m has not been justified and would leave the Oak with an unnatural topped appearance. A crown thin by as much as 30% would likely lead to lion-tailing and will leave multiple wounds throughout the Oaks canopy, which would likely cause stress and lead to infection, affecting its long-term health; this would affect the safe useful life expectancy of this Oak.",
    "Having regard to the reasons given for the proposed work,",
    "The removal of deadwood, dangerous / hanging branches and ivy:  This does not require the formal consent of the Council."
