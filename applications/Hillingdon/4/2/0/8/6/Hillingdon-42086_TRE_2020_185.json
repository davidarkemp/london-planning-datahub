  "decision_conditions": [
    "The hornbeam is situated within the rear garden of 48 Linksway. It can been seen from the highway (The Broadwalk) and as a result has a Moderate to High Amenity value. It significantly contribute to local biodiversity and Area of Special Local Character (Copsewood Estate). It contributes to the gradual transition of mature tree cover between the dwellings in the copse wood estate and the nearby Ruislip woods National Nature Reserve (NNR). The benefit in amenity and biodiversity afforded by the tree is both present and future because it has the potential for a long-life expectancy.",
    "No arboricultural reason has been provided for why the work is required. The proposed reduction and thinning would unnecessarily introduce multiple wounds into its crown, which would likely cause stress and lead to infection, affecting its long-term health; this would affect the safe useful life expectancy of the tree. Pruning would also result in weakly attached re-growth forming that would be prone to futur",
