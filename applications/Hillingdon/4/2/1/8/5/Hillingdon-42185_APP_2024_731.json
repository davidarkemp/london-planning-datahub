    "The development hereby permitted shall be begun before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.",
    "REASON",
    "To comply with Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990.",
    "The development hereby permitted shall not be carried out except in complete accordance with the details shown on the submitted Cover Letter dated 19th March 2024 and drawings numbered: P21-050-0263-01 (Rev. A) and P21-050-0263-06 (Rev. A).",
    "REASON",
    "To ensure the development complies with the provisions of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020), and the London Plan (2021).",
    "The premises shall only be used for the preparation or sale of food between the hours of 07:00 AM and 23:00 PM on Mondays to Saturdays and 08:00AM and 22:00PM on Sundays and Bank Holidays.",
    "REASON",
    "To safeguard the residential amenity of the occupiers of adjoining and nearby properties in accordance with policy D6 of the London Plan (2021), policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 Strategic Policies (2012) and policy DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "No development hereby permitted shall be used until details of secured cycle storage for two accessible cycle parking spaces (one short term and one long term) have been submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority. The facilities shall be provided in accordance with the approved details prior to the occupation of the development and thereafter permanently retained.",
    "REASON",
    "To ensure the provision and retention of facilities for cyclists to the development and hence the availability of sustainable forms of transport to the site in accordance with Policy AM9 of the Hillingdon Unitary Development Plan Saved Policies (September 2007) and Chapter 6 of the London Plan (2016).",
    "Prior to occupation, an Operation Management Plan shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority. This shall provide details of number of attendees within the development area at any one time and shall include measures to tackle anti-social behaviour around the premises. Thereafter, the development shall be operated in accordance with this plan for as long as the development remains in existence.",
    "REASON",
    "To ensure that the development does not give rise to conditions prejudicial to the free flow of traffic along the High Street, detrimental to highway and pedestrian safety, in accordance with Policies DMT 1 and DMT 2 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 (2020), Policy T4 of the London Plan (2021). Also, to ensure the proposed development does not compromise the amenity of neighbouring properties, in accordance with Policy EM8 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 (2012) and Policy DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 (2020).",
    "The decision to GRANT  planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to GRANT planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan - The Spatial Development Strategy for London consolidated with alterations since 2011 (2016) and national guidance."
