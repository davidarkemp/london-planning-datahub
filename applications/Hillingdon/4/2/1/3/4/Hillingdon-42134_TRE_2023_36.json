    "The Oak is situated within the rear garden of 8 Squirrels Close, it can be viewed from a number of different properties as well as between properties from the highway. As a result, it has a moderate amenity value.",
    "The Oak has previously been reduced although no previous application is on the system, from Google Street View the work was completed between 2008 and 2012. There is a large Ganoderma bracket situated on the trunk however no technical evidence in the way of decay detection has been provided. Without this no firm conclusions can be draw as to the level of decay within the trunk, as a result the request to remove is premature.",
    "Having regard to the reasons given for the proposed work, the work is unjustified and will have a detrimental impact on the visual amenity and arboreal character of the area.",
    "The removal of deadwood, dangerous / hanging branches and ivy:  This does not require the formal consent of the Council."
