    "Due to its size, design and proximity to No.2A Shepiston Lane, the canopy would result in increased noise, activity and disturbance from customers, including late into the evening, to the detriment of the amenities of the occupiers of the property. The proposed development is therefore considered to be contrary to Policy DMHB 11 of the London Borough of Hillingdon Local Plan - Part 2, paragraph 135 (f) of the NPPF(2023) and Policies D3 and D14 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan (2021) and NPPF (2021)."
