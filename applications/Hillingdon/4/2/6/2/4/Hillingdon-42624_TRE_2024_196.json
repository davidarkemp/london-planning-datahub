    "The two mature Oak trees are situated in the front of the property. They are in good condition and have fair form considering previous pruning. They can be seen by neighbours, road and path users giving them a high amenity value.",
    "Due to the high amenity of the trees, it is important to base decisions on tree health and arboricultural reasons. The tree has been pruned recently and cutting it this soon prevents the trees ability to gather energy through photosynthesis.",
    "This application is refused as there are a lack of arboricultural reasons. With the trees far enough from the property to be causing issues, another years growth would be beneficial to the trees."
