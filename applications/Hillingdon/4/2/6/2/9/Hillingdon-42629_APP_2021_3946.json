    "The proposed development, by reason of its siting, size, scale, bulk, design, layout, site coverage would result in a cramped development of the site, which is visually incongruous and would fail to harmonise with the existing context of the surrounding area. The principle of intensifying the residential use of the site in the form proposed would have a detrimental impact on the character and appearance of the residential area as a whole. The proposal would be detrimental to the visual amenity, character and appearance of the site and surrounding area, contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHB 14 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), Policies D3, D4 and D6 of the London Plan (2021), and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The proposed development, by reason of its siting, scale, bulk, design and proximity, would be detrimental to the amenities of the occupiers of the original dwelling at 193 Coldharbour Lane and those at No. 195 Coldharbour Lane by reason of overdominance, overshadowing, visual intrusion, loss of light and loss of outlook. Therefore, the proposal would be contrary to Policy DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate a satisfactory policy-led approach to the car and cycle parking provision and layout which could be prejudicial to all road users safety, contrary to policy DMT2 and DMT6 and the London Plan.",
    "The proposal would provide a dwelling of insufficient size and would therefore give rise to a substandard form of living accommodation to the detriment of the amenity of future occupiers. The proposal is thus contrary to Policy DMHB 16 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy D6 and Table 3.1 of the London Plan (2021), and the Technical Housing Standards - Nationally Described Space Standard (March 2015).",
    "The proposal fails to provide amenity space of sufficient size and quality commensurate to the size and layout of the proposed dwelling. As such the proposal would provide a substandard living conditions for future residents contrary to Policy DMHB11 and DMHB18 of the Hillingdon Local Plan - Part Two (2020).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal.",
    "This is a reminder that Under the terms of the Planning Act 2008 (as amended) and Community Infrastructure Levy Regulations 2010 (as amended), should an application for appeal be allowed, the proposed development would be deemed as 'chargeable development' and therefore liable to pay the London Borough of Hillingdon Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and the Mayor of London's Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This would be calculated in accordance with the London Borough of Hillingdon CIL Charging Schedule 2014 and the Mayor of London's CIL Charging Schedule 2012.",
