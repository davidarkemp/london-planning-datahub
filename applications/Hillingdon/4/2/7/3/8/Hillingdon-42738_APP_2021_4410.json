    "The side dormer roof extension, by reason of its design, scale, bulk and siting would fail to read as a subordinate addition to the roofslope, unbalance the pair of properties, appear obtrusive within the streetscene and fail to preserve or enhance the character and appearance of the West Drayton Conservation Area.  Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policies BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 4, DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), Policy D4 of the London Plan (2021) and the NPPF (2021).",
    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate with the submission of rear elevation drawings that the proposed rear dormer would preserve and enhance the character and appearance of the building, street and wider conservation area and safeguard the existing living conditions of neighbouring residents, contrary to Policies BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 4, DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), Policy D4 of the London Plan (2021) and the NPPF (2021).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service."
