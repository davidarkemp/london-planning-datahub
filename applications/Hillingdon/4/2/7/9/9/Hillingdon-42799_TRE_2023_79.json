    "The Hornbeam is situated within the rear garden of 38 Park Avenue, it is highly prominent from Sherwood Avenue and has a high amenity value. This hornbeam alongside other mature trees nearby provides a gradual change in tree canopy cover between the properties and the nearby Ruislip Woods.",
    "Having checked previous applications this hornbeam has been crown thinned and cut back from the property, but it has not been fully reduced in the past, as a result the applicant has no previous reduction points to reduce back to and the reason of Cyclical Maintenance is not appropriate. The proposed crown reduction by up to 4m is excessive and would likely be detrimental to its health, and would be detrimental to visual amenity of the locality.",
    "Having regard to the reasons given for the proposed work, the work is unjustified and will have a detrimental impact on the visual amenity and arboreal character of the area.",
    "The removal of deadwood, dangerous / hanging branches and ivy:  This does not require the formal consent of the Council."
