    "By reason of its size, location, design and surroundings, in particular its proximity to the existing pedestrian crossing, the proposed vehicle crossover raises significant concerns regarding pedestrian and cyclist safety. The proximity of the dropped kerb to the pedestrian crossing introduces an increase in vehicle movements which increase the risk of conflicts between pedestrians, cyclists, and vehicles. The design fails to meet the safety requirements necessary to protect road users, pedestrians and cyclists resulting in significant highway concerns. The proposed development is therefore considered to be contrary to Policy DMT 1 and DMT 2 of Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2, Development Management Policies (2020) and London Plan (2021) Policies T1, T2 and T4 .",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan (2021) and national guidance."
