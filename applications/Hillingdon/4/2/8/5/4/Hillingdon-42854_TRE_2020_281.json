  "decision_conditions": [
    "This mature Coastal Redwood (T55 on TPO 7) has a moderate amenity value and is a prominent landscape feature - being visible from all sides and from a good distance away. It is a very important component in the landscape and is also unique for this local area both for its size and its historic value being over 100 years old. It makes a significant contribution to the visual amenity and arboreal character of the local area. It also has a good wildlife value.",
    "This tree is approximately 22m tall, has a crown spread of approximately 5m. It is situated to the north of the property in the rear garden and is approximately 3m away from the property.",
    "The applicant has resubmitted the same application as before, this was originally refused under 42854/TRE/2020/195  for the following reasons which remain unchanged: The reasons given for removal of this tree are not considered to be justified. It is alleged that damage has been caused to the property, however, no photographic evidence",
    "The removal of deadwood, dangerous / hanging branches and ivy:  This does not require the formal consent of the Council."
