    "The existing extension, by reason of its size, scale and bulk, fails to harmonise with the architectural composition of the existing outbuilding and would be detrimental to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the Gatehill Farm Estate Northwood Area of Special Local Character. As such, the existing development fails to accord with Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies BE5, BE13, BE15 and BE19 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Saved UDP Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 5, DMHB 6, DMHB 11 and DMHD 2 of the emerging Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies with Modifications (March 2019).",
    "The existing extension, by reason of its size and siting, is detrimental to the amenities of the adjoining occupier at 15 Woodgate Crescent by reason of overdominance, visual intrusion and loss of outlook, contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies BE19, BE20 and BE21 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Saved UDP Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHD 2 and DMHB 11 of the emerging Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies with Modifications (March 2019).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Unitary Development Plan Saved Policies (September 2007) as incorporated into the Hillingdon Local Plan (2012) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan - The Spatial Development Strategy for London consolidated with alterations since 2011 (2016) and national guidance.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the 'Saved' UDP 2007, Local Plan Part 1, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service. We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
