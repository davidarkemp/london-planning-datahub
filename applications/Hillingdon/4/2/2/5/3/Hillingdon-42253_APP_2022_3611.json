    "The proposed development is capable of independent occupation from the main dwelling. As a result, the proposal would be tantamount to a separate self-contained residential unit  which is undersized and poorly designed, in a position where such a dwelling would be unacceptable, due to requirements for parking and amenity space and the impact on adjoining properties. The proposal therefore conflicts with Policies DMHD 2, DMHB 11, DMHB 16 and  DMHB 18, DMT 2 and DMT 6 of the  Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and Policies D6 and T6 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "The proposed development by reason of its size, siting and height would be oversized, incongruous and visually dominant, harming the character and appearance of the site, wider area and streetscene of Colham Road to the rear. The proposal therefore conflicts with Policies DMHD 2 and DMHB 11 of the  Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021)."
