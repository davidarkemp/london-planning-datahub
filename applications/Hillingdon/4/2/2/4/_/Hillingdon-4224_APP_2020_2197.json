    "In the absence of a Flood Risk Assessment in accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework and National Planning Practice Guidance, the application has failed to address the issues relating to flood risk and has failed to provide adequate solutions to mitigate the flood risk caused by the additional footprint created by the proposed works. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy EM6 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (Nov 2012), Policy DMEI 9 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policies 5.12 and 5.13 of The London Plan (2016), the National Planning Policy Framework (March 2012) and the Planning Practice Guidance (March 2014).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
