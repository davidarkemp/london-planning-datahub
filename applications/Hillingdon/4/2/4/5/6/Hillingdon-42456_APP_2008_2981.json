  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposal by reason of its siting and overall size and bulk in relation to the existing property and those in Cullera Close would have an adverse impact in terms of visual amenity and would thus be out of character with the existing property, the street scene and the Northwood (Eastbury Road) Conservation Area, contrary to policies BE5, BE13, BE15, BE19 and BE38 of the Hillingdon Unitary Development Plan 'Saved Policies' September 2007 and the Supplementary Planning Document HDAS: Residential Extensions.",
    "The proposal by reason of its overall size and bulk and siting in proximity to the boundary with the adjoining residential properties would give rise to an overdominant and visually intrusive form of development which would detract from the amenities of adjoining occupiers. The proposal is therefore contrary to policy BE21 of the Hillingdon Unitary Development Plan Saved Policies September 2007 and the Supplementary Planning Document HDAS: Residential Extensions.",
    "The proposed first floor lounge window in the rear elevation which faces towards 8 Cullera Close would give rise to a loss of privacy to the occupiers of this property and the proposed corridor window in the first floor front elevation which faces directly towards the private garden area of 23 Frithwood Avenue would give rise to a greater perception of being overlooked to the detriment of neighbouring residential amenity. The proposal is therefore contrary to policy BE24 of the Hillingdon Unitary Development Plan Saved Policies September 2007 and the Supplementary Planning Document HDAS: Residential Extensions.",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
