    "The proposed development, by reason of its siting, size, scale, bulk, design and cramped layout would result in an overdevelopment of the site which would be detrimental to the character, appearance and visual amenity of the surrounding Hayes Village Conservation Area and would fail to either preserve or enhance, the character or appearance of the surrounding Hayes Village Conservation Area. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies BE1 and HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies BE4, BE13 and BE19 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Saved UDP Policies (November 2012), policies DMHB 1, DMHB 4 and DMHB 11 of the emerging Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies with Modifications (March 2019), Policies 7.4 and 7.8 of the London Plan (2016), the adopted Supplementary Planning Document HDAS: Residential Layouts and the NPPF.",
    "The proposed development, by virtue of its failure to provide amenity space of sufficient size and quality commensurate to the size and layout of the existing and proposed units would result in an over-development of the site detrimental to the residential amenity of existing and future occupiers. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies BE19 and BE23 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Unitary Development Plan Saved Policies (November 2012), Policy DMHB 11 and DMHB 18 of the emerging Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies with Modifications (March 2019) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document HDAS: Residential Layouts.",
    "The proposed development fails to provide sufficient off street parking provision which meets the council's approved parking standards to service the proposed and existing dwellings and therefore the development is considered to result in substandard car parking provision, leading to on-street parking/queuing to the detriment of public and highway safety and contrary to Policies AM7 and AM14 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Unitary Development Plan Saved Policies (November 2012),  to Hillingdon's Adopted Parking Standards as set out in the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Unitary Development Plan Saved Policies (November 2012), Policy DMT6 of the emerging Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies with Modifications (March 2019) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document HDAS: Residential Extensions.",
    "The proposal would provide a habitable room (living room) with poor levels of  outlook and natural/sunlight given its proximity to the boundary fence and would therefore give rise to a substandard form of living accommodation to the detriment of the amenity of future occupiers and reliance upon artificial means of lighting which would fail to satisfy sustainability and energy efficiency objectives. The proposal is thus contrary to Policies BE19, BE20 and BE21 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Saved UDP Policies (November 2012), Policy 3.5 and 5.3 of the London Plan (2016), the Mayor of London's adopted Supplementary Planning Guidance - Housing (March 2016), Policy DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies With Modifications (March 2019) and the the Council's adopted Supplementary Planning Document HDAS: Residential Layouts.",
    "The applicant has failed to submit a desk top appraisal to determine the nature and significance of the archaeological resource along with the extent of past impacts from existing and previous developments. The proposal therefore fails to describe the significance of heritage assets in conflict with the NPPF, Policy 7.8 of the London Plan (2016), policy HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policy DMHB 7  of the emerging Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies with Modifications (March 2019).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Unitary Development Plan Saved Policies (September 2007) as incorporated into the Hillingdon Local Plan (2012) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan - The Spatial Development Strategy for London consolidated with alterations since 2011 (2016) and national guidance.",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant saved policies (referred to as policies from the Hillingdon Unitary Development Plan - Saved Policies September 2007), then London Plan Policies (2016).  On the 8th November 2012 Hillingdon's Full Council agreed the adoption of the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies. Appendix 5 of this explains which saved policies from the old Unitary Development (which was subject to a direction from Secretary of State in September 2007 agreeing that the policies were 'saved') still apply for development control decisions.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the 'Saved' UDP 2007, Local Plan Part 1, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
