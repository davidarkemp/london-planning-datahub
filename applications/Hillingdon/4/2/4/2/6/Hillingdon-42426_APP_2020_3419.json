  "description": "3 x Single storey outbuilding to rear for use as a Garden store/cinema/games room/play room for 40 + 42 Vine Lane and a games/play room/garden store for 2 Cedars Drive",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed outbuildings which would adjoin one another to form one large structure would by virtue of their size, scale and excessive footprint result in an incongruous form of development that would fail to appear subordinate and proportionate to the domestic nature and scale of the existing and proposed properties on site. The development would have the appearance of a separate residential unit which would cause harm to the prevailing character and appearance of the area. As such the proposals would be contrary to Policies DMHB 11, DMHD 1 and DMHD 2 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan - The Spatial Development Strategy for London consolidated with alterations since 2011 (2016) and national guidance.",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2016). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020."
