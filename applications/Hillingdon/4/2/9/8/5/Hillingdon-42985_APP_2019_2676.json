  "description": "Erection of a three storey, detached building to create 3 x 2-bed and 2 x 1-bed residential units with associated landscaping, cycle and refuse storage.",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed development, by reason of its siting in this open prominent position, size, scale, bulk and projection forward of the very strong building line along North Hyde Road, would result in the total loss of an important gap characteristic to the area and would thus result in a cramped, unduly intrusive, visually prominent over-development of the site. The proposal would therefore be detrimental to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the street scene and the wider area in general. Therefore the proposal is contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies BE13 and BE19 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Saved UDP Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the emerging Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies with Modifications (March 2019), Policies 3.5, 7.1 and 7.4 of the London Plan (2016) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document HDAS: Residential Layout",
    "The proposed development, by virtue of its size, scale, bulk, depth, height and proximity, would be detrimental to the amenities of the adjoining occupier at 5 Albert Road  by reason of overdominance, overshadowing, visual intrusion, loss of light and loss of outlook. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to policies BE19, BE20 and BE21 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Saved UDP Policies (November 2012), Policy DMHB 11 of the emerging Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies with Modifications (March 2019) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document HDAS: Residential Layouts.",
    "The proposed development, by virtue of its failure to provide access to amenity space of a sufficient size and quality commensurate to the size and layout of the said units would result in an over-development of the site detrimental to the residential amenity of existing and future occupiers. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies BE19 and BE23 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Unitary Development Plan Saved Policies (November 2012), Policy DMHB 18 of the emerging Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies with Modifications (March 2019) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document HDAS: Residential Layouts.",
    "The proposal does not make adequate provision for car parking in accordance with the Council's adopted standards. This is likely to result in on-street parking displacement to the detriment of highway and pedestrian safety. The proposal is therefore contrary to the Council's adopted policies in particular Policy AM14 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Saved UDP Policies (November 2012) and Emerging Policy DMT 6 of the Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (October 2015).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Unitary Development Plan Saved Policies (September 2007) as incorporated into the Hillingdon Local Plan (2012) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan - The Spatial Development Strategy for London consolidated with alterations since 2011 (2016) and national guidance.",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant saved policies (referred to as policies from the Hillingdon Unitary Development Plan - Saved Policies September 2007), then London Plan Policies (2016).  On the 8th November 2012 Hillingdon's Full Council agreed the adoption of the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies. Appendix 5 of this explains which saved policies from the old Unitary Development (which was subject to a direction from Secretary of State in September 2007 agreeing that the policies were 'saved') still apply for development control decisions.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the 'Saved' UDP 2007, Local Plan Part 1, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service. We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal.",
    "The site did have three trees which contributed towards reducing air pollutants. A green wall is proposed. This is important to help address the tree loss, given the sites location in an AQMA. But no details provided on its specification and long term maintenance. Had the application been acceptable then conditions would have been imposed requiring a detailed specification and maintenance strategy to ensure its effectiveness in reducing air pollutants."
