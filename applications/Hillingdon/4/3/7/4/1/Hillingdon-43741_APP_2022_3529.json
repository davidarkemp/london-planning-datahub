    "The proposed rear dormers, by reason of the siting, height, depth, stepped design, bulk and massing would result in a top heavy, boxy, dominant, visually intrusive, discordant and incongruous form of development that would fail to read as subordinate and successfully with the architectural composition of the original semi-detached dwelling, negatively impact the relationship of the terrace of which if forms a part and character of the wider road. Therefore, the proposal would be contrary to Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021), Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012) and Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The proposed rear dormers, by reason of the siting, height, width and depth, bulk and massing would result in substantial harm to the occupiers of no.81B Otterfield Road  in terms of dominance, loss of outlook, visual intrusion, overbearing impact, sense of enclosure and loss of daylight/sunlight. Therefore, the proposal would be contrary to Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021), Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012) and Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",

We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
