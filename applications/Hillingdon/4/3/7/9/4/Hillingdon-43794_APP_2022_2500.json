    "The proposed change of use would result in the removal of all wheelchair accessible parking spaces for existing residents of Axis House and has the potential to attract additional vehicle movements to the site and lead to a significant amount of displacement on-street parking, as existing residents who use the car park would be forced to seek alternative spaces nearby, which in turn could exacerbate the very high levels of vehicle congestion in the area. Additionally, the proposed land use would be directly associated with the operation of Heathrow Airport and therefore is an inappropriate land use by definition outside of the Heathrow Airport boundary. As such, the proposal would be contrary to Policies T1, T2, T4, T6 and T6.1 of the London Plan (2021) and Policies DMT 1, DMT 2, DMT 6 and DMAV 2 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The proposed change of use would lead to a significant loss of amenity for the existing residents of Axis House through an increase in vehicle movements which are not associated with the residential use of the site and an associated increase in noise, disturbance and air pollution alongside a loss of privacy, and an increase in the opportunities for crime and anti-social behaviour. On this basis, the proposal would be contrary to Policies D5, D6, D11, D14 and SI 1 of the London Plan (2021), Policies BE1 and EM8 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Strategic Policies (2012), Policy DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Development Management Policies (2020) and the intentions of the Mayor's Housing SPG (2016) and Secured by Design guidance (2015 and 2019) in providing a safe and secure environment.",
    "Neither an Air Quality Assessment or Transport Statement has been submitted to support the change of use and the site falls within an Air Quality Management Area and an Air Quality Focus Area, where there are known air quality issues. As such, the proposal has failed to demonstrate that it complies with Policy SI 1 of the London Plan (2021) and Policy DMEI 14 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "Under Article 14 of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015 (as amended), an applicant is required to declare whether they are the sole owner of all of the land to which the application relates, and sign the relevant certificate and serve notice accordingly. As part of the application, Certificate B has been signed, and it is stated that the applicant has served the required notice on two owners (or agricultural tenants) of the land to which this application relates.",
    "The number of comments received from landlords who own and lease out properties within Axis House indicates that the ownership of all of the land within the application site has not been correctly identified as there appear to be more than two landlords, and other comments indicate that some residents have purchased and own their flats.",
