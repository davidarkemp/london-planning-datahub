    "Due to its design, size, height above the ground, siting and illumination, the proposed free standing advertisement would form a unduly prominent, oversized and visually cluttering addition to the area which would harm the character and appearance of the streetscene and surrounding area. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012), Policies DMHB 11, 12, 13A, 15 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policies D3 and D8 of The London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "Due to its excessive width, height, illuminated design and prominent location (on the corner of the Bath Road and  Bolton's Lane), the proposed signage would form an unduly prominent, oversized and visually intrusive addition to the area, which would distract road users near to a pedestrian crossing and important signage, creating a more hazardous environment for all.  Taking into consideration the above, the proposal is considered to create a hazardous environment for pedestrians and road users and to be of detriment to public safety, contrary to Policy DMT 2 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020) and Policy T4 of the London Plan (2021), as well as paragraph 111 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan (2021) and National Guidance."
