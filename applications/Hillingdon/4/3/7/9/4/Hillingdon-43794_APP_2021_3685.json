    "The proposed development, as a result of its siting would lead to the partial loss of residential parking secured for the occupants of Axis House. This in turn would lead to a significant amount of displaced parking from the Axis House site onto the local highway on-street parking bays which would increase the pressure for on-street parking bays, exacerbate injudicious and unsafe highways conditions, and restrict the free flow of traffic. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policies T2, T4, T6, and T6.1 of the London Plan (2021) and Policies DMT1, DMT2 and DMT6 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The applicant has failed to secure the necessary legal obligations associated with the proposed development and provide contributions towards the improvement of services and facilities as a consequence of demands created by the proposed development (in respect of Air Quality, Carbon Offsetting, Travel Planning, Employment Strategy and Construction Training, Public Realm Improvements, Hospitality Training, Highways Works, and Project Management and Monitoring). The scheme therefore conflicts with Policy DF1 of the London Plan (2021), Policy DMCI 7 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Development Management Policies (2020) and the Planning Obligations Supplementary Planning Document (2014).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan (2021) and national guidance.",
    "This is a reminder that Under the terms of the Planning Act 2008 (as amended) and Community Infrastructure Levy Regulations 2010 (as amended), should an application for appeal be allowed, the proposed development would be deemed as 'chargeable development' and therefore liable to pay the London Borough of Hillingdon Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and the Mayor of London's Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This would be calculated in accordance with the London Borough of Hillingdon CIL Charging Schedule 2014 and the Mayor of London's CIL Charging Schedule 2019.",
