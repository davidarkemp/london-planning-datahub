  "description": "Single storey side extension, rear infill extension and first floor rear extension",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed extension by reason of its size, scale, bulk and width would fail to appear as a subordinate addition and would thus, fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original dwelling. Also given the proximity to the side boundary, in this open prominent position, it would result in the closing of an important gap characteristic to the area, resulting in a cramped appearance. The proposal would therefore represent an overdevelopment of the site to the detriment of the visual amenities of the street scene and the character and appearance of the surrounding area. The proposed development is therefore contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies.",
    "The proposed first floor rear extension, by reason of its size, scale, bulk and design, including the resultant roof form, would represent a visually unsympathetic form of development that would detract from the character, appearance and architectural composition of the original dwelling and the visual amenity of the surrounding area. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service."
