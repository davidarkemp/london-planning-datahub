  "description": "To remove One Oak, T28 on TPO 5",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The Oak is situated within the rear garden of 5 Neela Close. It is a prominent tree and can be seem from a number of rear gardens as well as the public highway in Neela Close, Milton Road and Pepys Close. As a result it has a Moderate to High amenity value and it significantly contributes to the arboreal character of Ickenham Village Conservation Area.",
    "The reason for tree removal has been given as the tree is infected with Ganoderma and a photo of the fungal bracket provided. However, no internal investigations have been carried out to determine the distribution or amount of decay within the tree. We have received four consultation responses all supporting the application however currently removal has not been justified and the proposed removal seems premature.",
    "Conclusion: Having regard to the reasons given for the proposed work, the work is unjustified and will have a detrimental impact on the visual amenity and arboreal character of the area.",
    "The removal of deadwood, dangerous / hanging branches and ivy:  This does not require the formal consent of the Council.",
    "Expert assessment: There are fungal brackets (fruiting bodies) at the base of the tree and in its canopy. Expert assessment should be made to determine if there is decay present, and if so how extensive it is in terms of the condition, safety and management of the tree."
