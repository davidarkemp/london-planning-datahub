    "In the absence of a Tree Survey and Arboricultural report to BS5837:2012, the applicant has failed to demonstrate that the protected tree will be unaffected by the development and has not made provision for its long-term protection. The proposal is therefore contrary to the requirements of Policy DMHB14 of the Hillingdon Local Plan - Part Two (2020).",
    "The proposed development has failed to demonstrate that it would provide an adequate level of outlook to the main living spaces in the lounge and dining room due to their reliance solely on either windows which are set at high level or a window in close proximity to the boundary fence and flank elevation of adjacent number 9 Hilliers Avenue. The proposal would therefore give rise to a substandard form of living accommodation to the detriment of the amenities of future occupiers contrary to Policy DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies and Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service."
