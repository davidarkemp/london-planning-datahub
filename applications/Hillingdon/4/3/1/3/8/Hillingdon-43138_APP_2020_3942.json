On or before that date, the building and use hereby permitted shall discontinued and the land restored to its former condition. The site shall be left in a safe condition that does not cause danger, nuisance or hazard to the public or impair visual amenity",
    "REASON",
    "The Local Planning Authority wishes to retain control over the site use in the interest of protecting the Stonefield Way Industrial and Business Area (a designated Preferred Industrial Location), the appearance of the area, neighbouring residential amenity and highway safety, in accordance with Policies DME 1, DMHB 11,  DMHB 12, DMT 1, DMT 2 and DMT 6 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "Notwithstanding the provisions of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended), the proposed development hereby approved shall be used only for ancillary storage purposes in connection to the main premises at Wickes DIY Store, Victoria Road, Ruislip HA4 0QB. Any other use shall require a separate specific planning permission.",
    "REASON",
    "The Local Planning Authority wishes to retain control over the site use in the interest of protecting the Stonefield Way Industrial and Business Area (a designated Preferred Industrial Location), the appearance of the area, neighbouring residential amenity and highway safety, in accordance with Policies DME 1, DMHB 11,  DMHB 12, DMT 1, DMT 2 and DMT 6 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The development hereby permitted shall not be carried out except in complete accordance with the details shown on Drawing Nos. SBD/20/2224/P4, SBD/20/2224/P5 Rev. I and SBD/20/2224/P6 Rev. I and shall thereafter be retained/maintained for as long as the development remains in existence.",
    "REASON",
    "To ensure the development complies with the provisions Hillingdon Local Plan Parts 1 (November 2012) and 2 (January 2020) and the London Plan (2016).",
    "The decision to GRANT  planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to GRANT planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan - The Spatial Development Strategy for London consolidated with alterations since 2011 (2016) and national guidance.",
    "The Equality Act 2010 seeks to protect people accessing goods, facilities and services from discrimination on the basis of a 'protected characteristic', which includes those with a disability. As part of the Act, service providers are obliged to improve access to and within the structure of their building, particularly in situations where reasonable adjustment can be incorporated with relative ease. The Act states that service providers should think ahead to take steps to address barriers that impede disabled people."
