  "description": "Conversion of bungalow to a two storey dwelling including the erection of an additional storey, new gable end roof and a part single, part double storey rear and single storey side extension, following the demolition of the existing garage",

    "The proposed development by reason of its size, scale, bulk, massing and poor overall design would result in an incongruous and visually intrusive form of development that could not be considered to constitute subordinate additions to the existing dwellinghouse and would fail to respect the architectural composition of the existing dwellinghouse. The proposed development would also fail to harmonise with the established built environment on Halford Road resulting in a detrimental impact on the visual amenity of the street scene and character and appearance of the area. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012), Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two- Development Management Policies (2020), Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021) and Chapter 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023).",
    "Due to its depth and siting, the proposed development would be an unneighbourly form of development and would have an overbearing impact on the adjoining residents leading to a harmful sense of enclosure and loss of outlook. Furthermore, in the absence of a BRE daylight and sunlight assessment the application has failed to demonstrate that the proposed development would not lead to a loss of light or significant overshadowing to Number 77 Halford Road. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012), Policy DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2023).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
