    "The development hereby permitted shall not be carried out except in complete accordance with the details shown on submitted plan No.3249/G210, Rev B.",

    "To ensure the development complies with the provisions of the Hillingdon Local Plan Parts 1 (November 2012) and 2 (January 2020) and the London Plan (2021).",
    "The materials to be used in the construction of the external surfaces of the development hereby permitted shall be as shown on the hereby approved plan 3249/G210, Rev B and shall thereafter be retained as such.",
    "REASON",
    "To safeguard the visual amenities of the area and to ensure that the proposed development does not have an adverse effect upon the appearance of the existing building in accordance with Policy DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 (2020)",
    "The shopfront hereby approved shall ensure that level access for wheelchair users is achieved via suitably wide door of no less than 1000 mm wide, with all such provisions retained in perpetuity.",
    "REASON: to ensure that suitable accessibility is achieved and maintained for older and disabled persons in accordance with London Plan policy D5.",
    "The decision to GRANT advertisement consent has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to GRANT advertisement consent has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan (2021) and national guidance.",
    "The Equality Act 2010 seeks to protect people accessing goods, facilities and services from discrimination on the basis of a 'protected characteristic', which includes those with a disability. As part of the Act, service providers are obliged to improve access to and within the structure of their building, particularly in situations where reasonable adjustment can be incorporated with relative ease. The Act states that service providers should think ahead to take steps to address barriers that impede disabled people."
