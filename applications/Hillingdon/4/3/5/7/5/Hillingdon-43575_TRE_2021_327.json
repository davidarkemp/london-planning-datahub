    "The Scots Pine is situated in the front garden of 93 Wiltshire Lane, opposite the entrance and parking area of Haydon School. This tree has a very high amenity value and is a significant and important landscape feature for those living within Wiltshire Lane and Everett Close, as well as for the pupils of Haydon School, who are able to gain view of this tree from different corners of the school. The tree highly contributes to the local biodiversity and makes a significantly positive contribution to the appearance of the local landscape, in unison with the other two protected Scots Pines located nearby. The benefit in amenity and biodiversity afforded by the tree is both present and future because it has the potential for long life expectancy.",
