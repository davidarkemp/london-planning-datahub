    "The proposed development, by reason of its poor internal layout would result in a substandard residential conversion to the detriment of future occupiers. The development is therefore considered to be contrary to the requirements of Policy DMH 4 and DMHB 16 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020) and Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "The proposed development fails to provide 100sqm of private external amenity space for future occupiers of the existing dwelling, with the proposed new flat being unlikely to provide 25sqm of private external amenity space given the addition of a required cycle store. Future residents would therefore be provided with substandard external accommodation to the detriment of their amenities. The development is therefore considered to be contrary to the requirements of Policy DMHB 18 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate that adequate and functional parking space could be provided for occupiers of the new flat and existing dwelling. The absence of a functional parking layout could lead to 1 (or more) vehicles being parked at the roadside. Roadside parking would hinder vehicle movements in the area leading to traffic build up to the detriment of the highways network. It would also create a more hazardous environment for pedestrians and vehicle users, as cars at the site may have to reverse onto the road, due to insufficient or poor manoeuvring space. The proposed development is therefore considered to be detrimental to pedestrian and highway safety, as well as the free movement of vehicles on the local highways network. The proposed development is therefore considered to be contrary to Policies DMT 2 and DMT 6 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), as well as policy T6.1 of the London Plan and paragraph 112 (c) and",
