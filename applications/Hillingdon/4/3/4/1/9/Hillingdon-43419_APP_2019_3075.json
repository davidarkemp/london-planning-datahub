    "The existing air conditioning units, by reason of their overall size, scale, bulk, and siting would fail to appear as a harmonious addition to the original dwellinghouse and would result in an incongruous form of development to the detriment of the street scene, character of the area and Conservation Area. The development is therefore contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies, Policies BE4, BE13, BE15 and BE19 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Saved UDP Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 4 and DMHB 11 of the emerging Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies with Modifications (March 2019) and the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF).",
    "The existing side-facing window at first floor level would overlook the property and amenity space of no.13 King Edwards Road. This form of development fails to protect the privacy of the immediately adjoining neighbour and therefore fails to accord with Policy BE24 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Saved UDP Policies (November 2012) and Policy DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies with Modifications (March 2019).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Unitary Development Plan Saved Policies (September 2007) as incorporated into the Hillingdon Local Plan (2012) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan - The Spatial Development Strategy for London consolidated with alterations since 2011 (2016) and national guidance.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the 'Saved' UDP 2007, Local Plan Part 1, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service. We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
