  "decision_conditions": [
    "The development would lead to the unacceptable subdivision and loss of a small single family dwelling for which there is an established need in the Borough. The development would therefore be contrary to policy DMH 4 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "The proposed part two storey, part single storey rear extension, by reason of its size, design and proximity, would result in an overly dominant feature that overshadows the adjoining properties at Nos. 17 and 21 Rectory Road, and as such would result in a visually intrusive and an un-neighbourly form of development, resulting in a loss of light and material loss of residential amenity in conflict with Policies DMH4; DMHB11 and DMHD1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan (2020).",
    "The proposed extensions by reason of the excessive scale, bulk and flat roofed design would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original dwelling, would be detrimental to the character, appearance and symmetry of the small terrace of houses of which it forms a part and to the visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB11, DMHB12 and DMHD1 of the Hillingdon Local plan - Part Two (2020) and Policy D4 of the London plan (2021).",
    "The proposal would provide an indoor living area of an unsatisfactory size and quality for the future occupiers of the first floor flat and would therefore give rise to a substandard form of living accommodation to the detriment of the amenity of future occupiers. The proposal is thus contrary to Policy DMHB 16 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy D6 and Table 3.1 of the London Plan (2021), the Mayor of London's adopted Supplementary Planning Guidance - Housing (March 2016) and the Technical Housing Standards - Nationally Described Space Standard (March 2015).",
    "The proposal fails to provide amenity space of sufficient size and quality commensurate to the size and layout of the said units. As such the proposal would provide a substandard form of accommodation for future residents contrary to Policy DMH4 and DMHB18 of the Hillingdon Local Plan - Part Two (2020).",
    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate a satisfactory policy-led approach to the car and cycle parking provision and layout which could be prejudicial to all road users safety, contrary to policy DMT2 of the Hillingdon Local Plan (2020), Policy DMT6 and the London Plan and the NPPF.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
