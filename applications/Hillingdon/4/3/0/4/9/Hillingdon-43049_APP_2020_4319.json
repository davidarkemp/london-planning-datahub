  "description": "Part two storey, part single storey front/side/rear extension including porch involving demolition of existing detached garage",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed two storey side extension, by virtue of its siting, size, scale, bulk, width and design, including the lack of a set back from the front at all levels, would fail to appear as a subordinate addition and would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original semi-detached dwelling, would be detrimental to the character, appearance and symmetry of the pair of semi-detached houses of which it forms a part and to the visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
