    "The proposed dwelling, by virtue of its forward siting, excessive scale, bulk, mass and height, and top heavy crown roof profile, would result in an unduly prominent and visually incongruous form of development that would be detrimental to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the existing street scene on Parkfield Road and the surrounding area. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policy BE 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One- Strategic Policies (2012), Policies DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2- Development Management Policies (2020), Policies D1, D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The proposed development, by virtue of its proximity, excessive depth, scale, bulk and height, would cause an unacceptable loss of outlook, loss of light, sense of enclosure and overbearing impact. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policy BE 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One- Strategic Policies (2012), Policy DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2- Development Management Policies (2020) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan - The Spatial Development Strategy for London consolidated with alterations since 2011 (2016) and national guidance.",
    "This is a reminder that Under the terms of the Planning Act 2008 (as amended) and Community Infrastructure Levy Regulations 2010 (as amended), should an application for appeal be allowed, the proposed development would be deemed as 'chargeable development' and therefore liable to pay the London Borough of Hillingdon Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and the Mayor of London's Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This would be calculated in accordance with the London Borough of Hillingdon CIL Charging Schedule 2014 and the Mayor of London's CIL Charging Schedule 2012.",
