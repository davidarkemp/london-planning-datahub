    "Due to its siting, width, height and wrap around window feature, the proposed extension would result in the majority of the properties front  elevation being obscured. The extension would therefore form a dominant and oversized addition to the property, which would detract from its original architectural composition; subsequently harming its appearance. Furthermore, the extension would break the visual symmetry which currently exists with the neighbouring dwelling, and would also result in a dwelling which is out of character with other similarly designed dwellings in the area. The development would therefore be harmful to the visual amenities of the street scene. For these reasons the proposal is contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2021), Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management (2020), Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021) and Chapter 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021)."
