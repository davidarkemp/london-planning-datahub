    "The proposal, by virtue of the removal of condition 4 (Tree protection) of planning permission ref. 43202/APP/2022/2906 dated 25-11-2022 (Erection of a detached dwelling with habitable roof space involving demolition of existing detached dwelling), has failed to demonstrate that the development will safeguard existing trees adjacent to the boundaries of the site and further fails to demonstrate protection for long-term retention of the trees. which are considered of merit to the Hillingdon Court ASLC.  The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies DMHB 14 and DMHB5  of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021)."
