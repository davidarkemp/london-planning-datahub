  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposal is for a detached outbuilding which, by reason of its size, scale, layout, provision of facilities within and independent access, is considered capable of independent occupation from the main dwelling and is thus tantamount to a separate dwelling in a position where such a dwelling would not be acceptable to the Council as it could result in an unacceptable, adverse impact on adjoining occupiers and additional requirements for parking and amenity space. The proposal is therefore contrary to policies DMHB 11, DMHB 18, DMHD 2 and DMT 6 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and Policies D3, D6 and T6 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service."
