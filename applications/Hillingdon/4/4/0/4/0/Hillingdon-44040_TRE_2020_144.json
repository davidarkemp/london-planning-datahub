    "Refused  - To carry out tree surgery including, crown lift to 1.5m, One Lawson Cypress within Group 5 on TPO 124",
    "The mature Lawson Cypress is a conspicuous tree situated in the front garden of 80 Knoll Crescent. The tree has a narrow, conical crown typical of this species. The tree can be seen from this section of Knoll Crescent and also the junction of Knoll Crescent and The Drive. These two roads are characterised by ornamental trees and mature conifers, which form a large percentage of tree cover. The tree has a moderate amenity value and is valued by local residents.",
    "With regard to the proposed crown lifting to 1.5m, the Cypress tree currently has branches all the way to the ground, this gives the tree a conical crown typical of this species. The removal of the lower branches would ruin the aesthetics of the crown and as it has not been carried out before the reasons submitted by the applicant \"as part of continued maintenance\" is not specific enough.",
    "Conclusion: Having regard to the reasons given for the proposed crown lifting to 1.5m, the works are unnecessary, unjustified and will have a d",
    "Approved - To carry out tree surgery including, a reduction in height by 1.5m and trim sides back to previous, One Lawson Cypress within Group 5 on TPO 124",
    "The tree to be pruned shall be reduced in height by a maximum of 1.5m (back to previous)",
    "Crown reduction shall not be construed as 'lopping' or 'topping' and shall result in a tree of typical form for the species and of balanced appearance. The works shall be carried out in accordance with the recommendations contained in BS 3998:2010 'Tree work - Recommendations'. Climbing irons or 'spikes' shall not be used during the execution of the work.",
    "REASON",
    "In order to protect health of the tree and the visual amenity of the area.",
    "Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981:  Note that it is an offence under this act to disturb roosting bats, nesting birds or any other protected species.  Therefore, if applicable, it is advisable to consult your tree surgeon / consultant to agree an acceptable time for carrying out the approved works.",
    "Expected standard of tree work: The approved works must be carried out in accordance with the conditions laid out above. If they are not, then enforcement action could being taken which could lead to prosecution and heavy fines. Therefore, it is highly recommended that the works are only carried out by a professional and competent arboriculturist who undertakes to comply with the conditions of this consent and in accordance with industry best practice (BS 3998:2010). The Arboricultural Association can provide details of its approved contractors, who have demonstrated such professionalism and competence, on their website (www.trees.org.uk) or by calling 01242 522152. Or on request the Council can provide a list of contractors who are known to carry out tree work to a good standard and to normally maintain an appropriate policy of indemnity insurance."
