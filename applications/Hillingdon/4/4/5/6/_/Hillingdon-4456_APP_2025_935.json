    "The proposed extensions by reason of their overall size, height, bulk, and design, in conjunction with loft extension, would fail to appear subordinate to the original property and pair of semi-detached dwellings of which it forms part,  giving rise to a cramped, incongruous form of development, which would be detrimental to the visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area generally. The proposal is, therefore, contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012) and Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12, and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020); and Policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021).",
