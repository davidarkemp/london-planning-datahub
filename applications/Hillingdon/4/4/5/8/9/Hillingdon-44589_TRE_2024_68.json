    "The mature Oak tree is in the rear garden and can be seen from the road by any users. It is of good form and has a medium to high amenity value. As a tree it is high amenity due to its age, species and form. But it can only be seen by a few neighbours and the users of the road.",
    "Due to the moderate to high amenity value of this tree, there needs to be no doubt that the tree is causing the subsidence. Unfortunately the report states that in their experience the Oak is probably to blame, they have not provided any evidence to say that it is. They have also said that removing it comes with a risk of heave and they will be doing site investigation. These have not been provided.",
    "The application is refused due to a lack of evidence that the tree is the cause of the subsidence. There is also 5 years left on the root barrier guarantee (letter not provided)."
