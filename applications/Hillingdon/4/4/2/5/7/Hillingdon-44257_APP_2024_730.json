    "The resultant development, by reason of the cumulative size, scale, bulk, and massing of the existing and proposed extensions, together with the partial filling of an important gap at the first-floor level between properties, would result in a visually dominant and incongruous form of development that fails to harmonise with the architectural composition of the host dwelling to the detriment of the character, appearance and visual amenities of the surrounding area. The proposed development, therefore, conflicts with Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One Strategic Policies (2012), Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12  and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policies D3 and D4 of The London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
