  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed extension, by reason of its size, scale, bulk, design and siting in a visually prominent position, fails to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original dwelling and would thus fail to preserve or enhance the significance, character or appearance of this Grade II Listed Building and would be harmful to the historic fabric, plan form and immediate setting of the Grade II Listed Building, contrary to Policies BE1 and HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 (2012), Policies DMHB 1, DMHB 2, DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy HC1 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2019).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2016). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service. We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
