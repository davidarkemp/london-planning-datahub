  "description": "Two storey rear extension (Listed Building Consent)",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed two-storey rear extension, by reason of its size, scale, bulk, design and siting in a visually prominent position, fails to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original dwelling and would thus fail to preserve or enhance the significance, character or appearance of this Grade II Listed Building and would be harmful to the historic fabric, plan form and immediate setting of the Grade II Listed Building, contrary to Policies BE1 and HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies BE8, BE10, BE13, BE15 and BE19 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Saved UDP Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 1, DMHB 2, DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the emerging Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies With Modifications (March 2019), Policy 7.8 of the London Plan (2016), the adopted Supplementary Planning Document HDAS: Residential Extensions and the NPPF.",
    "The applicant is advised that there are a number of unauthorised works to the building. A large number were identified during the previous planning and Listed Building Consent applications for the two-storey side extension (refs: 44185/APP/2016/2969 and 44185/APP/2016/2543), where it had been arranged that the applicant would raise a separate application for the retrospective Listed Building Consent, for these unauthorised works (ref: Heritage Statement p.6).",
    "Other unauthorised works have happened since and in clear breach of the conditions set in the planning and Listed Building Consent. The most notable is that the side extension has been built already, without first complying with the conditions laid down in the Planning and Listed Building Consent and the whole property has been repainted with what appears may be an inappropriate modern bright yellow paint."
