  "description": "Single storey lean to extension to form a boot room and an extension to the utility area (Application for Listed Building Consent)",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed extension, by reason of its size, scale, bulk, design and siting in a visually prominent position, fails to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original dwelling and would thus fail to preserve or enhance the significance, character or appearance of this Grade II Listed Building and would be harmful to the historic fabric, plan form and immediate setting of the Grade II Listed Building, contrary to Policies BE1 and HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 (2012), Policies DMHB 1, DMHB 2, DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy HC1 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2019).",
    "The decision to REFUSE Listed Building Consent has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE Listed Building Consent has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan (2021) and national guidance.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service. We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
