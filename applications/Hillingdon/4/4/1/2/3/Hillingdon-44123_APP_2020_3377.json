  "description": "Single storey side/rear extension and conversion of garage to habitable use, creation of first floor involving raising of roof and alterations to elevations",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed development, by virtue of its size, scale, projection, bulk, and proximity, including the introduction of a first floor rear balcony, would have an unacceptable harmful impact on the living conditions and private amenity spaces of the neighbouring occupiers at numbers 30 and 34 Deane Avenue, in terms of loss of daylight/sunlight, loss outlook, overlooking, sense of enclosure and overbearing effect. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020) and the National Planning Policy Framework (February 2019).",
    "The proposed development, by reason of its cumulative size, scale, bulk, height and design, including the raising of the roof height of the property, the introduction of a flat/pitched roof profile, the rear gable face roof dormer projections, first floor rear balcony and front porch, would appear as a disproportionate,  incongruous and uncharacteristic form of development that would  be detrimental to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the the street scene and the surrounding area.  The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020) and the National Planning Policy Framework (February 2019).",
    "The proposed development by reason of its size, scale, bulk, height, depth, width and proximity to the side boundary, with particularly regard to the proposed two storey side extension, would result in the erosion of an important visual gap that is characteristic to the area, resulting in a cramped appearance. The proposal would therefore represent an over development of the site to the detriment of the visual amenities of the street scene and the character and appearance of the surrounding area. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020) and the National Planning Policy Framework (February 2019).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2016). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020."
