  "description": "Erection of a detached garage with habitable roofspace for use as a self-contained flat.",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed detached structure, by reason of its size, scale, layout and independent access, is considered capable of independent occupation from the main dwelling and is thus tantamount to a separate dwelling in a position where such a dwelling would not be acceptable as it could result in an unacceptable impact on adjoining occupiers and additional requirements for parking and amenity space. The proposal is therefore contrary to policies DMHB 4, DMHB 11, DMHB 16, DMHB 18, DMHD 2 and DMT 6 of the London Borough of Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two-Development Management Policies (January 2020) the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2019)",
    "The proposal, by reason of its size, scale, bulk, height and design would result in an incongruous development which would be detrimental to the architectural composition and character of the host dwelling, the visual amenity of the street scene and the character and appearance of the wider area and the Ruislip Village Conservation Area. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policy BE1 and HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 4, DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020) Policies D4, HC1 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2019)",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan (2012)",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2021). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020."
