  "description": "Installation of a new vehicular crossover to front of dwelling together with associated landscaping changes to provide parking.",
  "site_name": "61 FARMLANDS",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed development, by reason of the laying of turf mesh over the characteristic grass verge to allow vehicles to cross over, likely loss of two trees and turf mesh to be laid over the front garden landscaping to allow for vehicle parking, would result in an uncharacteristic form of development that that would not preserve or enhance, but have a detrimental impact on the character, appearance and visual amenities of the area. The proposed development is contrary to Policy BE 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 (2012), Policies DMHD 1, DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHB 14 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 (2020), Policy G7 of the London Plan (2021) and paragraphs 136 and 139 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2024).",
    "The application submission fails to fully demonstrate that the proposal would not give rise to adverse impacts upon the highway network to the detriment of highway safety. Based on the information submitted, the proposed development is considered to have an unacceptable impact on highway safety. As such, the proposal is contrary to Policy DMT 2 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 (2020), and Policy T4 of the London Plan (2021), and is refused in accordance with paragraph 115 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2024).",
    "In the absence of sufficient biodiversity information, it has not been demonstrated that the proposal would deliver at least a 10% increase in biodiversity value relative to the pre-development biodiversity value of the onsite habitat. The development fails to deliver a biodiversity net gain within the borough and fails to secure the protection and effective management of the remaining habitat on site. As such, the proposal is contrary to Schedule 7A of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 and the Environment Act 2021, Policy G6 of the London Plan 2021, Policy EM7 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 (2012), and Policies DMEI 7 and DMHB 14 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 (2020).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan (2021) and national guidance.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service."
