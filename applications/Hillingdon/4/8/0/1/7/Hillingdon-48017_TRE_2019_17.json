    "The Oak tree is situated within the front garden and is the only front garden Oak tree within view. The tree significantly contributes to the amentiy and arboreal/ wooded character of the area and is a prominent landscape feature which helps to provide a gradual transition of mature tree cover between the dwellings in Broadwood Avenue and the nearby Ruislip woods National Nature Reserve (NNR).  The tree has a high amenity value.",
    "The accompanying tree report states that the tree has 20% deadwood within the tree, black staining and stem bleeds. 80% crown density for an Oak tree of this size and age is normal and most of the Oak trees within the area have some level of staining. Deadwood is exempt from the TPO application process. Currently the evidence provided in support of the removal is not strong enough to justify the removal of this prominent tree, this is inline with the applicant's comments on the application form \"I prefer to retain tree but will be guided if must be removed...\".",
    "The removal of deadwood, dangerous / hanging branches and ivy:  This does not require the formal consent of the Council."
