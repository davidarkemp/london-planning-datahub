    "The development proposal, by reason of its scale, height, width, depth, roof form and design, would result in an excessive, bulky, incongruous, dominant and visually intrusive form of development that would substantially harm the form, proportion and appearance of the existing dwelling and would be detrimental to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area. For these reasons, the proposal would conflict with Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One Strategic Policies (2012) and Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The development proposal would not retain adequate off-street parking within the curtilage to serve the dwelling in accordance with adopted car parking standards. For these reasons, the proposal would conflict with Policies DMHD 1 and DMT 6 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The site forms part of an area covered by Tree Preservation Area TPO 459. In the absence of a tree report and arboricultural impact assessment to BS5837:2012, it has not been demonstrated that the trees will be unaffected by the development and provision has not been made for their long term protection. For these reasons, the proposal would conflict with Policies DMHB 14 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan (2021) and national guidance.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service. We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
