    "The fence has resulted in the loss of the verdant landscaped area. It forms a particularly prominent and visually harsh form of boundary treatment which detracts from the attractive approach to Wilder Close and streetscene of Southbourne Gardens by having a significant enclosing effect. As such, the erection of a fence and the associated enclosure of this land is detrimental to the visual amenity of the surrounding area and as such, would be in conflict with Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan - Part 1 (2012), Policy DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHB 14 of the Hillingdon Local Plan - Part Two (2020) and policies D3 and D8 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate a satisfactory policy-led approach to the proposed fencing in relation to impact on vehicle and pedestrian visibility splays. Consequently, the development is prejudicial to all road users safety, contrary to the NPPF (2021), Policy DMT1  and DMT 2 of the Hillingdon Local Plan - Part Two (2020), and London Plan (2021) Policy T4.",
    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate that the fence would have an acceptable long term impact on the health of trees of special amenity value, contrary to Policy DMHB 14  of the Hillingdon Local Plan - Part Two (2020).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
