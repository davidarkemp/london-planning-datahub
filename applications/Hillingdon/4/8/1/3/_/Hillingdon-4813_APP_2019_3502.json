  "description": "Part two storey part single storey side extension and conversion garage to habitable us, single storey rear extension and single storey front extension",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed part two, part single storey extension, by reason of its siting in this visually prominent position, its projection forward of the building line along Chichester Avenue, lack of a set in at first floor from the side boundary would be an incongruous addition to the host dwelling and would fail to appear subordinate. In addition the loss of the hung tiles and proposed rendered finish to the gable ends would dramatically alter the appearance of the original dwelling and would result in the property appearing starkly different to other similar properties in the streetscene. Consequently the proposals would be detrimental to the visual amenities of the street scene and would be harmful to the character and appearance of the surrounding area and the adjacent Ruislip Village Conseratoin Area. The proposed development is therefore contrary to Policies BE1  of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies   BE4, BE13, BE15 and BE19 of the Hillin",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant saved policies (referred to as policies from the Hillingdon Unitary Development Plan - Saved Policies September 2007), then London Plan Policies (2016).  On the 8th November 2012 Hillingdon's Full Council agreed the adoption of the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies. Appendix 5 of this explains which saved policies from the old Unitary Development (which was subject to a direction from Secretary of State in September 2007 agreeing that the policies were 'saved') still apply for development control decisions.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the 'Saved' UDP 2007, Local Plan Part 1, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
