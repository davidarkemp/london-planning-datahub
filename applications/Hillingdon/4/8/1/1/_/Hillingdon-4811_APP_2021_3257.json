    "The proposed balcony and terrace including the side privacy screens/balustrade and roof, by virtue of its siting and design, would give rise to unacceptable levels of overlooking and privacy concerns to the occupiers at at No.31 The Drive. Therefore, the proposal would be contrary to Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The proposed balcony and terrace including the side privacy screens/balustrade and roof, combined with the altered fenestration by virtue of the siting, expanse of glazing and design would result in an incongruous, visually intrusive and cluttered feature that would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original dwelling. Therefore, the proposal would be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012) and Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",

Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020."
