    "The rear outrigger by reason of its depth, scale and design, would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original dwelling resulting in an over dominant form of development as the 9M depth greatly exceeds the Council's Policy on depth. Consequently the outrigger is considered to harm the character, appearance and visual amenities of the host dwelling and character associated with rear gardens within the area, contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020) and Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "The porch by reason of its design, scale and siting would appear as a visually dominant and incongruous feature upon the street scene and would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the host dwelling and surrounding area. Consequently the porch is considered to harm the character, appearance and visual amenities of the street scene, contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020) and Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "The rear extension, by reason of its depth along the shared boundary and proximity, would be detrimental to the amenities of the adjoining occupiers at No.. 33 Camden Avenue by reason of its overbearing impacts, overshadowing and loss of outlook. The proposal is therefore contrary to policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan - The Spatial Development Strategy for London consolidated with alterations since 2011 (2016) and national guidance."
