    "In the absence of a Tree Survey and Arboricultural Implication Assessment to BS5837:2012 standards, the application has failed to demonstrate that the development will safeguard existing trees on and adjoining the site and further fails to demonstrate protection for and long-term retention of the trees. The proposal is therefore detrimental to the visual amenity of the street scene and the wider area contrary to Policies BE1 and HE 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 1, DMHB 5, DMHB 6, DMHB 11 and DMHB 14 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2016). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service."
