The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies BE1 and HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 5, DMHB 6 , DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "The proposed extension by reason of its size, siting, scale, depth and proximity to the shared boundary, would be detrimental to the amenities of the adjoining occupiers at 20 The Broadwalk by causing a harmful sense of enclosure, reading as an overbearing rear addition and resulting in overdominance, particularly to principle areas amenity areas of the rear garden. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020)."
