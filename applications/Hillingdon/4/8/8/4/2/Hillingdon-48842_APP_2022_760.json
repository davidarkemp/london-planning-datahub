    "The proposed roof extensions by reason of size, scale, bulk and gable end design would fail to be subservient to the scale of the existing roof and would result in an unbalancing of the pair of semi-detached properties, failing to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original dwelling and would be detrimental to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies and Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020)."
