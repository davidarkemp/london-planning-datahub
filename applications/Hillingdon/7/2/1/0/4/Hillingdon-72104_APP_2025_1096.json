    "The proposed development, by reason of its siting, scale, massing, and poor overall design, would result in a discordant and unsympathetic form of development that fails to respect the setting, character, and architectural integrity of the existing and attached building. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012); Policies DMHB 11, and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020); Policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021); and the National Planning Policy Framework (2024).",
    "The proposal, by virtue of its bulk and proximity, would be detrimental to the amenities of the neighbouring occupiers at 9a Victoria Road by reason of loss of outlook and sense of enclosure. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012), Policy DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2024).",
    "The application fails to provide an Arboricultural Impact Assessment or Tree Survey in accordance with BS5837:2012 standards to assess the potential impact of the development on the existing tree identified for retention. In the absence of this information, the proposal has not demonstrated that the development would safeguard the long-term health and structural integrity of the tree or the site's contribution to local green infrastructure. As such, the application fails to demonstrate compliance with Policy G1 of the London Plan (2021), Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One (2012), and Policies DMHB 14 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two (2020).",
    "The proposed access arrangement to the residential development, located to the rear of the existing street frontage, is considered unacceptable due to concerns relating to the safety and security of future occupants. The access route lacks appropriate levels of natural surveillance and fails to provide a clearly defined, well-lit, and secure approach to the residential units. This creates an environment that may foster crime and antisocial behaviour, to the detriment of residential amenity and community safety. The proposal therefore fails to comply with the principles of \"Secured by Design\" and is contrary to Policy D11 of the London Plan (2021), Policy DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), and the guidance set out in the National Planning Policy Framework (2024).",
    "The proposed development is located within the LBH Air Quality Management Area, and within the Ruislip Town Centre Focus Area. No appropriate mitigation was offered by the applicant and therefore the proposed development is contrary to local and regional policies, Policy DMEI 14: Air Quality , London Borough of Hillingdon Air Quality Action Plan and the London Plan, Policy SI1.",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan (2021) and national guidance.",
    "This is a reminder that Under the terms of the Planning Act 2008 (as amended) and Community Infrastructure Levy Regulations 2010 (as amended), should an application for appeal be allowed, the proposed development would be deemed as 'chargeable development' and therefore liable to pay the London Borough of Hillingdon Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and the Mayor of London's Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This would be calculated in accordance with the London Borough of Hillingdon CIL Charging Schedule 2014 and the Mayor of London's CIL Charging Schedule 2012.",
