    "The proposed development, by reason of its scale (in particular the height of the building) and poor quality design would result in an uncharacteristic form of development that would fail to harmonise with the local character of the surrounding area.  The proposed development would have a detrimental impact on the character, appearance and visual amenities of the area contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the adopted Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policies 3.5 and 7.4 of the London Plan and the NPPF.",
    "The proposed development, due to its layout, fails to provide onsite private or communal amenity of a quantity and quality commensurate to the size of the proposals. Cumulatively, the shortfalls identified result in a poor quality of accommodation and residential amenity for the future occupiers  contrary to Policies BE1 and EM4 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One (2012), Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 16, DMHB 18, DMHB 19 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policies 3.5, 7.1 of the London Plan (2016), Policies G1 and D6 of the London Plan Intend to Publish version (2019) and Para 127 of the NPPF (2019).",
    "The proposed development by reason of the unit mix fails to provide sufficient family sized units required by the latest information on housing need. The proposed development fails to contribute towards mixed and balanced communities and a range of housing types required within the Borough contrary to Policy 3.8 of the London Plan (2016), Policy H10 of the draft London Plan (Intend to Publish version 2019), Policy DMH 2 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and the NPPF (2019).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2016). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service."
