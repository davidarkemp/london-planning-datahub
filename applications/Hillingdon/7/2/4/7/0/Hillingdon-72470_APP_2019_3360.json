    "The applicant has failed to submit satisfactory details and samples relating to materials and external surfaces and boundary treatments. The window positions and door openings have changed without planning consent and the proposal is contrary to Policy BE13 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two Saved UDP Policies (November 2012).",
    "The landscape proposal fails to correlate with the approved plans further soft landscaping would be lost and replaced with hard landscaping that is incongruous within the setting of the proposed property. The proposed boundary treatment, particularly the brick wall with metal railings in the front garden fails to enhance the streetscene. The landscaping plan fails to provide comprehensive details of bin stores and fails to provide cycle parking as such, the proposal fails to accord with Policies BE13 and BE38 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Saved UDP Policies (November 2012).",
    "The applicant has failed to submit satisfactory details relating to sustainable water management. The proposal is thus contrary to Policy OE8 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two Saved UDP Policies (November 2012) and 5.12 of the London Plan (2016).",
    "In the absence of comprehensive detailing setting out traffic management and access arrangements (vehicular and pedestrian), parking provisions for contractors during the development process (including measures to reduce the numbers of construction vehicles accessing the site during peak hours) and construction process and the storage of demolition/construction materials on site, the applicant has failed to demonstrate the proposal would safeguard the amenities of existing occupiers and would not result in a conflict with other road users contrary to Policy OE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Saved UDP Policies (November 2012).",
    "In the absence of comprehensive details justifying the increase in car parking or provide details of how car parking allocations would be managed, the applicant had failed to demonstrate that all on-site car parking shall be allocated and dedicated for the use of each of the residential units contrary to Policy AM14 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Saved UDP Policies (November 2012) and Chapter 6 of the London Plan (July 2016).",
    "The applicant has failed to satisfactorily demonstrate the applicant proposes to install appropriate security measures as part of the development to achieve secured by design accreditation and therefore the proposal is contrary to Policies 7.1 and 7.3 of the London Plan (2016).",
    "In the absence of a comprehensive validation report and soil sampling analyses, the details fail to ensure that risks from land contamination to the future users of the land and neighbouring land are adequately minimised, together with those to controlled waters, property and ecological systems contrary to Policy OE11 Hillingdon Local Plan: Part: 2 Saved UDP Policies (November 2012); Policy 7.21 of the London Plan (2016); and National Planning Policy Framework (2019).",
    "In the absence of an acoustic assessment the details submitted fail to demonstrate appropriate provisions have been made to control noise within residential units and between proposed units. The scheme fails to comply with Policy OE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two Saved UDP Policies (November 2012), Policy 7.15 of the London Plan (March 2016) and the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) (March 2012).",
