The amendments sought are the removal of the false gable and its replacement with a gable wall and roof on the south elevation, changes to window units, and changes to the roof ridge height of Block A3.",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed amendments, by reason of the increased height of the ridgeline and greater bulk of the roof, would materially alter the approved scheme and appear to add floor area to the development (although floorplans have not been provided). The changes are therefore unacceptable for an application submitted under Section 96A of the the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended)."
