    "The proposal involves a change of use from restaurant (use class E as detailed in The Town and Country Planning (Use Classes) (Amendment) (England) Regulations 2020) to tanning salon. Insufficient evidence has been submitted by the applicant to demonstrate that a tanning salon would fall within use class E of the Order. Therefore the Local Planning Authority considers that a tanning salon would fall within the sui generis use class. As such, the proposal is considered to constitute development as defined by Section 55 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended) and the proposed change of use is not one which is permitted by the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended). Furthermore, the proposal would result in the subdivision of a planning unit that would be considered to constitute development under Section 55 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended). The proposal therefore requires full planning permission."
