    "The proposed LED screens by reason of their excessive quantity, size, scale, design, prominent nature and siting, and degree of illumination would result in dominant and harmful signage which would fail to complement the visual amenity and character of the site and surrounding area, resulting in a visually cluttered appearance that would not be appropriate or suitable to the site and surroundings. The proposal would be detrimental to the character and appearance of the visual amenity of the street scene. As such, the proposal is contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11 and DMHB 13A of the  Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020)."
