Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies BE13, BE15 and BE19 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Unitary Development Plan Saved Policies (November 2012) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document HDAS: Residential Extensions.",

The proposals is thus contrary to Policies BE13 and BE38 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Saved UDP Policies (November 2012) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document HDAS: Residential Extensions.",
    "The proposed single storey front extension, by virtue of its size, scale and depth would be detrimental to the amenities of the adjoining occupier at 26 Langton Grove, by reason of overdominance, overshadowing, visual intrusion, loss of light and loss of outlook.
