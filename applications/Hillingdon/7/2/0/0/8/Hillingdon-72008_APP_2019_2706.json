  "description": "2-storey, 3-bedroom detached dwelling with associated parking and amenity space",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed sub-division of the existing residential plot and the siting, size, scale, bulk, design, layout, and site coverage of the proposed dwelling, would result in a cramped and over dominant development of the site, to the detriment of the established character, appearance, visual amenities and arboreal/wooded character of the street scene and the wider Copsewood Estate Area of Special Local Character. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies BE1 and HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies BE5, BE6, BE13 and BE19 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Saved UDP Policies (November 2012), Policy 7.4 of the London Plan (2016) and the Council's adopted Supplementary Planning Document HDAS: Residential Layouts. Emerging Policies DMEI 6, DMHB 5, DMHB 6 AND DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies with Modifications (March 2019)",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Unitary Development Plan Saved Policies (September 2007) as incorporated into the Hillingdon Local Plan (2012) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan - The Spatial Development Strategy for London consolidated with alterations since 2011 (2016) and national guidance.",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant saved policies (referred to as policies from the Hillingdon Unitary Development Plan - Saved Policies September 2007), then London Plan Policies (2016).  On the 8th November 2012 Hillingdon's Full Council agreed the adoption of the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies. Appendix 5 of this explains which saved policies from the old Unitary Development (which was subject to a direction from Secretary of State in September 2007 agreeing that the policies were 'saved') still apply for development control decisions.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. The Council's supports pre-application discussions, however none took place in this case in respect of this revised proposal.",
    "The Council has been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to statutory policies and is therefore unacceptable."
