  "description": "Hip to gable roof extension and rear dormer roof extension (including conversion of roofspace into habitable space); front porch extension (following demolition of existing addition); single storey rear outbuilding (following demolition of existing building); hard and soft landscaping and boundary treatment.",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed outbuilding, by reason of its siting, combined height, width, depth would result in a dominant, incongruous, bulky, visually intrusive and overbearing addition that would fail to appear proportionate and incidental to the main dwellinghouse. The proposed addition would negatively impact the relationship with the adjacent properties, character and apperance of the area alongside visual amenities of the streetscene. Therefore, the proposal would be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012) and Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12, DMHD 1 and DMHD 2 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The proposal would result in an unacceptable reduction in the quantum of private external amenity space associated with the application property, resulting in a substandard form of accommodation, contrary to Policies DMHD 1, DMHD 2 and DMHB 18 of the Hillingdon Local Plan - Part 2 Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2021). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020."
