    "The applicant has failed to submit satisfactory details and clarity relating to hard and soft landscaping, boundary treatment, external lighting, electric vehicle charging points, refuse and cycle stores and play equipment, in terms of specification, type and appearance. Furthermore, the site would be dominated by hard landscape, which is environmentally unsound. The proposal would result in a poor quality development that fails to preserve and enhance the visual amenities of the locality and provide adequate facilities for prospective occupiers. The proposal would therefore conflict with policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12, DMHB 14, DMEI 1 and DMT 2 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 (2020) and Policy G5 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "The proposed installation of a 'Berg In Ground Trampoline' and 'Tolymp Cross More' outdoor gym,  in such close proximity to the mutual boundary shared with 17 Highfield Crescent, could give rise to potential issues relating to loss of privacy and overlooking for these neighbouring occupiers. No clear or concise details have been provided to suggest otherwise. The proposal would therefore conflict with Policy DMHB 11 of the  Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 (2020)."
