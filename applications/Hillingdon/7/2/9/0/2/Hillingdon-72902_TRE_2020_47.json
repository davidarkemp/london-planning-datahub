    "The Oak tree can be seen from within the public grounds of Manor Farm and the public highway (Pinn Way). It has a moderate to high amenity value and significantly contributes to the arboreal characteristics of the local area and is situated within Ruislip Village Conservation Area.",
    "The Oak tree has an attractive natural crown typical of the species. Pruning would unnecessarily introduce multiple wounds into it's crown, which would likely cause stress and lead to infection, affecting it's long-term health; this would affect the safe useful life expectancy of the tree. Pruning would also result in weakly attached re-growth forming that would be prone to future failure. No Arboricultural reasons have been submitted to justify this work.",
    "Having regard to the reasons given for the proposed work, the work is unjustified and will have a detrimental impact on the visual amenity and arboreal character of the area.",
    "The removal of deadwood, dangerous / hanging branches and ivy:  This does not require the formal consent of the Council."
