    "The proposed first floor extension, by virtue of its siting, size, scale, bulk and proximity, would be detrimental to the amenities of the adjoining occupier at 48 Hillingdon Hill  by reason of overdominance, visual intrusion and loss of outlook. Therefore, the proposal would be contrary to policies BE19 and BE21 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Saved UDP Policies (November 2012) and the Council's adopted Supplementary Planning Document HDAS: Residential Extensions.",
    "The proposed first floor extension by reason of its size, scale, bulk and width, would result in an incongruous addition which would fail to appear as a subordinate addition and would thus be detrimental to the appearance of the original house and the visual amenities, character and appearance of the wider area. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies BE13, BE15 and BE19 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Saved UDP Policies (November 2012) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document HDAS: Residential Extensions.",
    "The proposed single storey side/rear extension, by virtue of its size, scale and height would be detrimental to the amenities of the adjoining occupier at 44 Hillingdon Hill, by reason of overdominance, overshadowing, visual intrusion and loss of light. Therefore, the proposal would be contrary to policies BE19, BE20 and BE21 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Saved UDP Policies (November 2012) and the Council's adopted Supplementary Planning Document HDAS: Residential Extensions.",
    "The proposed development, by virtue of the position of the side facing window, would be detrimental to the amenities of the adjoining occupier at 48 Hillingdon Hill by reason of overlooking and loss of privacy. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to policies BE19, BE21 and BE24 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Saved UDP Policies (November 2012), Policy 3.5 of the London Plan (2016) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document HDAS: Residential Extensions.",
