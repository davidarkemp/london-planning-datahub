    "The proposed development represents inappropriate development within the Green Belt in terms of the guidance contained in the National Planning Policy Framework which is harmful by definition to its open character and appearance. Furthermore, there are no very special circumstances provided or which are evident which either singularly or cumulatively justify the development which would overcome the presumption against inappropriate development in the Green Belt. The development is therefore harmful to the Green Belt, contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework, Policy G2 of the London Plan (2021), Policy EM2 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policy DMEI 4 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "The proposed development, by reason of its siting in this open, visually prominent position, size, scale, bulk, height and design, would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original building, would be detrimental to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the street scene and would fail to either preserve or enhance the character or appearance of the surrounding Hillingdon Village Conservation Area. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies BE1 and HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 1, DMHB 4, DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), Policy HC1 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2019).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
