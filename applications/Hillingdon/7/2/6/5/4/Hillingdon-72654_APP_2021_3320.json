    "Due to its bulky, oversized and uncharacteristic crown roof, coupled with the prominent two storey side extension and variety of other minor extensions and fenestration alterations, the proposed development would harm the character and appearance of the existing dwelling and would fail to respect its original architectural composition, reading as an uncharacteristic and unduly prominent addition in the Foxdell streetscene. The proposed development is therefore considered to be harmful to the appearance of host dwelling and surrounding area, all contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), as well as paragraph 130 of the NPPF (2021) and Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021).",

    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan - The Spatial Development Strategy for London consolidated with alterations since 2011 (2016) and national guidance."
