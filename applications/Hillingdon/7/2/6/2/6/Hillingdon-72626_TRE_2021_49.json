  "description": "Two Cypress to fell, A1 on TPO 130",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The two cypress trees are situated in the front garden. Collectively they have a high amenity value and significantly contribute to the Arboricultural character of the local area.",
    "In 2020 (72626/TRE/2020/173) we received an application to fell four cypress trees from the front garden due to the damage they were causing. This was supported by an Arboricultural report and was approved. The applicant wishes to remove these further two trees for the same reason however their removal was not included in the original damage report and no further report has been supplied. As a result, there is no evidence that these two remaining cypress trees are involved in causing the damage.",
    "Having regard to the reasons given for the proposed work, the work is unjustified and will have a detrimental impact on the visual amenity and arboreal character of the area.",
    "The removal of deadwood, dangerous / hanging branches and ivy:  This does not require the formal consent of the Council."
