    "The proposed dwellinghouse, by reason its size, scale, bulk and design, and its lack of separation distance between the neighbouring properties would appear as a cramped and incongruous form of development which would be detrimental to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11, DMH 6, and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "No.4 Court Drive forms part of a continuous line of properties with a rigid building line and uniform plot widths between Nos.2 & 20 Court Drive. It is considered that the proposed dwellinghouse would, by reason of the resultant narrow plot widths, result in a cramped form of development which would be harmful to the character, appearance and pattern of development along Court Drive. The proposed development would be contrary to the requirements of Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020) and Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "The proposed development, by reason of the lack of soft landscaping and planting along the frontage of the proposed development, would be detrimental to the character and appearance of the streetscene on Court Drive.  The proposal fails to provide at least 25% of soft landscaping to the front of the proposed development and therefore fails to satisfy the requirements of Policies DMH4, DMHB11, DMHB14 of the Hillingdon Local Plan : Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020)."
