    "The Oak is situated within the rear garden of 5 Fringewood Close and views of the tree can be seen from the highway between properties. The Oak as the potential for a long life and has a Moderate Amenity value.",
    "Work to crown reduce by 2m was approved in February 2021 and carried out. Although the Oak seems to have reacted well to this recent prune with dense new growth it is unlikely the Oak has fully recovered from this work. As a result, to reduce back to these points and crown thin so soon after the previous work would likely cause dysfunction affecting the Oak's safe useful life.",
    "Having regard to the reasons given for the proposed work, the work is unjustified and will have a detrimental impact on the visual amenity and arboreal character of the area.",
    "The removal of deadwood, dangerous / hanging branches and ivy:  This does not require the formal consent of the Council."
