    "The extensions by reason of its size, scale, siting and design would represent an incongruous and insubordinate addition, failing to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original dwelling and reducing the openness of the site to the detriment of the character, appearance and visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area including the adjacent Area of Special Local Character.  The proposal is therefore contrary to  Paragraphs 135b) of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023), Policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021), Policies HE1 and BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One Strategic Policies (2012) and Policies DMHB 1, DMHB 2, DMHB 5, DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
