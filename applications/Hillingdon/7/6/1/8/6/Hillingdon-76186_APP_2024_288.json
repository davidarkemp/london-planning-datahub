    "Due to the combination of its uncharacteristic design, height, cramped layout and prominent location in the street, the new dwelling would cause less than substantial harm to the conservation area and harm to the general character and appearance of the area. The less than substantial harm caused to the Conservation Area would not be outweighed by public benefits. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies, Policies DMHB 1, DMHB 4, DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policies HC1 and D3 of the London Plan (2021), as well as paragraphs 135 and 208 of the NPPF (2023).",
    "The first floor rear windows of of No.8 Cleveland Road would provide views into the garden area of the new dwelling thereby causing excessive overlooking and a significant loss of privacy to new residents to the detriment of their amenities and living conditions. The proposal is therefore considered to be contrary to Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021), and paragraph 135 (f) of the NPPF (2023).",
    "The site is not allocated with the Development Plan for residential or mixed-use development. The proposed development does not include industrial, storage or distribution floorspace as part of mixed-use site intensification. No information has been submitted to evidence that there is no reasonable prospect of the site being used for industrial and industrial related purposes set out in Part A of Policy E4 Land for industry, logistics and services. The loss of the existing industrial unit is therefore considered to be unjustified and unacceptable. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy E7 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "The occupiers of the new dwelling would be provided with undersized, cramped and overlooked external amenity space and poor levels of outlook and daylight/sunlight provision. The occupiers of the new dwelling would therefore have a poor standard of internal living accommodation and external amenity space, to the detriment of their amenities and living conditions. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policies DMHB 16 and DMHB 18 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and Policy D6 of The London Plan (2021) and paragraph 135 (f) of the NPPF (2023).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan - The Spatial Development Strategy for London consolidated with alterations since 2011 (2021) and national guidance.",
    "This is a reminder that Under the terms of the Planning Act 2008 (as amended) and Community Infrastructure Levy Regulations 2010 (as amended), should an application for appeal be allowed, the proposed development would be deemed as 'chargeable development' and therefore liable to pay the London Borough of Hillingdon Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and the Mayor of London's Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This would be calculated in accordance with the London Borough of Hillingdon CIL Charging Schedule 2014 and the Mayor of London's CIL Charging Schedule 2012.
