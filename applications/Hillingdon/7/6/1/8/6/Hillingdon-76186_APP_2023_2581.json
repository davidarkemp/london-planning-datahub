    "Due to the combination of its uncharacteristic design, height, cramped layout and prominent location in the street, the new dwelling would cause less than substantial harm to the conservation area and harm to the general character and appearance of the area. The less than substantial harm caused to the Conservation Area would not be outweighed by public benefits. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies, Policies DMHB 1, DMHB 4, DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policies HC1, D1, D3 and D6 of the London Plan (2021), as well as paragraphs 71, 124,130, 197, 199 and 202 of the NPPF (2021).",
    "The new dwelling would have first floor bedroom windows providing views toward the rear elevation windows and gardens of No's 4 and 6 Cleveland Road. Due to the position of the windows and their close proximity to the mentioned neighbouring properties, the proposed development would cause excessive overlooking and a significant loss of privacy to the detriment of those neighbours amenities and living conditions. The proposal is therefore considered to be contrary to Policies DMHB 11, of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021), and paragraph 130 (f) of the NPPF (2021).",
    "The first floor rear windows of of No's 4 and 6 Cleveland Road would provide views into the rear windows and garden of the new dwelling. Due to the position of the windows and their close proximity to the new dwelling the proposed development would cause excessive overlooking and a significant loss of privacy to new residents to the detriment of their amenities and living conditions. The proposal is therefore considered to be contrary to Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021), and paragraph 130 (f) of the NPPF (2021).",
    "The internal arrangement of the dwelling would fail to meet the requirements for a M4(2) accessible and adaptable dwelling as set out in Approved Document M to the Building Regulations (2015 edition). The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy D7 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "The site is not allocated with the Development Plan for residential or mixed-use development. The proposed development does not include industrial, storage or distribution floorspace as part of mixed-use site intensification. No information has been submitted to evidence that there is no reasonable prospect of the site being used for industrial and industrial related purposes set out in Part A of Policy E4 Land for industry, logistics and services. The loss of the existing industrial unit is therefore considered to be unjustified and unacceptable. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy E7 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "The occupiers of the new dwelling would be provided with undersized, cramped and overlooked external amenity space. The occupiers of the new dwelling would therefore have poor quality and insufficiently sized external amenity space, to the detriment of their amenities and living conditions. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policy DMHB 18 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan - The Spatial Development Strategy for London consolidated with alterations since 2011 (2016) and national guidance.",
    "This is a reminder that Under the terms of the Planning Act 2008 (as amended) and Community Infrastructure Levy Regulations 2010 (as amended), should an application for appeal be allowed, the proposed development would be deemed as 'chargeable development' and therefore liable to pay the London Borough of Hillingdon Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and the Mayor of London's Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This would be calculated in accordance with the London Borough of Hillingdon CIL Charging Schedule 2014 and the Mayor of London's CIL Charging Schedule 2012.",
