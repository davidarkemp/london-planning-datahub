    "The proposed side/rear extension by reason of its size, scale, bulk, height, depth, proximity to the side boundary along Hillside Rise, in this open prominent position, would result in a visually dominant, insubordinate and incongruous form of development that would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original dwelling, and would result in the closing of an important gap characteristic to the area, resulting in a cramped appearance. The proposal would be detrimental to the visual amenities of the street scene and to the character and appearance of the surrounding area of local special character. The proposed development is therefore contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHD 1 and DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
