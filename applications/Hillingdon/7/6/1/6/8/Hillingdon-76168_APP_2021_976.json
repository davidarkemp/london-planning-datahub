  "description": "Single storey side/rear extension, porch to front and conversion of roofspace to habitable use to include raising of the roof, 2 x rear dormers and 5 x front rooflights.",
  "lapsed_date": "21/04/2024",
  "last_date_consultation_comments": "09/04/2021",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed single storey side extension and extensions to the roof, by reason of its siting in this open prominent position, size, scale, bulk, proximity to the side boundary and projection forward of the established building line along Hillside Close, would result in the loss of an important gap characteristic to the area, resulting in a cramped appearance. The proposal would therefore represent an overdevelopment of the site to the detriment of the visual amenities of the street scene and the character and appearance of the surrounding area. The proposed development is therefore contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB5, DMHB11 and DMHD1 of the Hillingdon Local plan - Part Two (2020) and Policies D4 and D6 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "The proposed extensions, by virtue of their excessive scale, bulk and proximity would result in an unacceptable loss of light and outlook to the ground floor bedroom window of Number 83 Northwood Way,  resulting in an unacceptable loss of amenity to the occupants of this property. The poposal therefore fails to comply with the requirements of Policy DMHB11 and DMHD1 of the Hillingdon Local plan - Part Two (2020).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
