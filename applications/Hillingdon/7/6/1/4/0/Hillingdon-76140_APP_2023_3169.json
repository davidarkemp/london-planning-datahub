    "In the absence of detailed information in support of the intensification of the childminding use, it has not been demonstrated that the proposed use can be supported in principle with the building being more akin to a larger commercial child minding operation and the potential loss of a family home. The proposal is therefore considered to conflict with the NPPF (2024), Policies S1, S2, GG1 and GG3 of the London Plan (2021), Policy CI1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Strategic Policies (2012), Policies DMCI 1, DMH 1, DMHB 11, DMT 2, and DMEI 2 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The proposed development have an unacceptable and undue impact on existing residential amenity in terms of noise and disturbance and the proposal would therefore be contrary with Policy EM8 of the Hillingdon Local Plan - Part 1: Strategic Policies (2012), Policies DMH5 and DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020) and Policy D14 of the London 2021.",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan (2021) and national guidance."
