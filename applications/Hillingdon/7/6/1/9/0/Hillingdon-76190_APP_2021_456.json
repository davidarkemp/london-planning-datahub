  "description": "Porch to front, part two storey part single storey rear extension with pitched roof, 2 x rooflights and conversion of roofspace to habitable use to include a rear dormer and 1 x side rooflight and 1 x front rooflight",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed part two storey, part single storey rear extension, by reason of its excessive size, scale, bulk, and design, would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original building and fail to either preserve or enhance the character or appearance of the surrounding Ickenham Village Conservation Area. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies BE1 and HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012),  Policies DMHB 1, DMHB 4, DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), Policy HC1 of the London Plan (2021) and the NPPF.",
    "The proposed porch, by reason of its size, scale, bulk, and design, would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original building and symmetry of the pair of semi detached properties and fail to either preserve or enhance the character or appearance of the surrounding Ickenham Village Conservation Area. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies BE1 and HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012),  Policies DMHB 1, DMHB 4, DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), Policy HC1 of the London Plan (2021) and the NPPF.",

    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2016). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020.",
