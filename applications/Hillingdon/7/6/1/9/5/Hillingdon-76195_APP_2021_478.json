  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed part single storey/part two storey side extension, by virtue of its siting, size, scale, bulk and design, including the lack of a set back from the front at all levels, would fail to appear as a subordinate addition and would thus be detrimental to the appearance of the original house, the visual amenities of the street scene and the character and appearance of the wider area. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "The proposed widening of the existing vehicle access would exacerbate existing highway conditions and would result in conditions prejudicial and detrimental to the amenity of pedestrians, contrary to policies DMT 2 and DMT 6 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020)."
