    "The development hereby permitted shall be begun before the expiration of five years from the date of this permission.",
    "REASON",
    "To comply with paragraph A.3 (11) of Schedule 2, Part 16 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "The development hereby permitted shall not be carried out except in complete accordance with the details shown on the submitted plans,",
    "215 PROPOSED SITE PLAN Issue C",
    "265 PROPOSED SITE ELEVATION Issue C",
    "304 PROPOSED CONFIGURATION ANTENNA SCHEDULE Issue C",
    "307 EQUIPMENT SCHEDULES & DEPENDENCIES Issue C",
    "and shall thereafter be retained/maintained for as long as the development remains in existence.",
    "REASON",
    "To ensure the development complies with the provisions of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020) and the London Plan (2021).",
    "Any apparatus or structure provided in accordance with this approval shall be removed from the land, as soon as reasonably practicable after it is no longer required for electronic communications purposes, and such land, shall be restored to its condition before the development took place, or to any other condition as may be agreed in writing with the Local Planning Authority.",
    "REASON",
    "To ensure that the development is removed as soon as it is no longer required in order to protect the character and appearance of the area in accordance with Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHB 21 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "The decision to GRANT planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to GRANT planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan (2021) and national guidance.",
    "Given the nature of the proposed development it is possible that a crane may be required during installation. Heathrow Aerodrome Safeguarding therefore draws the applicant's attention to the requirement within the British Standard Code of Practice for the safe use of Cranes, for crane operators to consult the aerodrome before erecting a crane in close proximity to an aerodrome. This is explained further in Advice Note 4, Cranes (available at http://www.aoa.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Advice-Note-4-Cranes-2016.pdf)",
    "To demonstrate that 5G capability can be operated safely from the site, the installing/operating organisation should ensure there is compliance with the Ofcom 5G Coordination procedure for air traffic control radar",
    "(https://www.ofcom.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0030/81579/info-memorandum.pdf Annexe 8). The operating organisation should be able to demonstrate this to the satisfaction of both the airport and radar operator as well as the telecoms regulator.",
    "The applicant is reminded that this proposal is effectively revision of a previously approved scheme. The Telecommunications equipment and apparatus approved under 76175/APP/2021/364 cannot be implemented, if the apparatus approved under this application is installed."
