    "The proposed development, by reason of its siting, design, layout, and site coverage, would result in a cramped development of the site, which is visually incongruous (given the setting) and would fail to harmonise with the existing local context of the surrounding area. The intensification of the use of the site, would have a detrimental impact on the character and appearance of the residential area as a whole. The proposal would be detrimental to the visual amenity and character and appearance of the site and surrounding area and contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), Policies D3, D4 and D6 of the London Plan (2021), and the NPPF (2023).",
    "The proposed dwelling would fail to provide a satisfactory internal living environment for their future occupiers by virtue of the failure to comply with the Nationally Described Space Standards, proximity of the proposed front bedroom windows to the proposed parking/refuse area, and the lack of outlook from bedrooms. Consequently the proposal would be contrary to Policy DMHB 15 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), London Plan (2021) Policy D6 and the National Planning Policy Framework (2023).",
    "The proposal fails to provide a step free access for the new dwelling and fails to meet the internal floorspace and layout standards set out in Diagram 27 of Approved Document M to the Building Regulations. The proposal is therefore considered to be contrary to Policy D7 A(2) of the London Plan, which requires all houses (which are created via works to which Part M volume 1 of the Building Regulations applies) meet Building Regulation requirement M4(2) 'accessible and adaptable dwellings'.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "a) We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
