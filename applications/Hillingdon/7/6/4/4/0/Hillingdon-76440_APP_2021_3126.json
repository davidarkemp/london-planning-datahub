    "The proposed development by reason of the rear facing first floor windows and their proximity to the neighbouring property at Number 2 Woodhall Close, would result in a form of development which would not provide satisfactory amenities for that adjoining property, due to the loss of privacy that would arise. The proposal is therefore contrary to policies DMHB11 and DMHD1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan - Part Two (2020).",
    "The proposed part double storey, part single storey, side and rear extensions, by reason of their size, design and proximity, would result in an overly dominant feature that would overshadow and appear overbearing to the occupants of the adjacent property at No.6 Beacon Close. As such, the proposal would result in a visually intrusive and an un-neighbourly form of development, resulting in a material loss of residential amenity.  Therefore the proposal would be contrary to policies DMHB11 and DMHD1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan - Part Two (2020).",
    "The proposed part double storey, part single storey, front and rear extensions, by reason of their size, design and proximity, would result in an overly dominant feature that would overshadow and cause loss of light to the adjacent property at No.2 Beacon Close. As such, the proposal would result in a visually intrusive and an un-neighbourly form of development, resulting in an unacceptable loss of light and material loss of residential amenity.  Therefore the proposal would be contrary to policies DMHB11 and DMHD1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan - Part Two (2020).",
    "The proposed extensions as a result of their cumulative scale, bulk, massing and the design and appearance of the proposed front extension would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original dwelling and would be detrimental to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
