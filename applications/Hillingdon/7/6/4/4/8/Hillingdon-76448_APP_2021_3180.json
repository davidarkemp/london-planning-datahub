    "The proposed rear dormer roof extension, by reason of design, scale, bulk, and design, would exceed more than two thirds the average width of the original roof, would fail to retain a substantial element of the original rear roofslope and would constitute an overly-large roof extension that would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original semi-detached dwelling, would be detrimental to the character, appearance and symmetry of the pair of semi-detached houses of which it forms a part and to the visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020)."
