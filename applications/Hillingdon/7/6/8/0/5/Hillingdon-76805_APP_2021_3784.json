    "The proposed two storey rear extension, by virtue of its excessive scale and bulk and crown roofed design would represent a disproportionate addition that would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original dwelling, would be detrimental to the character, appearance of the terrace of houses of which it forms a part and to the visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area. The proposal would therefore be contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "The proposed extension would, by virtue of its failure to maintain an adequate amount of private usable external amenity space for the occupiers of the existing property, result in over-development of the site detrimental to the residential amenity of the existing occupiers. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies DMHB11; DMHB18 and DMHD1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan - Development Management Policies (2020)."
