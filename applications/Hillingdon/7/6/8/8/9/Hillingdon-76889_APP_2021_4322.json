    "The proposed telecommunications street pole and associated equipment, by virtue of their siting, size, scale, bulk and height, would represent incongruous, dominant, cluttered and visually intrusive features in the street scene that would cause significant harm to the character and appearance of the street scene and the wider area. The proposal will also have a detrimental impact upon the character and appearance of the nearby Ruislip Village Conservation Area. The development would therefore be contrary to paragraphs 115, 130 c) and 195 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies D1, D3, D8, HC1 and SI6 of the London Plan (2021), Policy BE1 and HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012) and Policies DMHB 1, DMHB 4, DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHB 21 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The Local Planning Authority considers that the applicants have failed to provide robust evidence to demonstrate that other more suitable and less harmful sites do not exist, and that they have actively explored the possibility of erecting the proposed telecommunications equipment on existing buildings, masts or other structures. The development would therefore be contrary to paragraphs 115 and 117 c) of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy SI6 of the London Plan (2021) and Policy DMHB 21 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The proposed telecommunications street pole and associated equipment, by virtue of the general siting, combined height, width and depth would be detrimental to the immediate amenities of the occupiers of nearby residential properties by reason of overdominance, visual intrusion, overbearing impact and loss of outlook. Therefore the development would be contrary to Policy DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The application fails to demonstrate that the development would not result in a risk to the safe and efficient operations of air traffic services, as the site is located within 3km of an aerodrome and the applicant has not consulted the Civil Aviation Authority/Secretary of State for Defence/Aerodrome Operator (as confirmed in the application) contrary to Part 16, Class A, A.3(3) of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended), and also contrary to Policy DMAV 1 and DMHB 21 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and NPPF Section 10 'supporting high quality communications'.",
    "The decision to REFUSE prior approval has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE prior approval has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan (2021) and national guidance.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
