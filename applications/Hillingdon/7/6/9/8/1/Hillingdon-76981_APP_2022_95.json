  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed development constitutes as inappropriate development which is, by definition, harmful to the Green Belt and would have an adverse impact on the openness of the Green Belt. In the opinion of the Local Planning Authority, there are no very special circumstances that would clearly outweigh the harm caused to the Green Belt. The proposed development is therefore contrary to Policy EM2 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One- Strategic Policies (2012), Policy DMEI 4 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy G2 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The application site lies in a rural location with very limited access to the range of services and facilities required to support the proposed residential development. As a result, future occupiers of the proposed dwelling would be highly dependent on the need to travel by means of private car. The principle of the development in this location is therefore unacceptable as the proposal would fail to provide sustainable transport choices. The proposed development is therefore contrary to Policy T1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy GG2 of the London Plan (2021) and the  National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The proposed development, by virtue of its siting, scale, width, mass, height and inclusion of a new access road and associated paraphernalia, would appear as an incongruous and highly conspicuous form of development that would be at odds with the rural setting of the site. The proposal would therefore cause unacceptable harm to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the area, contrary to  Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One Strategic Policies (2012), Policies DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the  Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policies D1, D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "In the absence of an Arboricultural Impact Assessment, Method Statement and Tree Protection Plan, it has not been demonstrated that the proposed development could be constructed without undue loss of the trees at the site which currently provide high visual amenity value. The potential harm caused to the trees would cause unacceptable harm to the character, appearance and visual amenity of the area. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One Strategic Policies (2012),  Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHB 14 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2: Development Management Policies (2020), Policy G7 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan (2021) and national guidance.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "a) We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal.",
    "This is a reminder that Under the terms of the Planning Act 2008 (as amended) and Community Infrastructure Levy Regulations 2010 (as amended), should an application for appeal be allowed, the proposed development would be deemed as 'chargeable development' and therefore liable to pay the London Borough of Hillingdon Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and the Mayor of London's Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This would be calculated in accordance with the London Borough of Hillingdon CIL Charging Schedule 2014 and the Mayor of London's CIL Charging Schedule 2012.",
