  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed roof extensions, by reason of their siting in a visually prominent position, bulk, size and shape, would result in incongruous and poorly designed development on the roofslope of the property. The proposal would therefore represent unsympathetic additions to the host property, failing to relate to the architectural composition and read as subordinate, to the detriment of the character, appearance and visual amenities of the surrounding area, harming the Long Lane streetscene. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHD 1, DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
