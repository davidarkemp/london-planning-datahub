    "The proposed two storey side/rear extension, by reason of its siting in this visually prominent position and its projection forward of the building line along Oak Avenue,  would be detrimental to the openness of this corner plot, the symmetry of the terrace of which it forms a part and the visual amenities of the street scene and would be harmful to the character and appearance of the surrounding area. The proposal therefore conflicts with the aims and requirements of Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1, Policy D4 of D8 of the London Plan (2021) and Policies DMHB11, DMHB12 and DMHD1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan - Part Two (2020).",
    "The proposed extensions would, by virtue of their failure to maintain an adequate amount of private usable external amenity space for the occupiers of the existing property, result in over-development of the site detrimental to the residential amenity of the existing occupiers. The proposal is therefore contrary to policies DMHB11, DMHB18 and DMHD1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan - Part Two (2020).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
