    "The proposed single-storey side/rear extension, by reason of its design, cumulative scale, and massing, would have a harmful impact on the character and appearance of the host dwelling, constituting an incongruous addition that would be to the detriment of the visual amenity and character of the semi-detached formation and the surrounding residential area. The proposal is, therefore, contrary to Policies D3 and  D4 of the London Plan (2021), Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan (Part 1) (2012), and Policies DMHD 1 and DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan (Part 2) (2020).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
