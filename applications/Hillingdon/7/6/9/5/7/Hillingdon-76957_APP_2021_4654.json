    "The proposed development, by reason of the size, scale, bulk and design of the rear roof extension, would fail to appear as a subordinate addition and would thus fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original dwelling, would be detrimental to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the street scene and would fail to either preserve or enhance the character or appearance of the Eastcote Park Estate Conservation Area. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies BE1 and HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 1, DMHB 4, DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020)) and the NPPF.",
    "The application fails to demonstrate that the site is safe and flood risk is suitably mitigated through the provision of an appropriate flood risk assessment. The application is therefore contrary to Policy EM6 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policy DMEI 9 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies."
