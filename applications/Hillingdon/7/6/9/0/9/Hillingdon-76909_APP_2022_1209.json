    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate that the building has been vacant for a continuous period of at least 3 months immediately prior to the date of the application for prior approval (22/04/22). The proposal therefore fails to comply with provision MA.1.(1)(a) of Class MA, Part 3, Schedule 2 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England)  Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "According to the plans submitted with the application, the bedroom within Flat 8 would have 2 bedrooms which exceed 11.5 square metres in floor area and are therefore double bedrooms. Flat 8 would therefore be a 2bedroom 4 person property, set over a single floor. The nationally described space standards issued by the Department for Communities and Local Government on 27th March 2015 advise that such properties should provide 70sqm of internal floorspace. Flat 8 would provide  61sqm failing to meet these standards. The proposal therefore fails to satisfy the requirements of provision 3 (9A) (b) of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended)."
