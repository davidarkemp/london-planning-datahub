    "The first floor side extension by reason of its size, siting, design and appearance would fail to respect the important gap between the application property and no.553, fail to read as a subordinate addition to the application property and result in a poor quality development which unbalances the semi-detached pair. As a result the development fails to respect the character and appearance of the application property, pair of properties and streetscene of Bath Road, failing to preserve or enhance the character and appearance of the conservation area, all contrary to Policies HE1 and BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHD 1, DMHB1, DMHB 4, DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "The proposed rear dormer window by reason of its excessive bulk, width, size and siting would result in an overly dominant and top heavy roof addition which fails to read as a subordinate addition to the host property, unbalancing the pair of properties as viewed from the rear and harming the original design and appearance of the host property. The proposal therefore fails to preserve or enhance the character and appearance of the conservation area and fails to comply with Policies HE1 and BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHD 1, DMHB1, DMHB 4, DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2016). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020."
