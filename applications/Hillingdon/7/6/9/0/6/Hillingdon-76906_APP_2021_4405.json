  "description": "Single storey rear extension (following demolition of existing part rear extension and removal of side boundary fence), connection of proposed rear extension onto the existing side/rear garage and conversion into a study room and increase of roof height, replacement garage doors, solar panels to rear extension roof and garage, single storey front porch extension (following removal of existing addition) including Stuco White Plaster to the front and side elevations of the dwelling including to the rear of the garage, hip to gable end extension including roof level side window, rear dormer roof extension (including conversion of roofspace into habitable use), front rooflight, removal of both chimneys, replacement side (inward facing) garage windows with one window and replacement roof tiles including to the front projecting gable",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed single storey rear extensions, by reason of their combined height, width and in particular cumulative depth, bulk and massing alongside the proposed linkage with the existing side/rear garage would result in a dominant, visually intrusive, disproportionate and excessively sized addition that would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original dwelling, would unbalance the relationship with the adjoining property of no.182 Herlywn Avenue and would be detrimental to the character and appearance of the surrounding area. Therefore, the proposal would be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012) and Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The proposed hip to gable extension alongside rear dormer, by reason of the uncharacteristic roof transition, combined height, width and depth, including siting of the rear dormer would result in a boxy, top heavy, bulky, dominant, disproportionate and visually intrusive form of development that would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original dwelling, would unbalance the relationship with the adjoining property of no.182 Herlywn Avenue, and would be detrimental to the character and appearance of the streetscene and surrounding area. Therefore, the proposal would be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012) and Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The proposed single storey rear extensions by reason of their design, scale and proximity, combined height, width and in particular depth would be detrimental to the amenities of the adjacent occupiers of no.182 and 186 Herlwyn Avenue, in terms of overdominance, overshadowing, visual intrusion, overbearing impact, loss of light and loss of outlook. Therefore, the proposal would be contrary to Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2021). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020."
