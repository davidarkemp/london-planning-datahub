  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed single storey rear extension, , by virtue of its size, scale, bulk, depth and proximity, in combination with its staggered siting with the adjoining property, would be detrimental to the amenities of the adjoining occupier at 54 Hawthorne Crescent, by reason of overdominance, overshadowing, visual intrusion, loss of light and loss of outlook. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The proposed development has failed to demonstrate that it would provide an adequate level of outlook for the future occupiers of bedroom 2 due to its reliance on a side facing window in close proximity to the side boundary. The proposal would therefore give rise to a substandard form of living accommodation to the detriment of the amenities of future occupiers contrary to Policy DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies and Policies 3.5 and 5.3 of the London Plan (2016).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan - The Spatial Development Strategy for London consolidated with alterations since 2011 (2016) and national guidance.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service."
