    "Unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority the applicant is required to implement a site wide waste strategy, which must ensure that clinical waste does not mix with other waste streams and all waste is suitably disposed of.",

    "Given the nature of the proposed development it is possible that a crane may be required during installation.  We would, therefore, draw the applicant's attention to the requirement within the British Standard Code of Practice for the safe use of Cranes, for crane operators to consult the aerodrome before erecting a crane in close proximity to an aerodrome.  This is explained further in Advice Note 4, 'Cranes' (available at http://www.aoa.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Advice-Note-4-Cranes-2016.pdf)",
