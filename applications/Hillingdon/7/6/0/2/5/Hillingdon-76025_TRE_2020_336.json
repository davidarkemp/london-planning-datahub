    "The Ash is situated at the end of the Close and is highly visible to residents of St Gregory Close and neighbouring Angus Drive. As a result, this Ash has a Moderate to High amenity value and it significantly contributes to the arboricultural character of the local area.",
    "The applicant has ticked yes to both 4.1 (condition of the tree) and 4.2 (alleged damage to property) however the tree surgeons report provided is very limited in information in relation to the condition of the tree. The company used is neither an Arboricultural Association registered contractor nor an Arboricultural Consultancy and there are no cited qualifications for the letter writer. There is evidence of disturbance to the brick paving within the parking area however no evidence has been provided to show that this or the alleged damage to the other property has been caused by the tree.",
    "Having regard to the reasons given for the proposed work, the work is unjustified and will have a detrimental impact on the visual",
    "The removal of deadwood, dangerous / hanging branches and ivy:  This does not require the formal consent of the Council."
