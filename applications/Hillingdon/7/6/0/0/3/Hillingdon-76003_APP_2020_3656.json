  "description": "Erection of a two storey 6-bed dwelling with habitable roofspace, basement and associated parking and amenity space including demolition of existing building",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed development, by reason of its siting, layout, size, scale, bulk and design, would fail to harmonise with the existing local and historic context of the surrounding area. The proposed development would therefore have a detrimental impact on the character, appearance and visual amenities of the street scene and the wider Copsewood Estate, Northwood Area of Special Local Character. This would be contrary to Policies HE1 and BE1 of the adopted Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012), Policies DMHB 1, DMHB 5, DMHB 6, DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the adopted Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policies 3.5, 7.1, 7.4 and 7.8 of the London Plan (2016) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2019).",
    "The proposed development, by virtue of its size, scale, bulk, height and proximity, would be detrimental to the amenities of the neighbouring occupier at Cobwebs, Oak Glade and their associated external amenity space, by reason of over-dominance, visual intrusion, loss of outlook and overbearing effect. The proposed development would therefore be contrary to Policy DMHB 11 of the adopted Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2019).",
    "The proposed development would lead to unacceptable harm to the verdant character, appearance and visual amenities of the area and the wider Copsewood Estate, Northwood Area of Special Local Character, due to the loss of a significant number of high quality trees, including trees protected by Tree Preservation Order number 398. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies HE1 and BE1 of the adopted Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012), Policies DMHB 1, DMHB 5, DMHB 6, DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHB 14 of the adopted Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policies  7.4 and 7.5 of the London Plan (2016) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2019).",
    "Insufficient evidence has been submitted to demonstrate that the proposed development would not have an adverse impact upon bats, which are a protected species. The proposal is therefore contrary to the Policy DMEI 7 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy 7.19 of the London Plan (2016) and paragraph 175 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2019).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2016). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020.",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan - The Spatial Development Strategy for London consolidated with alterations since 2011 (2016) and national guidance."
