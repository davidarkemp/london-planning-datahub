    "The proposed development does not constitute permitted development by virtue of the provisions of Schedule 2, Part 3, Class O of the  Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended) because it has not been demonstrated, on the balance of probability, that the application building and the land within its curtilage was used for a use within Class B1(a) (offices).",
    "The application fails to demonstrate that future occupants would be safe over the lifetime of the proposed development and that flood risk would be suitably mitigated through the provision of an appropriate flood risk assessment. The proposal would therefore conflict with Policy EM6 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1- Strategic Policies (2012), Policy DMEI 9 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy 5.12 of the London Plan (2016), the National Planning Policy Framework (2019) and Planning Practice Guidance."
