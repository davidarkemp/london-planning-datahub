    "The original dwelling and existing dwelling (which has been extended) fail to provide 120 sqm of internal floor area. The property is therefore considered to be of an inadequate size for conversion. Additionally the conversion would result in the loss of a three-bedroom dwellinghouse for which there is an established need in the Borough. The development is therefore considered to be contrary to the requirements of Policies DMH 2 and DMH 4 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "The ground floor 2 bedroom, 3 person flat fails to provide 61sqm of internal floor space for its future occupiers. The first floor 2 bedroom, 3 person flat (set over two floors) fails to provide 70sqm of internal floor space for its future occupiers. The proposed flats would therefore be of an unsatisfactory size for their future occupiers, giving rise to a substandard form of living accommodation, harming the amenities of their future occupiers. Accordingly, the new flats are considered to be contrary to the requirements of Policy D6 A of the London Plan (2021), Policy DMHB 16 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and the Technical Housing Standards - Nationally Described Space Standard (2015).",
    "By reason of its oversized outbuilding and small, irregular, unusually configured gardens, the proposed development would form a type of development which contrasts with the areas established garden layout and character of built garden development . The proposal would therefore be harmful to the areas character and is considered to be contrary to the requirements of Policies DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020) and paragraph 130 of the NPPF (2021).",
    "Due to its excessive, depth, width and overall size, the proposed outbuilding would be disproportionate to the size of the host dwelling and site. The proposal would therefore be harmful to the character and appearance of the site and dwelling, contrary to the requirements of Policies DMHD 2 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan - The Spatial Development Strategy for London consolidated with alterations since 2011 (2016) and national guidance."
