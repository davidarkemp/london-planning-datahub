  "description": "Part two storey, part single storey rear extension",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed part two storey/part single storey rear extension, by reason of its size, scale, bulk and design, including the introduction of a flat roof profile, would appear as an incongruous addition that would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original dwelling and the adjoining row of terraced properties it forms a part of, and would cause harm to the visual amenities of the surrounding area. The proposal would therefore be contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012) and Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two -",
    "Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The proposed part two storey/part single storey rear extension, by virtue of its size, scale, bulk, height and proximity, would be detrimental to the amenities of the adjoining occupier at numbers 6 and 7 Watkins Close, by reason of overdominance, visual intrusion and overdominance. The proposal would, therefore, be contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The proposed extension, by virtue of its failure to maintain an adequate amount of private usable external amenity space for the occupiers of the extended property, would result in an over-development of the site detrimental to the residential amenity of existing and future occupiers. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies DMHD 1 and DMHB 18 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2016). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020."
