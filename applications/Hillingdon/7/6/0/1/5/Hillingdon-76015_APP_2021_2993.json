    "The proposed rear dormer roof extension, by virtue of its combined height, width, depth, bulk and massing would result in a boxy, bulky, visually intrusive, disproportionate, incongruous, dominant and overbearing addition that would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original dwelling. For these reasons the dormer window would also fail to preserve or enhance the character and appearance of the Eastcote Park Estate Conservation Area. Therefore, the proposal would be contrary to Policies HC1, D1 and D4 of the London Plan (2021), Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012), Policies DMHB 4, DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2021). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020."
