    "The proposed extensions, by reason of their combined siting, design, height, scale and proportions would result in a visually incongruous and dominant dwelling that would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original dwelling, would have an adverse visual relationship with the properties along Highfield Drive, and would therefore harm the visual amenities of the street scene and character and appearance of the area. Therefore, the proposal would be contrary to Policies D1 and D4 of the London Plan (2020), Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012), Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The proposed extensions, in particular the excessive rearward projection, by virtue of its siting and scale would give rise to unacceptable loss of outlook, overbearing impact, visual intrusion and sense of enclosure to the occupiers at 21 Highfield Drive, resulting in harm to residential amenity. Therefore, the proposal would be contrary to Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2021). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020."
