    "The proposed ground and first floor rear extension, by virtue of its size, scale, bulk, depth, height and proximity, would be detrimental to the amenities of the adjoining occupier at 28 The Chantry by reason of over-dominance, overshadowing, visual intrusion, loss of light and loss of outlook. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
