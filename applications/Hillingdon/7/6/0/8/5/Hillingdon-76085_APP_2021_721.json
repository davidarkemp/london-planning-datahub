    "The proposed materials would fail to replicate the design and appearance of the existing windows, particularly to the front of the property. It is also not clear what material the windows are to be constructed of. The cumulative loss of original features within the conservation area would fail to adequately preserve its character and appearance. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies BE1 and HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 1, DMHB 4 and DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), Policy HC1 of the LOndon Plan (2021) and the NPPF."
