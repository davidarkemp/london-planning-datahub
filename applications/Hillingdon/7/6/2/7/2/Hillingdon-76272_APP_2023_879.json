    "The proposed side/rear wraparound extension, by reason of bulk, size, siting, scale, design and massing would result in a dominant, poorly designed and disproportionate development that would fail to read as subordinate to the original dwelling and respect its architectural composition. The cumulative impact, overall footprint and excessive bulk would also fail to harmonise with the established local context, removing a crucial visual gap between No. 38 and No. 36 Castle Avenue. This would result in a harmful visual impact on the character and appearance of the host dwelling and wider area. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012), Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021), Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The proposed side extension, by reason of its scale, bulk, depth along the shared boundary and proximity, would be detrimental to the amenities of the adjacent occupiers at 36 Castle Avenue by reason of its overbearing impact and overshadowing. The proposal is therefore contrary to policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan - The Spatial Development Strategy for London consolidated with alterations since 2011 (2016) and national guidance."
