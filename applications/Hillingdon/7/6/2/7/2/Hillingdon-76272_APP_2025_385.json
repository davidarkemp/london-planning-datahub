    "The roof alteration/extensions, by reason of the scale, bulk, and design of the hip to gable end roof design and rear dormer fails to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original dwelling and has resulted in detrimental harm to the character, appearance and symmetry of the small terrace of houses of which it forms a part and harmful to the visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One (2012) and Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two (2020) and Chapter 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2024).",
    "The porch, by reason of its siting, scale, width, height, massing and forward projection, has resulted in detrimental harm to the character, appearance and symmetry of the small terrace of houses of which it forms a part and to the visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area. The development therefore conflicts with Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One (2012) and Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two (2020), Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021) and Chapter 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2024).",
    "The constructed development, by virtue of the introduction of the dark grey roof tiles in replacement of the former brown roof tiles on the original host dwelling and the introduction of painted render over the buff brick exterior, has resulted in detrimental harm to the character, appearance and symmetry of the small terrace of houses of which it forms a part and to the visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area. The proposal therefore conflicts with Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One (2012), Policies DMHD1, DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two (2020), Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021) and Chapter 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2024).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2021). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020."
