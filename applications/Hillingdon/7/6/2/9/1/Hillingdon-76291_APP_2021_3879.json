    "The proposal involves a change of use into a restaurant, bar and hot food takeaway. That would not fall within the same use class as the existing retail unit (Use Class E) and instead would constitute a sui generis use. As such, the proposal is considered to constitute development as defined by Section 55 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended) and the proposed change of use is not one which is permitted by the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended). Planning permission is required for the proposed change of use."
