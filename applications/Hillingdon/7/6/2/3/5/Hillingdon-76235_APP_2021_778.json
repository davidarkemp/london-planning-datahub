  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed single storey front/side/rear extensions and first floor side/rear extension, replacement of roof with raised ridge, replacement of cladding and single storey detached garage individually and cumulatively by reason of their size, scale, bulk and design would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original dwelling, would be detrimental to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the street scene and would fail to either preserve or enhance the character or appearance of the surrounding Eastcote Village Conservation Area and the setting of the adjacent Grade ll Listed building. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies BE1 and HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 1, DMHB 4, DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), Policies HC1 and D4 of the London Plan (2021) and the NPPF.",
    "In the absence of a Tree Survey and Arboricultural Method Statement in accordance with BS5837:2012 standards, the application has failed to demonstrate that the development will safeguard existing trees on the site and further fails to demonstrate protection for and long-term retention of the trees. The proposal would, therefore, be detrimental to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the street scene and would fail to either preserve or enhance the character or appearance of the surrounding Eastcote Village Conservation Area and the setting of the adjacent Grade ll Listed building. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies BE1 and HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 1, DMHB 4, DMHB 11, DMHB 12, DMHB 14 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), Policies HC1 and D4 of the London Plan (2021) and the NPPF.",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2021). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020."
