  "description": "Single storey rear extension, porch to front and conversion of roofspace to habitable use to include a rear dormer and solar panels to front elevation",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed single storey rear extension, size, scale, bulk and depth, would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original building, would be detrimental to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the surrounding area and would fail to either preserve or enhance the character or appearance of the surrounding Hayes Village Conservation Area. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies BE1 and HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 1, DMHB 4, DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), Policy HC1 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2019).",
    "The proposed porch, by reason of its size, scale,bulk and forward projection, would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original building, would be detrimental to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the street scene and would fail to either preserve or enhance the character or appearance of the surrounding Hayes Village Conservation Area. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies BE1 and HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 1, DMHB 4, DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), Policy HC1 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2019).",
    "The proposed rear dormer extension, by reason of its size, scale, bulk, and design, would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original dwelling, would be detrimental to the character, appearance and symmetry of the terrace of houses of which it forms a part, to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the surrounding area and would fail to either preserve or enhance the character or appearance of the surrounding Hayes Village Conservation Area. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies BE1 and HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 1, DMHB 4, DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), Policy HC1 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2019).",
    "The installed solar panels, by reason of their siting along the front roof slope, unacceptably add clutter to the roof and fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original dwelling, are detrimental to the character, appearance and symmetry of the terrace of houses of which it forms a part, to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the surrounding area and fail to either preserve or enhance the character or appearance of the surrounding Hayes Village Conservation Area. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies BE1 and HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 1, DMHB 4, DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), Policy HC1 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2019).",
    "In the absence of accurate and consistent drawings of the proposed property and proposed rear elevation, it is not possible to fully assess the planning merits of this proposal in terms of its impact upon the character and appearance of the existing house and streetscene. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies BE1 and HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 1, DMHB 4, DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), Policy HC1 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2019).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2021). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. The Council's supports pre-application discussions. We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
