    "The site frontage is not of a sufficient width to safely accommodate the installation of an additional vehicle crossover at the site. The proposed crossover would be sited in proximity and adjoining the neighbouring crossover at No.144 and as no separation distance would be provided between the two crossovers, the proposed crossover would be prejudicial to highway and pedestrian safety, contrary to Policies DMT 1 and DMT 2 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), the Council's Domestic Vehicle Crossover Footway Policy (2019) and Policy T4 of The London Plan (2021) .",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2021). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
