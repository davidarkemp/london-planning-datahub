    "The roof alteration/extensions, by reason of the  size, scale, bulk, and design of the rear dormer window,  would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original detached dwelling, would be detrimental to the character, and appearance of the original property and to the visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area. Therefore, the proposal would be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
