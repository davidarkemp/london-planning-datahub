    "The proposed erection of a 1.8m high  boundary wall would harm the cottage character of the site and create an unacceptable sense of enclosure. As such, the development would fail to preserve and enhance the Springwell Lock Conservation Area, contrary to Policies DMHB  4, DMHB 11 and DMHD 1  of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "The proposed erection of a 1.8m high  boundary wall would create an unacceptable sense of enclosure with an undue loss of light and outlook to the occupants of the adjacent 1 Noakes Cottages. As such the proposal would result in an unneighbourly form of development in conflict with policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan - Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
