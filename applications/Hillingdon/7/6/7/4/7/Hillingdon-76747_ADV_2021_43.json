    "The associated advertising on the communication hub by reason of its design, scale, and siting would result in an obtrusive and cluttered public realm detrimental to the character and appearance of the character of the area, street scene, visual amenities and the wider Old Uxbridge/Windsor Street Conservation Area. The advertisement would fail to preserve or enhance the significance, character or appearance of wider listed buildings and would therefore be detrimental to the significance of designated heritage assets which are located within the immediate vicinity of the site. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies HE1 and BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), and DMHB 1, 2, 4, 11, 12 and 13A of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and policy HC1 of The London Plan (2021); and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021)",
    "The decision to REFUSE Advertisement Consent has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE Advertisement Consent has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan (2021) and national guidance."
