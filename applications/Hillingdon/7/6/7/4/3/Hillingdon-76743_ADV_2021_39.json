    "The associated advertising on the proposed communication hub by reason of its design, scale, and siting would result in an obtrusive and cluttered public realm detrimental to the visual amenity, character and appearance of the area, street scene, wider Northwood Town Centre and  Green Lane Conservation Area. It is also considered that the advertisement would disrupt views of and fail to preserve or enhance the significance, character or appearance of the Locally Listed Buildings (Nos76-78). Furthermore, the area is one of the gateways into the conservation area and would therefore be detrimental to the significance of designated heritage assets which are located within the immediate vicinity of the site. The proposal is therefore contrary to policies HE1 and BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), policies DMHB 1, 3, 4, 11, 12 and 13A of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and policy HC1 of The London Pla",
