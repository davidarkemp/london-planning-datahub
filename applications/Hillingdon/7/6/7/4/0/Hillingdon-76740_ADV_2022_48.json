    "The associated advertising on the proposed communication hub by reason of its substantially-sized LCD screen, prominent siting, luminance and design, would result in a visually obtrusive development that would clutter the public realm, detrimental to the character, appearance and vitality of the Northwood Town Centre and street scene. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012); Policies DMHB 11, 12, 13A and 21 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020); Policies D3 and D8 of The London Plan (2021); and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The associated advertising on the proposed communication hub by reason of its substantially-sized LCD screen, prominent siting, luminance and design, would result in an obtrusive and incongruous development that would harm the character and appearance of the Northwood Town Centre, Green Lane Conservation Area and the settings of the locally listed former Barclays Building and Grade II listed Northwood War Memorial. The limited public benefits would not outweigh the less than substantial harm to the designated heritage assets. The proposal would neither preserve nor enhance these heritage assets. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012); policies DMHB 1, 2, 3, 4, 9, 11, and 21 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020); policy HC1 of The London Plan (2021); and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The decision to REFUSE Advertisement Consent has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE Advertisement Consent has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan (2021) and national guidance."
