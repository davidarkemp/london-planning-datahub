    "The Atlas Cedar is situated to the side of 12/14 Sylvana Close and is highly visible from the public highway. It significantly contributes to the arboricultural character of the Hillingdon Court Park Area of Special Local character and has a high amenity value.",
    "The tree does overhang the boundary line between 12 and 14 and in places is close to the building, however a cut back as drastic as back to boundary would introduce multiple large wounds into the canopy and leave the cedar lopsided. The applicant has also mentioned they believe the tree to be a dangerous threat, but no evidence has been provided of this. The applicant may wish to discuss their concerns with the tree owner and/or an Arboricultural Consultant.",
    "Having regard to the reasons given for the proposed work, the work is unjustified and will have a detrimental impact on the visual amenity and arboreal character of the area.",
    "The removal of deadwood, dangerous / hanging branches and ivy:  This does not require the formal consent of the Council."
