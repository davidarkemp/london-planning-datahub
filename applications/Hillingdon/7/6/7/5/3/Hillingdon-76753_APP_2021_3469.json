    "The proposal, by reason of its overall size, siting, design and proximity to the front and side boundary lines would appear at odds with the spacing and character of development in the immediate vicinity, giving rise to a cramped form of development which would intensify the residential use of the site and be detrimental to the visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area, all harming the established character and appearance of the site and surrounding area. The proposal is contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMH 6, DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), Policies D3, D4 and D6 of the London Plan (2021), London Plan (2021) policies H4 and H8 and the NPPF (2021).",
    "The proposed dwelling, by virtue of its scale and proximity, would result in a material loss of residential amenity to the occupants of both the host dwelling at Number 251 Long Lane and the proposed dwelling due to the number and size of the first floor rear facing windows proposed, resulting in an actual or perceived sense of overlooking, failing to provide satisfactory amenities for those properties. The proposal would therefore be in conflict with Policy DMHB11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan - Part Two (2020) and the NPPF (2021).",
    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate a satisfactory policy-led approach to the car parking design, layout and access which could be prejudicial to all road users safety, contrary to policy DMT2 and DMT6 of the Hillingdon Local Plan (2020) and Policy T6 the London Plan (2021).",
    "The proposal fails to provide amenity space of sufficient size and quality commensurate to the size and layout of the said unit and would provide a substandard form of accommodation for future residents contrary to Policy DMHB18 of the Hillingdon Local Plan - Part Two (2020).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan (2021) and national guidance.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "This is a reminder that Under the terms of the Planning Act 2008 (as amended) and Community Infrastructure Levy Regulations 2010 (as amended), should an application for appeal be allowed, the proposed development would be deemed as 'chargeable development' and therefore liable to pay the London Borough of Hillingdon Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and the Mayor of London's Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This would be calculated in accordance with the London Borough of Hillingdon CIL Charging Schedule 2014 and the Mayor of London's CIL Charging Schedule 2012.",
