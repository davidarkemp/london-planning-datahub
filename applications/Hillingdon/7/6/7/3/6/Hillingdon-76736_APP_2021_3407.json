    "The proposed outbuilding and associated alterations, by reason of the combined siting, size, footprint, scale, bulk, excessive height, width and design in this open prominent position, would result in a dominant, incongruous, visually intrusive, overbearing, cramped and contrived form of overdevelopment that would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original property and its curtilage, would be detrimental to the character, appearance and symmetry of the immediate stretch of properties along Belmont Road and Mead Road of which forms part of the North Uxbridge Area of Special Local Character and to the visual amenities of this prominent corner plot street scene and the surrounding area. The sheer massing and size would fail to make the outbuilding ancillary to the ground floor flat - 95A Belmont Road. Therefore, the proposal would be contrary to  Policies D3 and D8 of the London Plan (2021), Policies BE1 and BE5 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic",
    "The proposed outbuilding and associated alterations, by reason of the combined siting, size, footprint, scale, bulk, excessive height, width and design in this open prominent position, would give rise to unacceptable loss of outlook, overbearing impact, visual intrusion, overlooking/loss of privacy, noise and disturbance including light spillage and some loss of daylight/sunlight to the occupiers of no.93 and 95 (first floor flat) Belmont Road and no.1 Mead Road. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to  Policies D3, D4 and D8 of the London Plan (2021), Policies BE1, BE20 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012), Policies DMHD 2, DMH 6, DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The proposed parking arrangements and alterations, by reason of the siting of the excessively large outbuilding, boundary treatment, loss of parking spaces, alongside the potential of a widened crossover would give rise to on-street parking in an area of congestion, and safety and danger implications to the users of the site and surrounding network. The movement to and from the site, especially with the boundary treatment and proposed outbuilding would put vehicles, pedestrians and cyclists at substantial risk. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to  Policies D3, T4, T5, T6 of the London Plan (2021), Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012), Policies DMHD 2, DMH6, DMT 1, DMT 2, DMT 3, DMT 4, DMT 5 and DMT 6 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The proposed outbuilding, by reason of its size and scale, design, physical separation from the garden of the ground floor flat, and independent access is considered capable of independent occupation from the main dwelling and is thus tantamount to a separate dwelling in a position where such a dwelling would not be acceptable as it could result in unacceptable impact on adjoining occupiers and additional requirements for parking and amenity space. The proposal is therefore contrary to policies DMHB 11, DMT 6, DMHB 18 and DMHD 2 of the London Borough of Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "This is a reminder that Under the terms of the Planning Act 2008 (as amended) and Community Infrastructure Levy Regulations 2010 (as amended), should an application for appeal be allowed, the proposed development would be deemed as 'chargeable development' and therefore liable to pay the London Borough of Hillingdon Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and the Mayor of London's Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This would be calculated in accordance with the London Borough of Hillingdon CIL Charging Schedule 2014 and the Mayor of London's CIL Charging Schedule 2012. For more information on CIL matters please visit the planning portal page at: www.planningportal.gov.uk/planning/applications/howtoapply/whattosubmit/cil",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2021). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020."
