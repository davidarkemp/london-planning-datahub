It is considered that the Existing Block Layout submitted as part of the submission does not accurately depict the existing enlargement of the original dwellinghouse, namely the single storey rear extension, and the Proposed Block Layout does not clearly demonstrate whether the existing outbuilding adjacent to the boundary with No.15 Birchway will be demolished as part of the proposed development.  Accordingly, the Local Planning Authority cannot determine whether the enlarged part of the dwellinghouse would be joined to an existing enlargement of the dwellinghouse."
