    "The proposed communication hub, by reason of its design, scale, siting, illumination and creation of additional street clutter, would harm the appearance of the surrounding townscape, Old Uxbridge / Windsor Street Conservation Area and the settings of the adjacent Grade II and Grade II* listed buildings. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies BE1 and HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 1, 3, 4, 11, 12, 13A, 15 and 21 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), policies HC1, D3, D5, D8 and T2 of The London Plan (2021), and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The proposed communication hub, by reason of its scale and siting, would result in a reduction of the width of the public footway, disrupting the inclusive free flow of pedestrian traffic for all users to the detriment of pedestrian and highway safety, contrary to contrary to policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One (November 2012), policies DMHB15 and DMT 2 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policies T2, T4, D3, D5 and D8 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The proposed communication hub, by reason of its design, scale and siting would result in obstructions to sight lines for public realm users having an adverse impact on perceived safety and increased risk of crime and public safety implications, contrary to policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One (November 2012), policy DMHB 15 of the  Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), policies D3 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
