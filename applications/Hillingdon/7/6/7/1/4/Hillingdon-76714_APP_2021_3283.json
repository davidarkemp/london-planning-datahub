    "The proposed Monopole and associated equipment would, by virtue of their siting, size, scale, bulk and height, represent a visually dominant development that would harm the open character of the green belt, setting of Stockley Park Registered Park and Garden and wider area. The development would therefore be contrary to paragraph 115 and Sections 13 and 16 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy G2 of the London Plan (2021), HE1 and EM2 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012) and Policies DMHB 1, DMHB 8, DMHB 21 and DMEI 4 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
