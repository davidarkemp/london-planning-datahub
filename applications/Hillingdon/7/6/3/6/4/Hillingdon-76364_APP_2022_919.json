    "The constructed car port, by reason of its siting, size, width, height and design (including its corrugated metal roof), appears as an incongruous  and visually obtrusive form of development which is detrimental to the visual amenity of the area and neither preserves or enhances but harms the wider setting of the Ruislip Village Conservation Area and Midcroft, Ruislip Area of Special Local Character. The proposal therefore conflicts with Policies BE1 and HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One- Strategic Policies (2012) and Policies DMHB 1, DMHB 4, DMHB 5,  DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020), Policies HC1, D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The constructed car port, when viewed collectively against the other structures and buildings in the car park, has significantly eroded the character and appearance of the site and has detrimentally impacted the visual amenities of the surrounding area, including the wider setting of the Ruislip Village Conservation Area and Midcroft, Ruislip Area of Special Local Character. The proposal therefore conflicts with Policies BE1 and HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One- Strategic Policies (2012) and Policies DMHB 1, DMHB 4, DMHB 5,  DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020), Policies HC1, D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The constructed car port, by virtue of its siting, size, width, height and design, has caused significant harm to the residential amenities of the existing occupiers at numbers 4, 6, and 6a Brickwall Lane and the upper floor rear flats at Neyland Court, in terms of loss of outlook, overbearing impact and visual intrusion. The proposal is therefore be contrary to Policy DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (January 2020) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "a) We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal.",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan - The Spatial Development Strategy for London consolidated with alterations since 2011 (2016) and national guidance."
