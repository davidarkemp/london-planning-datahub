    "The proposed office management building, by virtue of its proximity, size, scale, bulk, massing and elevated height, would cause significant harm to the living conditions of the neighbouring occupiers and their associated external amenity space, at Neyland Court, number 19 Pembroke Road and numbers 4, 6, 6a and 8 Brickwall Lane, in terms of loss of outlook, overshadowing, overbearing impact, sense of enclosure and perceived loss of privacy.  The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policy DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (January 2020) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The proposed boundary treatment comprising brick wall, piers and metal railings, by virtue of its proximity, length, 1.8 metre height and design would cause significant harm to the residential amenities of the existing occupiers of the ground floor flats at Neyland Court, in terms of loss of outlook, overbearing impact and sense of enclosure. The proposal would therefore result in substandard forms of internal residential accommodation to the detriment of the amenity of the existing occupiers at Neyland Court. This would be contrary to Policy DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (January 2020) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The proposed development, by virtue of the proximity of the on-site car parking spaces labelled 13 to 16 and the inadequate provision of soft landscaping screening, would cause unacceptable noise, disturbance, overlooking and a loss of privacy (both real and perceived) for the existing occupiers of the ground floor flats at Neyland Court. The proposal would therefore result in substandard forms of internal residential accommodation to the detriment of the amenity of the existing occupiers at Neyland Court. This would be contrary to Policy DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (January 2020) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The proposed development, by virtue of the proximity of the on-site car parking spaces labelled 13 to 16 and the inadequate provision of soft landscaping screening, would severely undermine the quality, usability and functionality of the communal amenity space at Neyland Court. The proposal would therefore result in substandard forms of external residential accommodation to the detriment of the amenity of the existing occupiers at Neyland Court. This would be contrary to Policy DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (January 2020) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "a) We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal.",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan (2021) and national guidance."
