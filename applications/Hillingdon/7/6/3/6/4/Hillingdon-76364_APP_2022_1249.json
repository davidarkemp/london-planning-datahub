    "The proposed development, by reason of its prominent location, size, scale, massing, height, design and choice of external finishes would result in an incongruous form of overdevelopment that would fail to harmonise with the character and architectural composition of the surrounding properties, appearing as a visually dominant and bulky form of development which would be detrimental to the character, appearance and visual amenity of the street scene and the setting of the adjoining Ruislip Village Conservation Area and Midcroft, Ruislip Area of Special Local Character. The proposal therefore conflicts with Policies BE1 and HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One- Strategic Policies (2012) and Policies DMHB 1, DMHB 4, DMHB 5, DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020), Policies HC1, D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The proposed development, by reason of its built footprint projecting beyond the front and rear habitable room windows on the existing building, would cause harm to the living conditions of the existing occupiers at Neyland Court, in terms of loss of light, loss of outlook, sense of enclosure and overbearing impact. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One- Strategic Policies (2012), Policy DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The proposed development, by reason of its siting, size, scale, bulk, massing and height, would cause harm to the residential amenities of the neighbouring occupiers at Pembroke House, number 19 Pembroke Road and numbers 4, 6, 6a and 8 Brickwall Lane, in terms of loss of outlook, loss of light, overshadowing, sense of enclosure and overbearing impact. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One- Strategic Policies (2012), Policy DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The proposed refuse store and long stay cycle store, by virtue of their proximity to the ground floor habitable room windows of an existing flat at Neyland Court, would cause harm to the residential amenities enjoyed by this neighbouring occupier/occupiers, in terms of loss of outlook, loss of privacy, noise and disturbance. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One- Strategic Policies (2012), Policy DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "Insufficient evidence has been provided to demonstrate that adequate refuse and recycling facilities can be provided for the existing and future occupiers of the proposed development without adversely impacting upon neighbouring residential amenity, on-site parking provision or highway safety. This issue is further exacerbated by the constrained nature of the site. The proposal would therefore conflict with Policy DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "Insufficient evidence has been provided to demonstrate that secure, sheltered and accessible long stay cycle store parking spaces can be provided for future occupiers of the proposed development without adversely impacting upon the external amenity space provision at the site, on-site parking provision or highway safety. This issue is further exacerbated by the constrained nature of the site. The proposal would therefore fail to facilitate and encourage cycling as a sustainable mode of transport contrary to Policy DMT 5 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020) and Policy T5 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The proposed development fails to provide any three or more bedroom (family sized) units. Robust justification has not been provided to demonstrate that the provision of family sized units would be unsuitable or unviable. The proposal would therefore not provide a suitable mix of housing to support sustainable, inclusive and mixed communities contrary to Policy DMH 2 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy H10 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The proposed development, by reason of its inadequate size, quality and functionality of external amenity space provision, would result in substandard forms of residential accommodation to the detriment of existing and future occupants at the site. The proposal therefore conflicts with Policy DMHB 18 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The proposal fails to demonstrate how the development would achieve the highest standards of fire safety in regard to its design in incorporating appropriate features which reduce the risk to life in the event of a fire, its construction methods, means of escape,",
    "strategy of evacuation and providing suitable access and equipment for firefighting appropriate for the size and residential nature of the development. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policies D5 and D11 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan (2021) and national guidance.",
    "This is a reminder that Under the terms of the Planning Act 2008 (as amended) and Community Infrastructure Levy Regulations 2010 (as amended), should an application for appeal be allowed, the proposed development would be deemed as 'chargeable development' and therefore liable to pay the London Borough of Hillingdon Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and the Mayor of London's Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This would be calculated in accordance with the London Borough of Hillingdon CIL Charging Schedule 2014 and the Mayor of London's CIL Charging Schedule 2012.",
