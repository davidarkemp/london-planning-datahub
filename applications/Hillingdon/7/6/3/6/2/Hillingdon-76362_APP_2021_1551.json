    "The proposed development would have a harmful impact on the character and appearance of the area and wider East and West Walk Area of Special Local Character by significantly altering the plan arrangement of the estate, infilling a pocket of green open space, intensifying the developed nature of the area and setting an unwelcome precedent on similar sites being developed. Furthermore, the proposed bungalow would be at complete odds with the surrounding built environment, in terms of its siting, scale, size and design. The proposal therefore conflicts with the NPPF, Policies HC1, D1, D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021), Policies BE1 and HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012) and Policies DMHB 1, DMHB 5,  DMHB 11 and DMHB 12  of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The proposal fails to demonstrate that the proposed 'car-free' development would not give rise to adverse impacts upon the highway network to the detriment of on-street parking capacity and highway congestion/safety contrary to paragraph 111 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies T4 ,T6 and T6.1 of the London Plan (2021) and  Policies DMT 1,  DMT 2, DMT 6 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The proposal fails to demonstrate how the development would achieve safe and suitable access to the site for prospective occupiers given that the official public footway from West Walk has been paved over and subsumed as part of the front driveway at number 16 West Walk. The proposal would therefore be contrary to paragraph 110 (b) of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021) and Policy DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two- Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The proposal fails to demonstrate how the development would achieve the highest standards of fire safety in regard to its design in incorporating appropriate features which reduce the risk of life in the event of a fire, its construction methods, means of escape, strategy of evacuation and providing suitable access and equipment for firefighting appropriate for the size and residential nature of the development. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policy D11 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan - The Spatial Development Strategy for London consolidated with alterations since 2011 (2016) and national guidance.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service."
