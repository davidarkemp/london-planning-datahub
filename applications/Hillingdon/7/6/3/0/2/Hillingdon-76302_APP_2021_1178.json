    "The proposed development fails to provide sufficient off-street parking provision which meets the Councils approved parking standards to service the existing dwelling. The development would therefore lead to additional on-street parking to the detriment of public and highway safety and is therefore contrary to Policies DMT 2 and DMT 6 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",

    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan - The Spatial Development Strategy for London consolidated with alterations since 2011 (2016) and national guidance.",
