    "The proposed ground floor rear extension, by reason of its bulk, massing and design would result in a discordant and unsympathetic addition to the dwelling which would erode the established character and appearance of the host dwelling and the wider surrounding context. The extension would further fail to establish an acceptable quality of internal living spaces resulting in reduced access to natural light and outlook.  The proposal is therefore considered contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB11; DMHB12 and DMHD1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan - Part Two (2020) and Policies D4 , D6 and D8 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "The proposed ground floor rear extension, by virtue of its depth and proximity to the boundary and poor relationship to the adjoining residential properties would be detrimental to the amenities of the dwelling at No.29 and 25 Deane Avenue by reason of overdominance, visual intrusion, loss of light and loss of outlook. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB11; DMHB12 and DMHD1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan - Part Two (2020) and Policies D4 and D6 of the London Plan (2021)."
