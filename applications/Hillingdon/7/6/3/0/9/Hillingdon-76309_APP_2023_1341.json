    "The proposal by reason of its excessive scale, bulk and nil setback would result in an incongruous and visually intrusive form of development that would not be a subordinate addition to the existing dwellinghouse, would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original dwelling and adjoining semi detached dwelling and would be detrimental to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the surrounding area. Therefore, the proposed development would be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan (November 2012), Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan - Part Two (2020) and Policies D3 of the London Plan (2021) and Chapter 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The proposed two storey side and single storey rear extensions by reason of its size, scale, projection, and proximity to the shared boundaries would result in loss of outlook and overbearing effect which would have a direct impact on the amenities of 25 and 29 Deane Avenue, contrary to the aims and requirements of Policy DMHB11 and DMHD1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan - Part Two (2020).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service. We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
