    "The proposed extensions, in particular the first floor rear element, by reason of its siting, size, scale, bulk, height and proximity, would be detrimental to the amenities of the adjoining occupier at  57 Harlyn Drive, by reason of overdominance, overshadowing, visual intrusion, overbearing impact, loss of daylight/sunlight and loss of outlook. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The proposed development, by reason of its combined height, bulk, width and depth, alongside the flat roof nature, would result in an excessive, bulky, incongruous, dominant, overbearing and visually intrusive form of development that would substantially harm the form, proportion and appearance of the existing dwelling and its relationship with the immediate properties and would be detrimental to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area. As such, the proposal would be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
