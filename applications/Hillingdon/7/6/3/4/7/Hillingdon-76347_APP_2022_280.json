  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed development, by virtue of its siting, size, scale, bulk and width, would fail to appear as a subordinate addition, would be detrimental to the character, appearance and symmetry of the small terrace of houses of which it forms a part and to the visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), Policies D1, D3 and D6 of the London Plan (2021), as well as paragraphs 71, 124 and 130 of the NPPF (2021).",
    "The proposed extension, by reason of its size, scale, bulk and projection forward of the recognised established return line along this side of Warwick Crescent on this corner plot, is considered to represent an unduly intrusive and incongruous form of development within the street scene. As such, the proposal would be harmful to the visual amenities of the street scene and open spacious character of this plot and surrounding area, contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), Policies D1, D3 and D6 of the London Plan (2021), as well as paragraphs 71, 124 and 130 of the NPPF (2021).",
    "No step free access has been shown for the proposed dwelling and the internal arrangement of the dwelling would fail to meet the requirements for a M4(2) accessible and adaptable dwelling as set out in Approved Document M to the Building Regulations (2015 edition). The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy D7 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan and national guidance."
