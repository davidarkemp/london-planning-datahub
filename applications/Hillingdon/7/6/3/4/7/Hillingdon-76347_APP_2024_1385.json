    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate that the proposed development would not cause harm to or loss of surrounding Warwick Crescent trees. Damaging these trees could be detrimental to the character and quality of the site and surrounding area, contrary to Paragraph 136 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023), Policy G7 of The London Plan (2021) and Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12, and DMHB 14 of Hillingdon Council's Local Plan Part Two Development Management Policies (2020) and is therefore recommended for refusal.",
    "In the absence of sufficient biodiversity information, it has not been demonstrated that the proposal would deliver at least a 10% increase in biodiversity value relative to the pre-development biodiversity value of the onsite habitat. The development fails to deliver a biodiversity net gain within the borough and fails to secure the protection and effective management of the remaining habitat on site. As such, the proposal is contrary to Schedule 7A of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 and the Environment Act 2021, Policy G6 of the London Plan 2021, Policy EM7 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012), and Policies DMEI 7 and DMHB 14 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two (2020).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan and national guidance."
