    "The proposed development, by reason of its inappropriate siting on an open parcel of grassed verge, plot size, size, scale and detached form of the proposed dwelling, would erode the open character of the site and result in an incongruous and visually obtrusive form of development which would fail to respect the established pattern of development in the local area and the surrounding street scape. As such, the proposal would have a detrimental impact on the character, appearance and visual amenities of the existing street scene and the residential area as a whole. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012), Policies DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020), Policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The application fails to demonstrate that the open/amenity space to be lost to the development is surplus to requirements. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy DMCI 3 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy G4 of the London Plan (2021) and paragraph 99 of the National Planning Policy Framework.",
    "The proposed development, by virtue of the application site falling in Flood Zone 3a, would not be a suitable location for the erection of a proposed dwelling. This is because the submitted Flood Risk Assessment fails to demonstrate that the proposed development will be safe, without increasing flood risk elsewhere. No robust evidence has been submitted to demonstrate that there are no other sequentially preferable alternative sites for the proposed development. Also, the proposal fails the Exception Test as the benefits of the proposed development would not outweigh the flood risk. The proposal fails to demonstrate that future occupants would be safe in the event of a flood, and fails to steer new development away from areas at the highest risk of flooding. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy EM6 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies (2012), Policy DMEI 9 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy SI 12 of the L",
    "The proposed development, by virtue of the loss of the existing mature trees at the site,  would cause harm to the open and verdant character and appearance of the site and would introduce an urbanising form of development that would not integrate well with its surroundings. The proposed replacement trees would not mitigate the harm caused to the character and appearance of the area. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012), Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHB 14 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020), Policies D3, D4 and G7 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The proposed development, by virtue of its proximity, scale, depth and side gable roof design,  would result in an undue loss of outlook, visual intrusion and overbearing impact for the neighbouring occupiers residing at numbers 1 to 4 Wheelers Drive. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012), Policy DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The internal parking bay length and width within the proposed garage fails to meet the required standard as defined within Policy DMT 6, Appendix C - Table 1(a) section 8(a) of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020). As a consequence, future occupiers of the proposed development are likely to rely on street parking spaces. This in turn, would have the potential to lead to undue displaced on-street parking to the detriment of parking capacity and safety on the local public highway, contrary to Policies DMT 1, DMT 2 and DMT 6 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy T4, T6 and T6.1 of the London Plan (2021) and paragraph 111 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan (2021) and national guidance.",
    "This is a reminder that Under the terms of the Planning Act 2008 (as amended) and Community Infrastructure Levy Regulations 2010 (as amended), should an application for appeal be allowed, the proposed development would be deemed as 'chargeable development' and therefore liable to pay the London Borough of Hillingdon Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and the Mayor of London's Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This would be calculated in accordance with the London Borough of Hillingdon CIL Charging Schedule 2014 and the Mayor of London's CIL Charging Schedule 2012.",
