    "The development hereby permitted shall not be carried out except in complete accordance with the details shown on the submitted plans, number BD/21/06/2A and BD/21/06/3A.",

    "To ensure the development complies with the provisions of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020), and the London Plan (2021).",
    "The materials to be used in the construction of the external surfaces of the development hereby permitted shall match those used in the existing building and shall thereafter be retained as such.",
    "REASON",
    "To safeguard the visual amenities of the area and to ensure that the proposed development does not have an adverse effect upon the appearance of the existing building in accordance with Policy DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 (2020)",
    "Notwithstanding the provisions of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 2015 (as amended) (or any order revoking and re-enacting that Order with or without modification), no additional windows, doors or other openings shall be constructed in the walls or roof slopes of the development hereby approved facing nos. 27 and 31 Woodlands Avenue, Ruislip.",
    "REASON",
    "To prevent overlooking to adjoining properties in accordance with Policy DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 (2020).",
    "The application site forms part of a Critical Drainage Area. Accordingly, the Council's Flood and Water Management Team advise that the development should minimise the water from the application site entering the sewers. Water run off from any roof or hard paving associated with the development should be directed to a soakaway, tank or be made permeable. It is also recommended that a water butt is incorporated. No drainage to support the extension should be connected to any existing surface water network, other than as an overflow."
