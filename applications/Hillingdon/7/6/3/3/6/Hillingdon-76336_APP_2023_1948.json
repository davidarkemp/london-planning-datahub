    "The proposed two storey side extension, two storey rear extension and erection of rear dormer, by virtue of their design, scale, bulk and siting would represent a disproportionate addition to the original dwellinghouse that would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original semi-detached dwellinghouse (and its neighbour), harming the visual amenities of the street scene, as well as the character and appearance of the Area of Special Local Character. The proposal would therefore be contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 1, DMHB 5, DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2021). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020."
