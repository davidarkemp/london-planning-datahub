  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed single storey rear extension, by virtue of its size, scale, bulk and depth and close proximity to the boundary with the adjoining property, would be detrimental to the amenities of the adjoining occupier at 161 Lansbury Drive by reason of overdominance, overshadowing, visual intrusion and loss of outlook. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB11 and DMHD1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "The proposed single storey rear extension, by reason of its size, scale, bulk and depth, would overwhelm and detract from the modest footprint of the host dwelling, would fail to appear as a subordinate addition and would thus be detrimental to the appearance of the original house and the visual amenities, character and appearance of the wider area. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "The roof alteration/extensions, by reason of the size, scale, bulk, and design of the rear dormer window would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original terraced dwelling, would be detrimental to the character, appearance of the original property and the terrace houses of which it forms a part and to the visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",

We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service."
