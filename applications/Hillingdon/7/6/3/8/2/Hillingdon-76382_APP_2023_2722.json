    "The hip to gable end roof conversion, front, side and rear dormer by reason of their cumulative size, scale, bulk, height and design, would result in a disproportionate, visually obtrusive and top heavy form of development that would be detrimental to the appearance of the original host dwelling, and would cause harm to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the existing street scene. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2021), Policies DMHD 1, DMHB 1,  DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management (2020), Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021) and Chapter 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
