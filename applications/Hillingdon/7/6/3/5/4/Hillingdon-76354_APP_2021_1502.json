    "The proposed development would  fail to safeguard protected trees to the detriment of the character of the Ickenham Village Conservation Area and the local area.

    "The proposed side extension would substantially harm the symmetry of the pair of attached properties. This would have a negative impact on the appearance of the street scene and the character and appearance of the Ickenham Village Conservation Area. Furthermore, the proposed set back from the front, particularly at first floor is considered inadequate.
