    "The variation of Condition 7 and the fully opening capability of the first floor side windows serving the en-suite and bathroom does not accord with the approved plans and conditions and has a significant direct and unacceptable overlooking impact upon the main outdoor amenity space of No. 9 Court Road. The proposal therefore fails to maintain a high standard of residential amenity for users and occupiers of the neighbouring properties. The proposal would fail to comply with the requirements of Policies DMHD 1, DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021)."
