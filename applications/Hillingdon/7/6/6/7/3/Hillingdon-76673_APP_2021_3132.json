    "Due to their irregular size, design, lack of streetscene frontage and backland location the proposed dwellings would form an uncharacteristic and incongruous form of development which would fail to harmonise with the established character of the area. Furthermore the resulting gardens would be unusually small, when compared with other properties in the area to the detriment of the areas character. Overall it is considered that the proposal would be detrimental to the character of the area, contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies, Policies DMH 6, DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policies D1 and D3 of the London Plan (2021), as well as paragraphs 124 and 130 of the NPPF (2021).",
    "Both of the new 2 bed, 3 person dwellings would fail to provide 61sqm of internal floor space for their future occupiers. The properties would therefore provide an indoor living area of an unsatisfactory size for their future occupiers, giving rise to a substandard form of living accommodation to the detriment of the amenity of their future occupiers. The proposed development is therefore contrary to the requirements of Policy D6 A of the London Plan (2021), Policy DMHB 16 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and the Technical Housing Standards - Nationally Described Space Standard (2015).",
    "The proposed development fails to demonstrate that the proposed parking plan functions and is fit for purpose. Failure to provide a functional parking arrangement would result in vehicles being displaced onto the local highways network. Roadside parking would create a more hazardous environment for road users and pedestrians. It would also also have an adverse impact on the free flow of traffic on the local highways network. The development is therefore considered to be contrary to Policies DMT 2 and DMT 6 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), as well as policy T4 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "The proposed development would lead to harmful increase in people and vehicle movements in and out of the site which would subsequently cause noise, nuisance and disturbance to the occupiers of No.44 to No.45 Zealand Avenue. The development is therefore considered to be contrary to Policies DMH 6 and DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), as well as paragraph 130 (f) of the NPPF (2021).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan (2021)."
