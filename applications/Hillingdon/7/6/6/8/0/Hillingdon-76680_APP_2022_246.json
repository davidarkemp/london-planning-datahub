  "description": "Conversion of single dwelling to 2 no. two-bed self-contained flats, including erection of single storey rear extension with 2 x rooflights and conversion of roof space to habitable use to include a rear dormer with 3 x front roof lights and conversion of roof from hip to gable end with new gable end window and associated internal alterations",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The development leads to an unacceptable residential conversion where the internal floor area of the original building to be converted is less than 120 sqm and results in the loss of a three-bedroom dwellinghouse for which there is an established need in the Borough. The residential conversion is also sited on a street where more than 10% of the properties are in use as flats. The development is therefore contrary to the requirements of Policies DMH 2 and DMH 4 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020) and would fail to enhance the local character of the area by resulting in a concentration of flats and a loss of family accommodation.",
    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate that adequate and functional car and cycle parking spaces could be provided for occupiers of the proposed flats. Therefore, the proposal would be prejudicial to all road users safety, contrary to policy DMT6 of the Hillingdon Local",
    "Plan - Part Two (2020) and Policies T5 and T6 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate adequate floor to ceiling height for future occupiers of Flat 2, resulting in a poor quality, substandard residential accommodation for future occupiers. Accordingly, the new flats are considered to be contrary to the requirements of Policy D6 A of the London Plan (2021), Policy DMHB 16 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and the Technical Housing Standards - Nationally Described Space Standard (2015).",
    "The proposed hip to gable roof conversion and full width rear dormer, by reason of their size, scale, bulk and design, would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original dwelling and would be detrimental to the character, appearance and visual amenities of this uniform terrace, street scene and the surrounding area. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan (2021) and national guidance.",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination)."
