    "The proposed communications hub, by reason of its design, scale, and siting would result in an obtrusive and cluttered public realm detrimental to the visual amenity, character and appearance of the area, street scene, Old Uxbridge/Windsor Street and the settings of statutory and locally listed buildings. The proposal is therefore contrary to policies HE1 and BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), policies DMHB 1, 4, 11, 12, 13A, 15, 21 and DMT 2 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policies HC1, D3, D5, D8 and T2 of The London Plan (2021); and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The proposed communications hub, by reason of its scale and siting, would result in a reduction of the width of the public footway, disrupting the inclusive free flow of pedestrian traffic for all users to the detriment of pedestrian and highway safety, contrary to contrary to policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One (November 2012), policies DMHB15 and DMT 2 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policies T2, T4, D3, D5 and D8 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan (2021) and National Guidance."
