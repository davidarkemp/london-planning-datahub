    "Condition 15 of planning permission ref 76608/APP/2022/197, shall be reworded to read as follows:",
    "Prior to the occupation of the development hereby permitted, a scheme to deal with unacceptable contamination, (including asbestos materials detected within the soil), shall be submitted to and approved by the Local Planning Authority (LPA). All works which form part of any required remediation scheme shall be completed before any part of the development is occupied or brought into use unless the Local Planning Authority dispenses with any such requirement specifically and in writing. The scheme shall include the following measures unless the LPA dispenses with any such requirement specifically and in writing:",
    "(a) A written method statement providing details of the remediation scheme and how the completion of the remedial works will be verified shall be agreed in writing with the LPA prior to commencement, along with the details of a watching brief to address undiscovered contamination.",
    "Condition 12 of planning permission ref 76608/APP/2022/197, shall be reworded to read as follows:",
    "The proposed development shall be carried out and maintained in accordance with the submitted Low Emission Strategy (Low Emission Strategy, Iceni Projects - Dated December 2022).",
    "REASON: As the application site is within an Air Quality Management Area, and to reduce the impact on air quality in accordance with policy EM8 of the Local Plan: Part 1 (November 2012), policy DMEI 14 of the London Borough of Hillingdon Local Plan (part 2), the London Borough of Hillingdon Air Quality Action Plan 2019-2023, London Plan (2021) policy SI1 and T4, and paragraphs 174(e), 186 and 188 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).'",
    "With the exception of Conditions 7 (which has been removed as part of this permission) and Conditions 12 and 15 (which have been reworded as part of this permission), the development shall otherwise be carried out, retained, and maintained in compliance with all other approved details and conditions of planning application numbers 76608/APP/2022/197 and 76608/APP/2022/3673.",
    "The decision to GRANT planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to GRANT planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan (2021) and NPPF (2023).",
    "The Equality Act 2010 seeks to protect people accessing goods, facilities and services from discrimination on the basis of a 'protected characteristic', which includes those with a disability. As part of the Act, service providers are obliged to improve access to and within the structure of their building, particularly in situations where reasonable adjustment can be incorporated with relative ease. The Act states that service providers should think ahead to take steps to address barriers that impede disabled people."
