    "The proposed part single storey, part two storey side and rear extension, by reason of its siting in this open prominent position, size, scale, bulk, width and design, including a flat/crown roof, would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original dwelling and would be detrimental to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020) as well as paragraphs 130 (a) and (c) of the NPPF (2021).",
    "The proposed part single storey, part two storey side and rear extension, by reason of its size, scale, bulk, height, depth, width and proximity to the side boundary, in this open prominent position, would result in the closing of an important gap characteristic to the area, resulting in a cramped appearance. The proposal would therefore represent an overdevelopment of the site to the detriment of the visual amenities of the street scene and the character and appearance of the surrounding area. The proposed development is therefore contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies, as well as paragraphs 130 (a) and (c) of the NPPF (2021).",
    "The proposed two storey side extension, by virtue of its siting, size, scale and design, including the lack of a set back from the front at all levels, would fail to appear as a subordinate addition and would thus be detrimental to the appearance of the original house, the visual amenities of the street scene and the character and appearance of the wider area. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "The proposed development would result in 5 bedroom property with 1 parking space, as such inadequate parking would be provided for future occupiers of the dwelling. Insufficient parking could lead to vehicles parking at the side of the road near this corner plot. Road side parking in this area would lead to traffic build up, congestion and an unsafe environment for road users. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies DMT2 and DMT6 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020)."
