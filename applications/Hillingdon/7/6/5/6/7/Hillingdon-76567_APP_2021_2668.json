    "Due to its excessive width, height and bulk the proposed side extension would form an oversized and visually dominant addition to the dwelling, which would harm its architectural composition and appearance. The proposed development is therefore considered to be significantly harmful to the appearance of the host dwelling and contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "Due to its prominent corner plot siting, excessive width, height and bulk the proposed side extension would form an oversized and visually dominant addition to the dwelling, which would harm the visual symmetry and balance that currently exists with the neighbouring semi detached property (No.35 Leybourne Road). Harm to the appearance of the pair of semis would cause harm to the visual amenities of the street scene. The proposed development is therefore considered to be significantly harmful to the character and appearance of the area and contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), as well as paragraphs 130 (a) and 130 (c) of the NPPF (2021).",
    "The proposed development would result in the creation of a 4 bedroom dwelling with 69square metres of private amenity space. The development would therefore fail to meet the amenity space requirements set out in Policy DMHB 18 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and is therefore considered to provide a substandard amount of private amenity space for future occupiers of the resulting dwelling, subsequently harming their amenities.",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan (2021) and national guidance."
