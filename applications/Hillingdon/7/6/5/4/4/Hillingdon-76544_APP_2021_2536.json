    "The proposed development, by reason of it siting in this open prominent position, size, scale and bulk, would result in the loss of a substantial proportion of an important gap, characteristic to the area, which would breach the return building line and would be detrimental to the character, appearance of the street scene and the surrounding area. As such the proposal would conflict with Policies DMHB 11, DMHB12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local plan - Part Two (2020) Policies D4 and D8 of the London Plan (2021) and the NPPF (2021).",
    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate a satisfactory policy-led approach to the car and cycle parking provision and layout for both the donor and new dwelling which could be prejudicial to all road users safety, contrary to policy DMT6 of the Hillingdon Local Plan - Part Two (2020) and Policy T5 and T6 London Plan (2021).",
    "The proposal fails to provide amenity space of sufficient size and quality commensurate to the size and layout of the existing and proposed units. As such the proposal would provide a substandard form of accommodation for future residents contrary to Policies DMHB 11 and DMHB 18 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "Due to the proposed siting of the off street parking bays and direct pedestrian access for the existing dwelling, it is considered this would result in a large area of hardstanding/parking on this frontage, and would not allow sufficient space to mitigate this impact by way of soft landscaping. The proposal would therefore be detrimental to the visual amenities of the street scene and character and appearance of the wider area, contrary to Policy  BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan (November 2012); Policies DMHB11, DMHB12 and DMHB14 of the Hillingdon Local Plan - Part Two (2020) and Polciies D4 and D8 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "The proposed dwelling, by reason of its size, design and layout fails to provide a dwelling which meets the requirements of people with disabilities and would therefore give rise to a substandard form of living accommodation to the detriment of the amenity of future occupiers. The proposal is thus contrary to Policy D7 of the London Plan (2016).",
    "The proposal fails to provide a single bedroom of sufficient size and would therefore give rise to a substandard form of living accommodation to the detriment of the amenity of future occupiers. The proposal is thus contrary to Policy DMHB 16 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy D6 and Table 3.1 of the London Plan (2021), the Mayor of London's adopted Supplementary Planning Guidance - Housing (March 2016) and the Technical Housing Standards - Nationally Described Space Standard (March 2015).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to GRANT/REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan -(2021) and national guidance.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal.",
    "This is a reminder that Under the terms of the Planning Act 2008 (as amended) and Community Infrastructure Levy Regulations 2010 (as amended), should an application for appeal be allowed, the proposed development would be deemed as 'chargeable development' and therefore liable to pay the London Borough of Hillingdon Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and the Mayor of London's Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This would be calculated in accordance with the London Borough of Hillingdon CIL Charging Schedule 2014 and the Mayor of London's CIL Charging Schedule 2012.",
