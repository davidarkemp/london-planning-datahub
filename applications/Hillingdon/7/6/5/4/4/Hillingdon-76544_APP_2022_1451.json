    "The proposed development, by reason of it siting in this open prominent position, size, scale and bulk, would result in the loss of a substantial proportion of an important gap, characteristic to the area, which would breach the return building line and would be detrimental to the character, appearance of the street scene and the surrounding area. As such the proposal would conflict with Policies DMHB 11, DMHB12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local plan - Part Two (2020) Policies D4 and D8 of the London Plan (2021) and the NPPF (2021).",
    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate a satisfactory policy-led approach to the car and cycle parking provision and layout for both the donor and new dwelling which could be prejudicial to all road users safety, contrary to policy DMT6 of the Hillingdon Local Plan - Part Two (2020) and Policy T5 and T6 London Plan (2021).",
    "The proposal fails to provide outdoor amenity space of sufficient size and quality commensurate to the size and layout of the existing and proposed units. As such the proposal would provide a substandard form of accommodation for future residents contrary to Policies DMHB 11 and DMHB 18 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "Due to the proposed siting of the off street parking bays and direct pedestrian access for the existing dwelling, it is considered this would result in a large area of hardstanding/parking on this frontage, and would not allow sufficient space to mitigate this impact by way of soft landscaping. The proposal would therefore be detrimental to the visual amenities of the street scene and character and appearance of the wider area, contrary to Policy  BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan (November 2012); Policies DMHB11, DMHB12 and DMHB14 of the Hillingdon Local Plan - Part Two (2020) and Polciies D4 and D8 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service. This is a resubmission of a previously refused scheme, where the Officers Report identified issues to be addressed, which were reflected in the reasons for refusal, allowing the opportunity to address those issues within this submission."
