    "The proposed telecommunications monopole and associated equipment would, by virtue of their prominent position, size, scale, bulk and height, represent prominent and incongruous features in the street scene that would cause significant harm to the character and appearance of the area. Furthermore, the proposed telecommunications monopole and associated equipment would have a detrimental impact on the visual amenities of the area, which includes views from neighbouring residential properties. The development would therefore be contrary to paragraphs 115 and 130 c) of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies D1, D4, D8 and SI6 of the London Plan (2021), Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One- Strategic Policies (2012) and Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHB 21 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The Local Planning Authority considers that the applicants have failed to provide robust evidence to demonstrate that other more suitable and less harmful sites do not exist, and that they have actively explored the possibility of erecting the proposed telecommunications equipment on existing buildings, masts or other structures. The development would therefore be contrary to paragraphs 115 and 117 c) of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), and Policy DMHB 21 of the  Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020)."
