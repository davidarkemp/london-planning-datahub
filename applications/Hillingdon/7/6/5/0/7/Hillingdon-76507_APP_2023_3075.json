    "The proposed hip to gable conversion, by virtue of the inappropriate design, scale,  bulk and massing, would appear as a  incongruous addition that would fail to respect the original roof form,  architectural composition of the original dwelling and would be a departure from the alternating roof forms within the street scene . Consequently, the proposal would cause significant harm to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the host property and the surrounding area, contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020) and paragraph 135 of the NPPF (2023).",

    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan (2021) and NPPF (2023)."
