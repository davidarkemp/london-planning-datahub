    "By virtue of its siting, size, scale, bulk, massing, height, design and external finish, the proposed additional storey, together with the rear dormer and extended external staircase, would result in a dominant, incongruous and visually obtrusive form of development. The proposal would therefore cause significant harm to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the host building and the surrounding area, contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One- Strategic Policies (2012), Policies DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two- Development Management Policies (2020), Policies D1, D3 and D4 of the London Plan and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The proposed development, by reason of its proximity, size, scale, bulk, massing, height and design, would cause harm to the living conditions of the neighbouring residential occupiers at numbers 73a and 75a Victoria Road, in terms of outlook, light, overbearing impact and sense of enclosure. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One- Strategic Policies (2012), Policy DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two- Development Management Policies (2020) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The proposed development, by virtue of its poor outlook, poor levels of natural light and inadequate external amenity space provision would result in a substandard form of residential accommodation to the detriment of the amenity of future occupants. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policies DMHB 16 and DMHB 18 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2- Development Management Policies (2020), Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The proposed refuse and cycle store provision, by reason of its proximity and siting, would cause unacceptable harm to the residential amenities of the neighbouring residential occupiers at number 73a Victoria Road, in terms of loss privacy, noise and disturbance. Also, due to the constrained nature of the site, it is questioned whether the refuse and cycle store could be re-located to an alternative location that would not prejudice the quality of accommodation for existing or future occupiers at the site.  The proposal would therefore conflict with Policies DMHB 11 and DMT 5 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2- Development Management Policies (2020), Policy T5 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan - The Spatial Development Strategy for London consolidated with alterations since 2011 (2016) and national guidance.",
    "This is a reminder that Under the terms of the Planning Act 2008 (as amended) and Community Infrastructure Levy Regulations 2010 (as amended), should an application for appeal be allowed, the proposed development would be deemed as 'chargeable development' and therefore liable to pay the London Borough of Hillingdon Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and the Mayor of London's Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This would be calculated in accordance with the London Borough of Hillingdon CIL Charging Schedule 2014 and the Mayor of London's CIL Charging Schedule 2012.",
