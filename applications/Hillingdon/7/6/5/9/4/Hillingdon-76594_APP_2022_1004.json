    "Due to the combination of its location, height, width, and resulting bulk, the proposed dwelling would disrupt and unbalance the visual symmetry which exists with the neighbouring semi detached dwelling. For the same reasons the proposal would lead to the loss of the important visual spacing between No.13 and No.11 Laburnum Avenue, good visual spacing between properties characterises the area and the proposal would therefore be harmful and out of character. Additional harm would be caused to the areas appearance due to the excessive hard landscaping proposed to the front of the site and the introduction of a three dwelling terrace, which would be visually at odds with the larger terraces and smaller semi detached properties which characterise the area. The proposed dwelling would therefore be detrimental to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the street and wider area. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategi",
    "The existing and proposed dwellings would be provided with substandard, inadequate parking. The shortfall in parking is likely to result in roadside parking which would create a more hazardous environment for road users, whilst also causing traffic build up and congestion as vehicles stop to pass parked vehicles. The proposal is therefore considered to result in a more dangerous and hazardous environment for pedestrians and vehicle users of the site. it would also also have an adverse impact on the free flow of traffic on the local highways network. The proposed development is therefore considered to be contrary to Policies DMT 2 and DMT 6 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), as well as policy T4 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the 'Saved' UDP 2007, Local Plan Part 1, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service. This is a resubmission of a previously refused scheme, where the Officers Report identified issues to be addressed, which were reflected in the reasons for refusal, allowing the opportunity to address those issues within this submission."
