    "Due to the combination of its location, height, width, and resulting bulk, the proposed dwelling would disrupt and unbalance the visual symmetry which exists with the neighbouring semi detached dwelling. For the same reasons the proposal would lead to the loss of the important visual spacing between No.13 and No.11 Laburnum Avenue, good visual spacing between properties characterises the area and the proposal would therefore be harmful and out of character. Additional harm would be caused to the areas appearance due to the excessive hard landscaping proposed to the front of the site and the introduction of a three dwelling terrace, which would be visually at odds with the larger terraces and smaller semi detached properties which characterise the area. The proposed dwelling would therefore be detrimental to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the street and wider area. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategi",
    "The existing dwelling would be provided with 2 substandard parking spaces and therefore inadequate parking would be provided for the property. The shortfall in parking is likely to result in roadside parking which would create a more hazardous environment for road users, whilst also causing traffic build up and congestion as vehicles stop to pass parked vehicles. The pedestrian visibility splays shown on the proposed plan are 1.5m by 1.5m and are therefore also substandard. Inadequate splays would reduce the likelihood of vehicle users at the site seeing pedestrians crossing the site. The proposed splays would therefore endanger pedestrians, whilst also creating a more hazardous environment for the sites car users. The submitted vehicle crossover is also substandard. The proposal is therefore considered to result in a more dangerous and hazardous environment for pedestrians and vehicle users of the site. it would also also have an adverse impact on the free flow of traffic on the local",

    "This is a reminder that Under the terms of the Planning Act 2008 (as amended) and Community Infrastructure Levy Regulations 2010 (as amended), should an application for appeal be allowed, the proposed development would be deemed as 'chargeable development' and therefore liable to pay the London Borough of Hillingdon Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and the Mayor of London's Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL).
