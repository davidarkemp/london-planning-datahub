    "Due to its design, isolated position, squat dormers, height and width the proposed dwelling would form an unduly prominent and unsympathetic addition to the street that fails to integrate with the established character of the area. Due to its extensive site coverage and small irregular shaped garden the proposal is also considered to form a cramped overdevelopment of the site. The proposal would therefore be detrimental to the visual amenity and character of the surrounding area,  contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies, Policies DMH 6, DMHB 11, DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policies D1, D3 and D6 of the London Plan (2021), as well as paragraphs 124 and 130 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "Due to its scale and siting in proximity to neighbouring properties the proposed development would harm the outlook from neighbouring gardens on Keith Road and appear overbearing to the detriment of neighbouring residential amenity. The proposal is therefore contrary to  Policy DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and paragraph 130(f) of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The proposed two bedroom property would include no double or twin sized bedrooms. The proposal is therefore considered to be of poor design and it would fail to provide its future occupants with a high quality residential environment, contrary to Policy D6 (2) of the London Plan (2021).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan and national guidance.",
    "This is a reminder that Under the terms of the Planning Act 2008 (as amended) and Community Infrastructure Levy Regulations 2010 (as amended), should an application for appeal be allowed, the proposed development would be deemed as 'chargeable development' and therefore liable to pay the London Borough of Hillingdon Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and the Mayor of London's Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This would be calculated in accordance with the London Borough of Hillingdon CIL Charging Schedule 2014 and the Mayor of London's CIL Charging Schedule 2012.",
