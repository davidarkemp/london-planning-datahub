    "The proposed Covid testing station hereby approved shall be removed from site and the former car parking use of the site re-instated on the 1st of July 2022 or when the facility is no longer required, whichever is the earlier period.",
    "REASON",
    "In order to ensure appropriate staff parking spaces are provided at the airport as demand increases and in order to conform to the terms of the application in accordance with Policies DMAV1 and DMAV2 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 (January 2020) .",

    "Site Location Plan T4 Long Stay Carpark Covid Test Site and Heathrow_T4_Cignpost Rev E; and shall thereafter be retained/maintained for as long as the development remains in existence.",
    "REASON",
    "To ensure the development complies with the provisions Hillingdon Local Plan Parts 1 (November 2012) and 2 (January 2020) and the London Plan (2021).",
    "The development hereby permitted shall not be occupied until the following has been completed in accordance with the specified supporting plans and/or documents:",
    "Heathrow Airport Ltd. Covering Letter dated 7th October 2021",
    "Cignpost Diagnostics - T4 Long Stay ExpressTest Highway Signage ref. 79709 Version No. 4",
    "Thereafter the development shall be retained/maintained in accordance with these details for as long as the development remains in existence.",
    "REASON",
    "To ensure the development complies with the provisions Hillingdon Local Plan Parts 1 (November 2012) and 2 (January 2020) and the London Plan (2021).",
    "Unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority the applicant is required to implement a site wide waste strategy, which must ensure that clinical waste does not mix with other waste streams and all waste is suitably disposed of.",
    "REASON",
    "To ensure that waste and litter is appropriately managed and collected on site, in order to ensure that the use is not detrimental to the visual amenity of the area, in accordance with Policy DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "The decision to GRANT planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to GRANT planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan (2021) and national guidance.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably.",
    "Given the nature of the proposed application, it is possible that a crane may be required during development. We would, therefore, draw the applicant's attention to the requirement within the British Standard Code of Practice for the safe use of Cranes, for crane operators to consult the aerodrome before erecting a crane in close proximity to an aerodrome.  This is explained further in Advice Note 4, 'Cranes' (available at http://www.aoa.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Advice-Note-4-Cranes-2016.pdf)",
