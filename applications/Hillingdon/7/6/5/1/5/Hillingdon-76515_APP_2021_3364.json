    "The proposed extensions, by virtue of its combined scale, height, width and depth alongside the proposed two-storey nature and roof formation, would result in an excessive, visually intrusive, disproportionate, incongruous, dominant, bulky and overbearing form of development that would fail to harmonise with the unique architectural composition of the original dwelling, relationship with the immediate neighbours, visual amenities of the street scene along this section of Woodlands Avenue and the character and appearance of the surrounding area. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012) and Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The proposed extensions, in particular the combined two-storey extensions with the raising of the dwelling height and excessive depth of the rearward projection, would result in harm to the occupiers of 286 and 290 Woodlands Avenue by way of loss of outlook, overbearing impact, overdominance, visual intrusion and loss of daylight/sunlight. As such, the proposal would be contrary to Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2016). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020."
