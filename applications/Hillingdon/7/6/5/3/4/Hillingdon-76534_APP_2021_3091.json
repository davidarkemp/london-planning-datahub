    "The development would involve the conversion of a dwelling with original floor area of under 120 sqm and the development would lead to the loss of a single family dwelling for which there is an established need in the Borough. Adequate family sized housing accommodation would not be re-provided at the site as the proposed ground floor flat would provide inadequate living accommodation for its future occupiers. Furthermore the development would cause harm to the appearance of the area, as well as highway and pedestrian safety. The proposed conversion would therefore be contrary to policy DMH 1 and DMH 4 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "The proposed development includes an excessive amount of parking and is therefore contrary to the Boroughs and Governments aims of promoting sustainable forms of transportation. Due to its multiple vehicle accesses, multiple crossovers and poor parking layout, vehicles entering and exiting the site would have to consider each other, vehicles on the main road, pedestrians coming from both directions on Glebe Road, and a pedestrian in the small island between each of the proposed cross overs. All of which creates a more hazardous environment for pedestrians, site users and road users. Additionally, insufficient information has been submitted to evidence that adequate pedestrian visibility splays could be provided at the site. The absence of the splays would create a more dangerous and hazardous environment for pedestrians using the footpath outside of the site and the sites vehicle users. The proposed development is therefore considered to be detrimental to pedestrian and highway safety,",
    "Insufficient information has been submitted to demonstrate that the proposal would not lead to the loss of the mature tree sited between the front entrances of No.17 and No.19 Glebe Road. The loss of the tree would be harmful to the character and appearance of the locality and the Central Avenue Area of Special Landscape Character. The proposal is therefore considered to be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB5, DMHB11 and DMHB 14 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "Due to the poor design of the proposed development, occupiers of the new ground floor flat would have an inadequate level of privacy or inadequate access to light (when using their front bedroom and kitchen diner). The proposal is therefore considered to provide substandard living accommodation for future residents of Flat 1, contrary to Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021) and paragraph 130 (f) of the NPPF (2021).",
    "Due to to its height, depth and 5m separation distance from No.19, the proposed two storey rear extension would lead to some loss of views and light from the central ground floor habitable room windows of No.19. For the same reasons the proposal would lead to a loss of views from the rear patio of No.19. It would also have an enclosing and overbearing impact on the patio. The identified impacts would cause harm to the amenities of No.19, as they would discourage use of their outdoor space and would adversely impact on their internal living conditions. The proposed development is therefore considered to have a significant adverse impact on the amenities of No.19 Glebe Road. The development would therefore be contrary to Policy DMHB 11 and DMHD1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020) and paragraph 130 (f) of the NPPF (2021).",
    "This is a reminder that Under the terms of the Planning Act 2008 (as amended) and Community Infrastructure Levy Regulations 2010 (as amended), should an application for appeal be allowed, the proposed development would be deemed as 'chargeable development' and therefore liable to pay the London Borough of Hillingdon Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and the Mayor of London's Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This would be calculated in accordance with the London Borough of Hillingdon CIL Charging Schedule 2014 and the Mayor of London's CIL Charging Schedule 2012.",
    "For more information on CIL matters please visit the planning portal page at: www.planningportal.gov.uk/planning/applications/howtoapply/whattosubmit/cil",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2021). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
