    "The proposed installation would increase street clutter along this section of Church Road, resulting in a detrimental impact on the character and appearance of the immediate street scene, the surrounding area and the neighbouring Hayes Village Conservation Area. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies BE4, BE13 and BE37 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Saved UDP Policies (November 2012) and Chapter 10 of the National Planning Policy Framework (March 2012).",
    "The proposed installation would result in a significant reduction in the overall width of the pavement along this section of Church Road, which would restrict the amount of footpath clearance for pedestrians and cause harm to pedestrian safety, contrary to Policy AM7 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Saved UDP Policies (November 2012).",
    "The decision to REFUSE details of siting and design has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE details of siting and design has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Unitary Development Plan Saved Policies (September 2007) as incorporated into the Hillingdon Local Plan (2012) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan - The Spatial Development Strategy for London consolidated with alterations since 2011 (2016) and national guidance."
