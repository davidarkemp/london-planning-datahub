    "The proposed outbuilding, by reason of its siting in an open prominent position, size, scale, bulk and excessive footprint, results in a visually obtrusive form of development, which would be out of character with the pattern of prevailing development in the area to the detriment of the character and appearance of the area. Therefore the proposal is contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies BE13, BE15 and BE19 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Saved UDP Policies (November 2012), the Council's adopted Supplementary Planning Document HDAS: Residential Extensions and Policy DMHD 2 of the Alterations and Extensions to Residential Dwellings of the London Borough Of Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 Development Management Policies with Modifications (March 2019).",
    "The proposed outbuilding, by reason of its size, siting, scale, bulk and excessive footprint, would be detrimental to the amenities of the adjoining occupiers at 73 Turnpike Lane and 16 Amberley Way,  by reason of overdominance, visual intrusion and loss of outlook. Therefore the proposal is contrary to policies BE19 and BE21 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Saved UDP Policies (November 2012), the Council's adopted Supplementary Planning Document HDAS: Residential Extensions  and Policy DMHD 2 of the Alterations and Extensions to Residential Dwellings of the London Borough Of Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 Development Management Policies with Modifications (March 2019).",
    "The proposed outbuilding and hardstanding would, by virtue of its failure to maintain an adequate amount of private usable external amenity space for the occupiers of the existing property, result in over-development of the site detrimental to the residential amenity of of existing and future occupiers. The proposal is therefore contrary to policies BE19 and BE23 of the saved UDP,  the guidance contained within the Hillingdon Design and Accessibility Statement Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Extensions (December 2008) and Policy DMHD 2 of the Alterations and Extensions to Residential Dwellings of the London Borough Of Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 Development Management Policies with Modifications (March 2019).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant saved policies (referred to as policies from the Hillingdon Unitary Development Plan - Saved Policies September 2007), then London Plan Policies (2016).  On the 8th November 2012 Hillingdon's Full Council agreed the adoption of the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies. Appendix 5 of this explains which saved policies from the old Unitary Development (which was subject to a direction from Secretary of State in September 2007 agreeing that the policies were 'saved') still apply for development control decisions.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. The Council's supports pre-application discussions.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
