    "The Lawson Cypress can be seen above the properties in Acacia Avenue and Park Way and between the properties (70 and 72 Acacia Avenue) giving it a Moderate amenity value.  The tree has an attractive crown typical of its species and significantly contributes to the Arboreal character of the area.",
    "An included union is not considered reason enough to remove the tree and the matter could be managed with cobra bracing. No specific technical evidence has been provided with this application to support the reasons to remove.",
    "Having regard to the reasons given for the proposed work, the work is unjustified and will have a detrimental impact on the visual amenity and arboreal character of the area.",
    "The removal of deadwood, dangerous / hanging branches and ivy:  This does not require the formal consent of the Council."
