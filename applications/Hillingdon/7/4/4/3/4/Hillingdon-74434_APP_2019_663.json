    "The proposed single storey side extension, by virtue of the use of a uPVC window in the front elevation, fails to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original dwelling and is detrimental to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the street scene and  fails to either preserve or enhance the character or appearance of the surrounding Harmondsworth Village Conservation Area or the setting of the nearby listed buildings at Harmondsworth Hall and The Grange. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies BE1 and HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies BE4, BE13, BE15 and BE19 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Saved UDP Policies (November 2012), Policy 7.8 of the London Plan (2016) and the NPPF.",
    "The proposal, by reason of the siting of the ground floor flank bedroom window, given its proximity to the side boundary and outbuilding would result in the provision of a habitable room with no outlook and limited levels of natural lighting that would result in a substandard form of living accommodation and reliance upon artificial means of lighting which would fail to satisfy sustainability and energy efficiency objectives and would be to the detriment of the amenity of future occupiers, contrary to Policies 3.5 and 5.3 of the London Plan (March 2016), Policies BE19, BE20 and BE21 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Saved UDP Policies (November 2012) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document HDAS: Residential Extensions.",
    "In order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably. In addition further guidance was offered to the applicant by the case officer during the processing of the application to identify the amendments to address those elements of the scheme considered unacceptable which the applicant chose not to implement."
