Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policies BE1 and HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 1, DMHB 5, DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), Policy 7.8 of the London Plan (2016) and the NPPF.",

Therefore, the proposal would be contrary to Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",

    "The proposal by reason of the loss of the boundary treatment to the frontage with an excessive area of hardstanding, would be detrimental to the visual amenity and character of the area in which it would be set by creating an open parking area and emphasising the appearance of a hard surfaced area.
