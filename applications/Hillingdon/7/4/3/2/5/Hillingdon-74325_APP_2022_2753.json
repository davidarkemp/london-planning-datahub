    "The proposed extensions, in conjunction with the existing side dormer, by reason of their siting, bulk, massing and design, would result in a bulky, disproportionate, incongruous, dominant and overbearing form of development that would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original dwelling, relationship with the attached pair and group value of properties along this part of Long Lane. The proposal would harm the visual amenities of the streetscene and character and appearance of the area. Therefore, the proposal would be contrary to Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021), Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012), Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF).",

Therefore, the proposal would be contrary to Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021), Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012), Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF).",
