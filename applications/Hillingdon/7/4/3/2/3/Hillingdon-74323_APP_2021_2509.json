    "The proposed development, by reason of its siting in a rear garden, layout, site coverage, design and external finish, would result in a visually incongruous form of development given its setting and would fail to harmonise with the existing local and historic context of the surrounding area. The principle of intensifying the residential use of the site, as well as the proposed loss of existing private rear garden area would have a detrimental impact on the character and appearance of the residential area and the wider as a whole. The proposal is, thus, detrimental to the visual amenity and character of the surrounding area and contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two- Development Management Policies (January 2020), Policies D1, D3 and D4 of the London Plan (March 2021) and the  National Planning Policy Framework (July 2021).",
    "The proposed development, by reason of the location, design and layout of the proposed dwelling, the loss of sections of the historic boundary wall and the loss of the existing open garden aspect of the site, would have an unacceptable impact on the character, appearance and setting of the Grade II Listed Building at number 2 Arlington Drive  (known as Little Manor House), thus causing harm to its special interest and significance. The proposal would therefore conflict with the Policies BE1 and HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 1 and DMHB 2  of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two- Development Management Policies (January 2020), Policy HC1 of the London Plan (March 2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (July 2021).",
    "In the absence of an Arboricultural Impact Assessment, Method Statement and Tree Protection Plan, the applicant has failed to demonstrate that the trees at the site will be unaffected by the proposed development and has not made provision for their long term protection. As such, the proposal would be to the detriment of the visual amenities of the street scene and the character and appearance of the surrounding area and contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHB 14 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two- Development Management Policies (January 2020), Policies D1, D3 and G1 of the London Plan (March 2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (July 2021).",

    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan - The Spatial Development Strategy for London consolidated with alterations since 2011 (2016) and national guidance."
