    "The proposed development, by reason of the location, design and layout of the proposed dwelling, the loss of sections of the historic boundary wall and the loss of the existing open garden aspect of the site, would have an unacceptable impact on the character, appearance and setting of the Grade II Listed Building at number 2 Arlington Drive  (known as Little Manor House), thus causing harm to its special interest and significance. The proposal would therefore conflict with the Policies BE1 and HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 1 and DMHB 2  of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two- Development Management Policies (January 2020), Policy HC1 of the London Plan (March 2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (July 2021).",

    "The decision to REFUSE Listed Building Consent has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan - The Spatial Development Strategy for London consolidated with alterations since 2011 (2016) and national guidance."
