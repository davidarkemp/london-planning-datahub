  "description": "Installation of 20m high telecommunications lattice tower accommodating 12 antennas, 4 transmission dishes, 7 ground-based equipment cabinets within a secure, fenced compound and ancillary development thereto (Application under Part 16 of Schedule 2 to the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 2015 (as amended) for determination as to whether prior approval is required for siting and appearance)",
  "epc_number": null,
  "actual_completion_date": null,
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed development, by reason of the siting in this visually prominent position, size, scale, height and design of the proposed  lattice tower and the quantity, size, scale and siting of the equipment cabinets and fenced compound, would create an obtrusive form of development which would add visual clutter to the detriment of the character, appearance and visual amenities of the street scene and the wider area. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHB 21 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies and the NPPF.",
    "The proposed telecommunications installation, by virtue of the location and proximity of the proposed associated concrete base slab close to an existing tree, would result in conflict with the future Root Protection Area (RPA) and canopy spread of the nearby tree, thereby resulting in harm to the appearance and growth of the tree and a detrimental impact on the character and appearance of the immediate and surrounding area, contrary to Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHB 21 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies and the NPPF.",
    "The decision to REFUSE details of siting and design has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE details of siting and design has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan - The Spatial Development Strategy for London consolidated with alterations since 2011 (2016) and national guidance."
