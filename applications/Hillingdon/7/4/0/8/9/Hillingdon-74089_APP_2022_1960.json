    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate that sufficient parking spaces exist (or can be provided) within the development site to satisfactorily accommodate vehicles associated with the development and the site's other use (as a storage facility). The use for which retrospective planning permission is sought has resulted in parking stress and associated congestion to the detriment of pedestrian and highway safety, as well as the amenities of local residents and these issues cannot be satisfactorily resolved through the use of planning conditions. The development is therefore contrary to Policies DMT 1, DMT 2, DMT 4 and DMT 6 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy T4 and T6 of the London Plan (2021) and paragraphs 111 and 130 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan (2021) and national guidance."
