    "The proposed development by reason of its siting, size, scale, bulk, massing and design would result in a oversized, incongruous and unduly prominent form of development. Consequently, the proposed development would be detrimental to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area. Additionally, the proposed car park would form a isolated and uncharacteristic addition to the street scene, causing further harm to its appearance. The proposal would therefore be contrary Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012), Policies DMH 6, DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two- Development Management Policies (2020), Policies D1, D3, D4 and D8 of the London Plan (2021) and Chapter 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The proposed development, by virtue of its proximity, size, scale, height and design layout would be detrimental to the residential amenities of the neighbouring occupiers at 32A Pole Hill Court (a block of flats consisting of 5 apartments) in terms of loss of light, outlook, overshadowing, overlooking, privacy, sense of enclosure and overbearing effect. It would also cause signficant overlooking and a loss of privacy to the garden of No.30 Pole Hill Road, adversely impacting on that neighbours amenities and discouraging use of their external amenity space. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012), Policy DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two- Development Management Policies (2020) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The proposal includes no provision of family sized residential units (3 bedrooms or more) and would result in the loss of a family sized residential unit. The proposal therefore consists of a unsuitable housing mix which would also unacceptably undermine the supply of family housing within the Borough, contrary to Policies DMH 1, DMH 2 and DMH 4 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy H10 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The future occupiers of Flats 5 and 6 would be sited in close proximity to the proposed communal balcony and balcony of Flat 7. Unrestricted use of those balconies is likely give rise to unacceptable levels of noise causing disruption and disturbance to the amenities of the mentioned future occupiers. The proposal would therefore be contrary to paragraph 130 (f) of the NPPF (2021) which seeks to ensure that development provides a high standard of amenity for its existing and future users as well as contrary to Policies DMHB 16 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan (2021).",
    "This is a reminder that Under the terms of the Planning Act 2008 (as amended) and Community Infrastructure Levy Regulations 2010 (as amended), should an application for appeal be allowed, the proposed development would be deemed as 'chargeable development' and therefore liable to pay the London Borough of Hillingdon Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and the Mayor of London's Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This would be calculated in accordance with the London Borough of Hillingdon CIL Charging Schedule 2014 and the Mayor of London's CIL Charging Schedule 2012.",
