    "Given the nature of the proposed development it is possible that a crane may be required during its construction.  The applicant's attention is drawn to the requirement within the British Standard Code of Practice for the safe use of Cranes, for crane operators to consult the aerodrome before erecting a crane in close proximity to an aerodrome.  This is explained further in Advice Note 4, 'Cranes and Other Construction Issues' (available at www.aoa.org.uk/publications/safeguarding.asp)",
    "Wind Turbines can impact on the safe operation of aircraft through interference with aviation radar and/or due to their height. Any proposal that incorporates wind turbines must be assessed in more detail to determine the potential impacts on aviation interests.  This is explained further in Advice Note 7, 'Wind Turbines and Aviation' available at http://www.aoa.org.uk/policy-campaigns/operations-safety/",
    "The development requires the formation of a vehicular crossover, which will be constructed by the Council.  This work is also subject to the issuing of a separate licence to obstruct or open up the public highway.  For further information and advice contact: - Highways Maintenance Operations, 4W/07, Civic Centre, Uxbridge, UB8 1UW.",
    "Prior to work commencing, you are advised to submit an application for a Heavy Duty Vehicle Crossover to Highways Maintenance, 4W/07, Civic Centre, Uxbridge, UB8 1UW to prevent damage to the highway from construction vehicles entering and leaving the site."
