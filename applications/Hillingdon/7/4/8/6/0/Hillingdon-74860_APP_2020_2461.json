  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed development as it relates to the ground floor side/rear extension by reason of its design in terms of depth along the shared boundary with No.136 would result in closing the existing gap. It is considered that the development proposed would be detrimental to the residential amenity of adjoining neighbour in terms of over-dominance, overshadowing, visual intrusion, loss of light and loss of outlook. Therefore the proposal would not be contrary to Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies.",
    "The proposal by reason of the ground floor side extension closing up the existing gap and not be setback from the shared boundary, would fail to respect the character of the existing building and fail to harmonise with the scale, form and proportions of the original building and adjacent buildings. As such, the proposal will have adverse cumulative impact on the character, appearance and quality of the existing street or wider area. The proposal, therefore, would not accord with Policy DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies."
