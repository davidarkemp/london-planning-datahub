    "The proposed development as it relates to the ground floor rear extension by reason of its design in terms of depth along the shared boundary would significantly harm the residential amenity of the neighbouring property at No.136 and would fail to adhere to 45 degree line of sight. Therefore, the proposal would fail to accord with policy DMHD1 of the Local Plan Part 2 - Development Management Policies: October 2015, Policy BE20 of the Hillingdon Local Plan (November 2012) and HDAS: Residential Extensions.",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant saved policies (referred to as policies from the Hillingdon Unitary Development Plan - Saved Policies September 2007), then London Plan Policies (2016).  On the 8th November 2012 Hillingdon's Full Council agreed the adoption of the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies. Appendix 5 of this explains which saved policies from the old Unitary Development (which was subject to a direction from Secretary of State in September 2007 agreeing that the policies were 'saved') still apply for development control decisions.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the 'Saved' UDP 2007, Local Plan Part 1, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service."
