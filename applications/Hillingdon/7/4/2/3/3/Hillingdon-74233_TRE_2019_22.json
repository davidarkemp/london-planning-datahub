    "The Austrian Pine is situated in the rear garden of the property at the far end, on the eastern boundary. The tree does not appear to have been pruned (reduced) before and, as a result, has retained an attractive, natural looking crown, typical of this species. The tree is highly visible and has a high amenity value.",

It would unnecessarily introduce multiple wounds into the crown of this tree which would likely lead to infection. Additionally, the proposed work would reduce the size and amenity value of this tree, and would be detrimental to the natural appearance of this tree.",
