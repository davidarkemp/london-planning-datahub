    "The proposed single storey rear extension by reason of design, scale and massing would have a harmful impact on the character and appearance of the host dwelling insofar that it would constitute discordant addition due to its excess depth beyond the original rear building line of the property leading to a disproportionate development as a whole which creates detrimental impact on the visual amenity and character of the terraced formation and the surrounding residential area. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy D4 of the London Plan (2021),  Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan (Part 1) (2012), Policies DMHD 1 and DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan (Part 2) (2020) and the National Planning Policy Framework 2023.",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan - The Spatial Development Strategy for London consolidated with alterations since 2011 (2016) and national guidance."
