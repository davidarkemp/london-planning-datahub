  "description": "Conversion of roofspace to habitable use involving raising of ridge height and a front and a rear dormer",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed roof extensions, by reason of the size, scale, bulk, height and design of the rear dormer and the increase in the height of the roof, would result in dominant and incongruous additions which would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original dwelling and would be detrimental to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the street scene, the setting of the adjoining Harlington Village Conservation Area and the Grade II Listed Buildings and the surrounding area. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 1, DMHB 2, DMHB 4, DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant policies (referred to as policies from the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and then London Plan Policies (2016).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service. We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
