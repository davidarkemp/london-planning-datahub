    "The outbuilding, by reason of its size, scale, results in a visually obtrusive form of development, which is out of character with the pattern of prevailing development in the area to the detriment of the character and appearance of the area. Therefore the proposal is contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies BE13, BE15 and BE19 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Saved UDP Policies (November 2012) and the Council's adopted Supplementary Planning Document HDAS: Residential Extensions.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. The Council's supports pre-application discussions which the applicant did not seek before submission of the application. The LPA have taken the personal reasons of the applicant on board, however the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
