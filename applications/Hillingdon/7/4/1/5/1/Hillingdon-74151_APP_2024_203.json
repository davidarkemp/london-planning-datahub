    "The proposed development, by reason of its siting and layout would result in a development of the site, which would fail to harmonise with the established local context of the surrounding area. The principle of intensifying the residential use of the site as proposed, as well as the proposed loss of existing private rear garden area would have a detrimental impact on the street scene and character and appearance of the area as a whole. The proposal is therefore detrimental to the visual amenity and character of the surrounding area and contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMH 6, DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the adopted Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021), and Paragraphs 130 and 131 of the NPPF (2023).",
    "The proposed development, by reason of its siting, size, scale and discordant design, including its poor roof form and its proximity to the highway, would fail to harmonise with the character and architectural composition of surrounding properties, appearing as an awkward, incongruous and cramped form of development which would be detrimental to the visual amenity of the street scene and harmful to the character and appearance of the surrounding area, contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the of the adopted Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020) and Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan - The Spatial Development Strategy for London consolidated with alterations since 2011 (2016) and national guidance."
