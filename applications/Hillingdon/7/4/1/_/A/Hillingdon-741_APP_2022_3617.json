    "The proposed two-storey side and rear extension, front extension and roof extension including the substantial increase in ridge height, by reason of its siting, size, height, scale, bulk, and design would fail to appear as a subordinate addition and would result in an incongruous addition which would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original dwelling, and would be detrimental to the character and appearance of the  Hillingdon Court Park Area of Special Local Character. The proposal is therefore contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies Policy DMHB 5, DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021) and Chapter 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The proposed two-storey side and rear extension, front extension and roof extension including the increase in ridge height, by reason of its proximity, depth, scale, bulk, and height would have a harmful impact on the living conditions of the occupiers of No. 179A and No. 189 Long Lane and their associated privacy amenity space, in terms of loss of outlook, overdominance, loss of privacy, sense of enclosure and overbearing impact. The proposal would therefore be contrary to  to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11, and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The site forms part of an area covered by Tree Preservation Area TPO 161. In the absence of a tree report and arboricultural impact assessment to BS5837:2012, it has not been demonstrated that the trees will be unaffected by the development and provision has not been made for their long term protection. For these reasons, the proposal would conflict with Policies DMHB 14 and DMHD 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policies G1 and G7 of the London Plan (2021) and Chapter 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2021). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020."
