  "description": "Installation of rear dormer, enlargement of existing dormer and raising of dummy pitched roof of existing side extension",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed rear dormer and enlargement of the existing dormer, by virtue of their size, scale, bulk and design, would result in an incongruous addition to the existing dwellinghouse which would be detrimental to the architectural composition of the existing building, the street scene and would harm the character and appearance of the wider area. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two: Development Management Policies (January 2020)",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service. We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
