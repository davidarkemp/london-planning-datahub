    "The proposed development, by reason of the size, design and siting of the proposed monopole and the quantity, size, scale and siting of the equipment cabinets, would create an obtrusive form of development which would add visual clutter to the street scene and the new emerging townscape of Hayes Town Centre. The proposed mast location site is prominently situated in an important gateway location to the town centre, which is very close to a new Crossrail station and where there is significant investment occuring to improve the character and appearance of the wider streetscene. It is considered that the proposal is sited in a very inappropriate location which would result in a significant detrimental impact on the appearance of the wider streetscene. As such, the proposal would be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies BE13, BE19 and BE37 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Saved UDP Policies (November 2012) and P",
