    "The proposed extension, by virtue of its failure to maintain an adequate amount of private usable external amenity space for the occupiers of the extended property, would result in an over-development of the site detrimental to the residential amenity of existing and future occupiers. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies BE19 and BE23 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Unitary Development Plan Saved Policies (November 2012) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document HDAS: Residential Extensions.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. The Council's supports pre-application discussions which was not taken, however we have been unable to seek solutions arising from the application as the principal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and as the existing extensions and alterations fail to meet the required minimum garden area, any reduction to the number of sheds would continue to fail to overcome the reason for refusal."
