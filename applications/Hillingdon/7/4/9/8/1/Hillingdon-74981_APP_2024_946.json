    "The proposed development, by reason of siting, size, building configuration and layout, would disrupt the established building line along the streetscape and would therefore be at odds with the surrounding area's urban grain. As such, the development would be an incongruous form of development when compared with the existing pattern of development around the context of the site leading to a cramped form of development that would fail to harmonise with the surrounding area and distinctiveness of the streetscape in terms of contextual design and building alignment. The development is therefore harmful to the visual amenity and character of the surrounding area and contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020) and Policies D1, D3, D4 and H10 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "The proposed development would provide an inadequate standard of residential accommodation and would fail to deliver an acceptable living environment for future occupiers, with regards to privacy and visual outlook. As such, the development would represent a cramped and substandard form of residential accommodation detrimental to the residential amenity of future residents and would be contrary to Policies DMHB 11 and DMHB 18 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020) and Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021).",

    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan - The Spatial Development Strategy for London consolidated with alterations since 2011 (2016) and national guidance."
