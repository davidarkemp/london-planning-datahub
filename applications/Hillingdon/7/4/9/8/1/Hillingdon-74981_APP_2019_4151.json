  "description": "Erection of 1-bed bungalow with associated cycle and bin storage and amenity space, involving demolition of existing garages",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed development, by reason of its siting, size, scale, bulk and layout would result in a cramped form of development, which would fail to harmonise with the existing local and historic context of the surrounding area. The principle of intensifying the residential use of the site as proposed would have a detrimental impact on the street scene and character and appearance of the area as a whole. The proposal is therefore detrimental to the visual amenity and character of the surrounding area and contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020) and the NPPF.",
    "The proposed development by virtue of its size, scale, bulk, height and proximity, would be detrimental to the amenities of the adjoining occupiers at 1 and 2 Ashburton Court by reason of overdominance, visual intrusion and loss of outlook. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policy DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "The proposal would exacerbate local parking stress due to the insufficient parking provision, leading to on-street parking/queuing to the detriment of public and highway safety and contrary to policies DMT 2 and DMT 6 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020) and to Hillingdon's Adopted Parking Standards as set out in Appendix C of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "The proposed development, by virtue of its failure to provide amenity space of sufficient size and quality commensurate to the size and layout of the said unit would result in an over-development of the site detrimental to the residential amenity of existing and future occupiers. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy DMHB 18 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan - The Spatial Development Strategy for London consolidated with alterations since 2011 (2016) and national guidance.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the 'Saved' UDP 2007, Local Plan Part 1, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service."
