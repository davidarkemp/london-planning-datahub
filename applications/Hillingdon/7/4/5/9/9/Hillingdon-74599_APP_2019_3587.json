    "The proposal, by reason of the loss of a retail unit within the secondary shopping area of the Eastcote Town Centre and the use proposed, would erode the retail function of the area, harming the vitality and viability of the centre. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy DMTC 2 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two Development Management Policies (March 2019) and Policies 2.15 and 4.9 of the London Plan (2016).",

The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies BE1 and HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 1, DMHB 4 and DMHB 13 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies (March 2019) Policy 7.8 of the London Plan (2016) and the NPPF.",
