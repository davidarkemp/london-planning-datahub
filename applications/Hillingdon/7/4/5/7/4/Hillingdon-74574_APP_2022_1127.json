    "The proposed amendments would substantially change the appearance of the proposed development when compared to how it was originally granted under planning permission 74574/APP/2019/431 (which was allowed at Appeal by the Secretary of State, Appeal reference APP/R5510/W/20/3250274 dated 14th August 2020). The proposed changes constitute a material amendment for which planning permission is required.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "a) We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
