  "description": "Single storey side/rear extension and first floor rear extension",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposal, by reason of the size, scale, bulk, siting and fenestration of the single storey side/rear extension and the siting of a rear rooflight on the first floor rear extension on this open prominent site, would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original dwelling, would be detrimental to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the street scene and would fail to either preserve or enhance the character or appearance of the surrounding Ickenham Village Conservation Area. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies BE1 and HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies BE4, BE13, BE15 and BE19 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Saved UDP Policies (November 2012), Policy 7.8 of the London Plan (2016), the adopted Supplementary Planning Document HDAS: Residential Extensions and the NPPF.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the 'Saved' UDP 2007, Local Plan Part 1, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service. No pre-application advice was sought and the applicant would have been aware of the previous reasons for refusal."
