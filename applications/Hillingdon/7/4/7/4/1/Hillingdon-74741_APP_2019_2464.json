    "The proposed front porch, by reason of its siting, size, scale, bulk and design would result in an incongruous and overly dominant addition which would be detrimental to the architectural composition of the existing building, the street scene, and would harm the character and appearance of the the Ickenham Village Conservation Area. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policy BE1, HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies BE4, BE13, BE15 and BE19 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Saved UDP Policies (November 2012) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document HDAS: Residential Extensions.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the 'Saved' UDP 2007, Local Plan Part 1, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.  No pre-application advice was sought and the applicant would have been aware of the previous reasons for refusal.",
    "The applicant is advised that the existing plan (20MC-2-01) shows a storm porch / canopy roof to the front of the property's entrance beneath which the proposed porch was to be built but no such canopy exists on site."
