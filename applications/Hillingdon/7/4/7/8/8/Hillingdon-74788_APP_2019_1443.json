    "The application site falls within flood zone 2 and as such is located in a high risk location. Paragraph 155 of the NPPF requires new development to be directed to areas at the lowest probability of flooding by applying a sequential test. In this instance neither a sequential or exception test has been provided and the application has failed to provide any evidence of a site search demonstrating that this is the only suitable site for development, and as such, it has not passed the sequential test. The application has not demonstrated a clear justification for developing this area ahead of sites at a lower risk of flooding, whilst putting people and property at risk of flooding. The proposal is therefore considered unacceptable and contrary to the objectives of Policy EM6 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies OE7 and OE8 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Saved UDP Policies (November 2012), Policy 5.12 of the London Plan (2016) and",
    "It has not been demonstrated that a proposed development for up to 9 units on a plot of a very limited size could achieve adequate access, car parking or amenity space.  Such a development would result in a visually intrusive and cramped appearance that would be out of character with the pattern of development in the area. Therefore the proposal is contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies AM14, BE13, BE19 and BE23 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Saved UDP Policies (November 2012), Policies 3.5 and 7.4 of the London Plan (2016) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document HDAS: Residential Layouts.",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Unitary Development Plan Saved Policies (September 2007) as incorporated into the Hillingdon Local Plan (2012) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan - The Spatial Development Strategy for London consolidated with alterations since 2011 (2016) and national guidance.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the 'Saved' UDP 2007, Local Plan Part 1, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service. The application form highlights that the applicant choose not to obtain any pre-application advice."
