    "The development hereby permitted shall be begun before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.",

    "The development hereby permitted shall not be carried out except in complete accordance with the details shown on the submitted plans, numbers Proposed Plan and shall thereafter be retained/maintained for as long as the development remains in existence.",
    "REASON",
    "To ensure the development complies with the provisions Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two Saved UDP Policies (November 2012), Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2- Development Management Polices with Modifications (March 2019) and the London Plan (2016).",
    "The materials to be used in the construction of the external surfaces of the development hereby permitted shall match those used in the existing building and shall thereafter be retained as such.",
    "REASON",
    "To safeguard the visual amenities of the area and to ensure that the proposed development does not have an adverse effect upon the appearance of the existing building in accordance with Policy BE15 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two Saved UDP Policies (November 2012) and policy DMHB11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2- Development Management Polices with Modifications (March 2019).",
    "The premises shall be used for a physiotherapy clinic (D1) and a yoga studio (D2) and for no other purpose (including any other purpose in Class D1 or D2 of the Schedule to the Town and Country Planning (Use Classes) Order 1987).",
    "REASON",
    "To ensure that the impact of other uses within the D1 and D2 use class on traffic and adjoining occupiers is considered in accordance with the Policies of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two Saved UDP Policies (November 2012).",
    "The decision to GRANT planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to GRANT planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Unitary Development Plan Saved Policies (September 2007) as incorporated into the Hillingdon Local Plan (2012) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan - The Spatial Development Strategy for London consolidated with alterations since 2011 (2016) and national guidance.",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant saved policies (referred to as policies from the Hillingdon Unitary Development Plan - Saved Policies September 2007), then London Plan Policies (2016).  On the 8th November 2012 Hillingdon's Full Council agreed the adoption of the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies. Appendix 5 of this explains which saved policies from the old Unitary Development (which was subject to a direction from Secretary of State in September 2007 agreeing that the policies were 'saved') still apply for development control decisions.",
    "The Equality Act 2010 seeks to protect people accessing goods, facilities and services from discrimination on the basis of a 'protected characteristic', which includes those with a disability. As part of the Act, service providers are obliged to improve access to and within the structure of their building, particularly in situations where reasonable adjustment can be incorporated with relative ease. The Act states that service providers should think ahead to take steps to address barriers that impede disabled people."
