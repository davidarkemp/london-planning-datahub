    "The proposed extension, by reason of its size, scale, depth, width and proximity to the front boundary, in this open prominent position, would result in an insubordinate and inharmonious addition to the original property that fails to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original dwelling and results in the closing of an important gap characteristic to the area, resulting in a cramped appearance and significant reduction of the landscaped front garden. The proposal would therefore appear as a visually incongruous development, that erodes the landscaping of the area and represents an overdevelopment of the site, to the detriment of the visual amenities of the street scene and the character and appearance of the surrounding area. The proposed development is therefore contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Polic",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
