    "The proposed development, by virtue of its failure to provide amenity space of sufficient size and quality commensurate to the size and layout of the said units would result in an over-development of the site detrimental to the residential amenity of future occupiers. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies BE19 and BE23 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Unitary Development Plan Saved Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 11 and DMHB 18 of the emerging Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies with Modifications (March 2019) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document HDAS: Residential Layouts.",
    "The proposed development results in the frontage being totally hardstanding with no space available to provide soft landscaping to the detriment of the visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area. The proposal is therefore contrary to to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies BE13, BE19 and BE38 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Unitary Development Plan Saved Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the emerging Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies with Modifications (March 2019) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document HDAS: Residential Layouts.",

    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Unitary Development Plan Saved Policies (September 2007) as incorporated into the Hillingdon Local Plan (2012) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan - The Spatial Development Strategy for London consolidated with alterations since 2011 (2016) and national guidance.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. The Council's supports pre-application discussions however we have been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal"
