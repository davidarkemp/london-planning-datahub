  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed extension by reason of its overall size, height, bulk and design, in conjunction with loft extension and rear single storey rear extension, would fail to appear subordinate to the original property and terrace of which it forms part,  giving rise to a cramped form of development, which would be detrimental to the visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area generally. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), policies DMHB11; DMHB12 and DMHD1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan - Part One (2020) and policies D3 and D8 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "The proposed first floor rear extension, by reason of its depth, design and proximity to the boundary, in combination with the existing extensions, would be detrimental to the residential amenities of the adjoining occupier at No.121 Cleave Avenue by reason of overdominance, overshadowing and visual intrusion, and loss of outlook. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policies DMHB11 and DMHD1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan - Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020)."
