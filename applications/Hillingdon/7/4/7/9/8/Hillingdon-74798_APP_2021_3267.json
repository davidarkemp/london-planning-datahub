    "The proposed single storey rear extension, by reason of its depth, design and proximity to the boundary, would be detrimental to the residential amenities of the adjoining occupier at No.121 Cleave Avenue by reason of overdominance, overshadowing, visual intrusion, loss of light and loss of outlook. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policies DMHB11 and DMHD1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan - Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The proposed development has failed to demonstrate that it would provide an adequate level of outlook and natural light for the kitchen area at the application property. The proposal would therefore give rise to a substandard form of living accommodation to the detriment of the amenities of future occupants of the application property contrary to the requirements of Policy DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies and Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
