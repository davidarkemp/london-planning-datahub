    "he proposed side/rear extension by reason of its size, scale, bulk, height, depth, proximity to the side boundary and projection forward of the return building line along Heathfield Rise, in this open prominent position, would result in the closing of an important gap characteristic to the area, resulting in a cramped appearance. The proposal would therefore represent an overdevelopment of the site to the detriment of the visual amenities of the street scene and the character and appearance of the surrounding area. The proposed development is therefore contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHD 1 and DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "In the absence of a Tree Survey and Arboricultural Implication Assessment to BS5837:2012 standards, the application has failed to demonstrate that the development will safeguard the existing street tree adjoining the site and fails to demonstrate the long-term retention of the tree. The proposal would therefore be detrimental to the visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area generally, contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11 and DMHB 14 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "Due to the insufficient width of the crossover at kerbline of Heathfield Rise that would be required to access the proposed parking space at rear garden, the proposal would make inadequate provision for pedestrian refuge and would therefore prejudice the safety of pedestrians and vehicles using the highway. As a result it would be contrary to policy DMT 2 and DMT 6 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the 'Saved' UDP 2007, Local Plan Part 1, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.  No pre-application advice was sought.   However the applicant would have been aware of the previous reasons for refusal."
