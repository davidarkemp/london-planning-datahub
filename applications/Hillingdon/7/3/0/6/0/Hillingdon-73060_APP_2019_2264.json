    "The proposed development, by reason of its size, scale, bulk and design, would represent a visually unsympathetic form of development, which would detract from the character, appearance and visual amenity of the street scene and the wider Copsewood Estate Area of Special Local Character. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policies BE1 and HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies BE5, BE6, BE13 and BE19 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Saved UDP Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 1, DMHB 5, DMHB 6, DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the emerging Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies with Modifications (March 2019), Policies 3.5 and 7.4 of the London Plan (March 2016) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document HDAS: Residential Layouts.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the 'Saved' UDP 2007, Local Plan Part 1, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.  No pre-application advice was sought.   However the applicant would have been aware of the previous reasons for refusal."
