    "The proposal by reason of its excessive scale, design, siting and tree removal would result in an over development of the site which fails to read as a subordinate addition to the host property, harming the appearance of the original dwelling, the visual amenity of the street scene and character of the area. It would also fail to preserve or enhance the setting of the adjacent Grade II listed buildings, resulting in less than substantial harm which would not be outweighed by any public benefits. Therefore it is recommended that the application is refused contrary toHE1 and BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One Strategic (2012) and Policies DMHB1, DMHB 4, DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policies D3, G1, G7 and HC1 of the London Plan (2021) and Chapters 12 and 16 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2016). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020."
