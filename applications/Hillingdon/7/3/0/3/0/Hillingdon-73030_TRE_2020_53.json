This tree is visible from all sides and is highly visible from the west, making a good contribution to the visual amenity and arboreal character of the local area. It is also an important member of a group of trees in a row - aiding cohesion.",

It would unnecessarily introduce multiple pruning wounds to this tree which would likely lead to infection and would also affect the natural appearance and structure of the crown. Therefore, the proposed work would reduce the amenity value of this tree and this would result in a detrimental impact on its natural appearance.
