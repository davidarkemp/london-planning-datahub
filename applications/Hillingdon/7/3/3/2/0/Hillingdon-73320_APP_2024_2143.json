    "The proposed development, by reason of its increased ridge height and the external staircase, would result in an incongruous and visually discordant addition that fails to respect the design, proportions, and character of the original building. The proposal would appear as an overdevelopment of the site, detracting from the character and appearance of the local area and Northwood Area of Special Local Character. The proposal therefore conflicts with Policies BE1 and HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012), Policies DMHB 1, DMHB 11, DMHB 12, and DMHB 14 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021), and the NPPF (2023).",
    "The proposed bin and cycle store are shown to be located partially outside the application site red line boundary, which raises concerns about land ownership and the ability to secure long-term provision and maintenance of these facilities. Policy DMHB 14 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021) require that developments provide adequate and conveniently located facilities for refuse and cycle storage within the site boundaries. The proposal, as submitted, fails to meet these requirements and would result in a scheme that does not ensure proper provision for waste management and sustainable transport. As such, the proposal would fail to comply with Policy DMHB 14 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan (2021) and national guidance.",
    "This is a reminder that Under the terms of the Planning Act 2008 (as amended) and Community Infrastructure Levy Regulations 2010 (as amended), should an application for appeal be allowed, the proposed development would be deemed as 'chargeable development' and therefore liable to pay the London Borough of Hillingdon Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and the Mayor of London's Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This would be calculated in accordance with the London Borough of Hillingdon CIL Charging Schedule 2014 and the Mayor of London's CIL Charging Schedule 2012.",
