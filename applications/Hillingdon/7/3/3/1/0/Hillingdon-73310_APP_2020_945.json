  "decision_conditions": [
    "The extension, by reason of its, siting in a visually prominent position, overall size, scale, depth and bulk, in conjunction with existing extensions, is considered to result in an extension which would not be subordinate to the original property, would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original dwelling and would be detrimental to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "The single storey rear conservatory, by virtue of its size, scale, bulk and depth is detrimental to the amenities of the adjoining occupier at 75 Mildred Avenue, by reason of overdominance, visual intrusion and loss of outlook. Therefore, the proposal would be contrary to policies DMHD 1 and DMHB 11 of the adopted Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the 'Saved' UDP 2007, Local Plan Part 1, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service."
