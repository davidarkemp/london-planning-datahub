    "The proposed two storey side extension, by reason of it siting in this open prominent position, size, scale and bulk, would result in the loss of a substantial proportion of an important gap, characteristic to the area, resulting in a cramped appearance, and would be detrimental to the visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area. The proposal would therefore represent an overdevelopment of the site to the detriment of the character and the visual amenities of the area and to this existing open area of the street scene which lies within the Metropolitan Green Belt. Therefore the proposal is contrary to the advice contained within the NPPF, Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies OL1,  BE13, BE15 and BE19 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Saved UDP Policies (November 2012).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant saved policies (referred to as policies from the Hillingdon Unitary Development Plan - Saved Policies September 2007), then London Plan Policies (2016).  On the 8th November 2012 Hillingdon's Full Council agreed the adoption of the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies. Appendix 5 of this explains which saved policies from the old Unitary Development (which was subject to a direction from Secretary of State in September 2007 agreeing that the policies were 'saved') still apply for development control decisions.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. The Council's supports pre-application discussions.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
