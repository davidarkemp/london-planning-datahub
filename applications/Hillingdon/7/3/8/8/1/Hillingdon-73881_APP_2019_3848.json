    "The proposed development, by reason of its poor internal and external layout, design, with a single aspect outlook for future occupiers to the service access and car parking, would result in a cramped over development of the site which would be detrimental to the to the residential amenities of the future occupiers. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policy DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two-Development Plan Policies (2020) and Policy 3.5 of the London Plan (2016).",
    "The proposal would provide an indoor living area of an unsatisfactory size and quality for the future occupiers of the proposed units and would therefore give rise to a substandard form of living accommodation to the detriment of the amenity of future occupiers. The proposal is thus contrary to Policy 3.5 and Table 3.3 of the London Plan (2016), the Housing Standards Minor Alterations to The London Plan (March 2016), the Mayor of London's adopted Supplementary Planning Guidance - Housing (March 2016) and the Technical Housing Standards - Nationally Described Space Standard (March 2015).",
    "The proposed development, by reason of its poor internal layout with poor levels of light and no outlook particularly with respect to the second bedroom in each proposed unit, would result in a substandard and poor quality form of development, harmful to the residential amenity of future occupants. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policy DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two-Development Plan Policies (2020) and Policy 3.5 of the London Plan (2016).",
    "The proposed development, by virtue of its failure to provide amenity space of sufficient size and quality commensurate to the size and layout of the said units would result in an over-development of the site detrimental to the residential amenity of future occupiers. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy DMHB 18 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two- Development Plan Policies (2020).",
    "The development would result in the unacceptable loss of a viable employment generating use to a residential use that would not be compatible with the characteristics of the site and the adjoining employment generating uses. As such it is considered that the proposed development would  give rise to general noise and disturbance harmful to the amenity of future residents. The proposal is therefore contrary to policies DME 2 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two- Development Plan Policies (2020) and Policy 3.5 of the London Plan (2016).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 policies, then London Plan Policies (2016).  On the 8th November 2012 Hillingdon's Full Council agreed the adoption of the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies. Appendix 5 of this explains which saved policies from the old Unitary Development (which was subject to a direction from Secretary of State in September 2007 agreeing that the policies were 'saved') still apply for development control decisions."
