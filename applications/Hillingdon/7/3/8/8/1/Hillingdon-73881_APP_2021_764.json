The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policy DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two-Development Plan Policies (2020) and Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "The proposed development, by virtue of its failure to provide amenity space of sufficient size and quality commensurate to the size and layout of the said units would result in an over-development of the site detrimental to the residential amenity of future occupiers. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy DMHB 18 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two- Development Plan Policies (2020).",
