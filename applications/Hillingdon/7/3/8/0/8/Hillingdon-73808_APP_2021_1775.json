    "The two storey side extension, by reason of its siting in this open prominent position, size, scale, design, proximity to the side boundary and projection forward of the return building line along Pinkwell Avenue, would result in the loss of an important gap characteristic to the area, resulting in a cramped appearance. The proposal would therefore represent an overdevelopment of the site to the detriment of the visual amenities of the street scene and the character and appearance of the surrounding area. The proposed development is therefore contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB11 and DMHD1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan - Part Two (2020) and Policies D4 and D8 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "The proposed part two storey, part single storey rear extension, in combination with the proposed two storey side extension and existing roof extensions to include a hip to gable and rear dormer, would englulf and subsume the original dwelling, failing to appear subordinate or respecting its architectural integrity. As such the proposal would represent an incongruous form of development  to the detriment of the visual amenities of the street scene and the character and appearance of the surrounding area. The proposed development is therefore contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB11 and DMHD1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan - Part Two (2020) and Policies D4 and D8 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service."
