  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed development, by reason of its siting (in a rear garden), design, layout, and site coverage, would result in a cramped development of the site, which is visually incongruous (given the setting) and would fail to harmonise with the existing local and historic context of the surrounding area. The principle of intensifying the residential use of the site, as well as the proposed loss of existing private rear garden area would have a detrimental impact on the character, appearance and visual amenity of the street scene and the surrounding area, contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies BE13, BE19 and H12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Saved UDP Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 6, DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the emerging Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies with Modifications (March 2019), Policies 3.5, 7.1 and 7.4 of the London Plan (2016), guidance within The London Plan",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. The Council's supports pre-application discussions.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
