    "The single storey side extension, by reason of its siting in this open prominent position, size, scale, design, proximity to the side boundary and projection forward of the return building line along Pinkwell Avenue, would result in the loss of an important gap characteristic to the area, resulting in a cramped appearance to the detriment of the visual amenities of the street scene and the character and appearance of the surrounding area. The proposed development is therefore contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB11 and DMHD1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan - Part Two (2020) and Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021) and Chapter  12 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the 'Saved' UDP 2007, Local Plan Part 1, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service. This is a resubmission of a previously refused scheme, where the Officers Report identified issues to be addressed, which were reflected in the reasons for refusal, allowing the opportunity to address those issues within this submission."
