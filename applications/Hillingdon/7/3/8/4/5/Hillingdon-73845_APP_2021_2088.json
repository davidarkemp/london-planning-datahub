    "The proposed development, by reason of its size, scale, bulk and roof design which include side facing dormers, fails to harmonise with the established local context, to the detriment of the character, appearance and visual amenities of the street scene and the wider area. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policy DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020) and Policies D3 and D6 of the London Plan (March 2021).",
    "The proposal has not demonstrated that the development would be accessible, giving rise to a substandard form of living accommodation to the detriment of the amenity of future occupiers. The proposal is thus contrary to Policy DMHB 11 of the adopted Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020) and Policies D5 and D7 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "The proposal, by reason of the siting of the ground floor flank bedroom window of Flat 2 and the rear bedroom window of Flat 1, given their proximity to the side boundary, fence and wall of the proposed building, would result in the provision of habitable rooms with very limited levels of natural lighting and outlook, that would result in a substandard form of living accommodation and reliance upon artificial means of lighting which would fail to satisfy sustainability and energy efficiency objectives and would be to the detriment of the amenity of future occupiers, contrary to Policies DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and Policies D6 and SI2 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "The provision of 4 on-site car parking spaces (except for disabled parking) for a development site that has a PTAL 5 rating is contrary to the zero maximum parking standard set out in Policy T6 of the adopted London Plan (2021) and the applicant has failed to demonstrate a satisfactory policy-led approach to the provision and layout of the cycle parking facility contrary to Policy T5 of the London Plan  and Policy DMT 6 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "Due to the proposed siting of the off street parking bays, the proposal would result in a large area of hardstanding/parking on the frontage, and would not allow sufficient space to mitigate this impact by way of soft landscaping. The proposal would therefore be detrimental to the visual amenities of the street scene and character and appearance of the wider area, contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan (November 2012), Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHB 14 of the Hillingdon Local Plan - Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and Policies D4 and D8 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan (2021) and national guidance.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "This is a reminder that Under the terms of the Planning Act 2008 (as amended) and Community Infrastructure Levy Regulations 2010 (as amended), should an application for appeal be allowed, the proposed development would be deemed as 'chargeable development' and therefore liable to pay the London Borough of Hillingdon Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and the Mayor of London's Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This would be calculated in accordance with the London Borough of Hillingdon CIL Charging Schedule 2014 and the Mayor of London's CIL Charging Schedule 2012.
