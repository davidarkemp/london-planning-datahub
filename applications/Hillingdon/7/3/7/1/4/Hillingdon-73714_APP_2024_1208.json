    "The proposed boundary wall and gates by reason of their position on the site frontage, excessive height, design and appearance, would form an uncharacteristic and incongruous addition to the area, which would fail to integrate with street scene and the wider area, to the detriment of the visual amenities of the street scene and the character and appearance of the surrounding area. The proposed development is therefore contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "Due to its location, height and proposed design, the proposed development would reduce pedestrian and motorist visibility which would be  detrimental to pedestrian and highway safety. The development is therefore considered to be contrary to Policies DMT 1, DMT 2 and DMT 5 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), as well as policy T4 of the London Plan and paragraph 116 (c) of the NPPF (2023)."
