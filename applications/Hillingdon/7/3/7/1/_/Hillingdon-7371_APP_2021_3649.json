    "Due to their excessive depth and height, as well as the fact that the property has already been significantly extended the proposed works are considered to result in a property that has been disproportionately extended; subsequently harming its original character and appearance. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policy DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "Due to its width, depth and site coverage the resulting dwelling would lead to a significant loss of visual openness on this prominent corner plot site, causing harm to the character and appearance of the area. It would result in some closing of the important visual gap (between No.55 and No.51 Wimborne Avenue) causing further harm to an area characterised by properties which have good spacing between them. The resulting gardens would be unusually small and cramped when compared with other properties in the area and due to its size and siting the side extension (closest to Dorchester Waye) would break the building line of that road. The proposal would therefore represent an overdevelopment of the site to the detriment of the visual amenities of the street scene and the character and appearance of the surrounding area and is considered to be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11, DMHB12 and DMHD 1 of the H",
    "Due to their siting (in close proximity to the highway) the proposed entrance gates on Dorchester Waye are likely to cause undue traffic build up and congestion on the local highways network to the detriment of its users. Furthermore a lamppost is sited directly in front of the new widened vehicular access on Wimborne Avenue, it is therefore uncertain whether vehicles could enter and exit the site safely (around the post) without creating a hazardous environment for pedestrians, it is also uncertain whether visibility splays could be achieved due to the siting of the post. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies DMT2 and DMT6 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "The new rear vehicular access (Dorchester Waye) is located in close proximity to trees which contribute to the suburban appearance of the area. Insufficient information has been submitted to demonstrate that the proposed development would not lead to the loss of these important trees. Loss of the trees would be harmful to the areas character and appearance. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policy DMHB 14 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
