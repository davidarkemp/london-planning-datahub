    "The proposal fails to demonstrate it will provide sufficient parking provision for the proposed development and would therefore result in an increase in on-street car parking in an area where parking demand already exceeds supply, thereby leading to conditions which would be prejudicial to the operation of the highway network and pedestrian and highway safety. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies AM7 and AM14 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Saved UDP Policies (November 2012), to Hillingdon's Adopted Parking Standards as set out in the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Unitary Development Plan Saved Policies (November 2012) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document HDAS: Residential Layouts.",

On the 8th November 2012 Hillingdon's Full Council agreed the adoption of the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies. Appendix 5 of this explains which saved policies from the old Unitary Development (which was subject to a direction from Secretary of State in September 2007 agreeing that the policies were 'saved') still apply for development control decisions.",
