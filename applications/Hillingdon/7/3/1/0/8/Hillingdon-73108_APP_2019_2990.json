  "description": "Part two storey, part single storey, part first floor rear extension to extend GP surgery and change of use of existing first and second floors from Use Class D1 (Non-Residential Institutions) to Use Class C3 (Dwellings) to create 2 x self-contained studio flats with assoicated parking",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposal would provide an indoor living area of an unsatisfactory size for the future occupiers of the first floor one bedroom flat and would therefore give rise to a substandard form of living accommodation to the detriment of the amenity of future occupiers. The proposal is thus contrary to Policy DMHB 16 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy D6 and Table 3.1 of the London Plan (2021), the Mayor of London's adopted Supplementary Planning Guidance - Housing (March 2016) and the Technical Housing Standards - Nationally Described Space Standard (March 2015).",
    "The proposed development, by virtue of the siting, size, scale, bulk, design and proximity of the first floor extension, would be detrimental to the amenities of the adjoining occupiers at 165 and 167 North Hyde Road, by reason of overdominance, overshadowing, visual intrusion, loss of light and loss of outlook. Therefore, the proposal would be contrary to Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The proposal, by reason of the lack of car parking for the existing and proposed use, has not demonstrated that sufficient off street parking arrangements would be provided for the existing use and proposed development and that the development would not result in on-street parking/queuing to the detriment of public and highway safety. The proposal is thus contrary to policies DMT 1, DMT 2 and DMT 6 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020) and to Hillingdon's Adopted Parking Standards as set out in Appendix C of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020)."
