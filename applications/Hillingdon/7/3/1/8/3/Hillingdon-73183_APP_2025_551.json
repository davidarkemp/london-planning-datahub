  "decision_conditions": [
    "The artificial 'tree' structures harm the character and appearance of the surrounding area due to the substandard materials being visually unattractive, the excessive height and scale of the artificial structures being highly visible and prominent, and the current and potentially long-term degradation resulting in the artificial structures appearing even more unattractive and creating plastic pollution. Subsequently, it is considered the installation of the artificial structures fails to accord with Policies D3, G1, and G7 of The London Plan (2021), Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One Strategic Policies (2012), and Policies DMHB 11 and DMHB 14 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The artificial 'tree' structures harm the residential amenity of neighbouring occupiers due to the substandard materials being highly visible and visually unattractive, impacting the quality of outlook of neighbouring occupiers, and the excessive height and scale creating substantial artificial overshadowing of neighbouring properties unduly impacting the daylight and sunlight access of neighbouring occupiers. Subsequently, it is considered the installation of the artificial structures fails to accord with Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021), Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One Strategic Policies (2012), and Policy DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The artificial 'tree' structures fail to provide any biodiversity benefit and are poor-quality and inappropriate additions to the natural landscaped character of the area. The installation of the 'trees' prevents the planting of natural landscaping as previously approved within the site's rear yard, resulting in the loss of biodiversity and greening. Subsequently, installing the artificial structures in place of trees fails to comply with Policies G1 and G7 of The London Plan (2021), the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012), and Policy DMHB 14 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020)."
