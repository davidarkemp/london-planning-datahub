    "The proposal is for a detached structure which, by reason of its size, scale, layout and independent access, is considered capable of independent occupation from the main dwelling and is thus tantamount to a separate dwelling in a position where such a dwelling would not be acceptable as it could result in unacceptable impact on adjoining occupiers and additional requirements for parking and amenity space. The proposal is therefore contrary to policies DMHB 11, DMHD 2, DMHB 18 and DMT 6 of the London Borough of Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two-Development Management Policies and Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "The proposed outbuilding and existing single storey rear extension by reason of their cumulative excessive footprint would fail to appear as subordinate additions to the site and would thus fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original dwelling, would be detrimental to the character, appearance and  visual amenities of the surrounding area. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies BE1 and HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 1, DMHB 4, DMHB 11, DMHD 1 and DMHD 2 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), Policy HC1 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2019).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2021). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020."
