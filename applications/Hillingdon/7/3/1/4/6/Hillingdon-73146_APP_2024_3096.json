    "The changes to the location of the proposed development would prejudice neighbours through a lack of consultation. The erection of a sizeable building to the rear of the development site would prejudice neighbours through a lack of consultation. Additionally, the original description of the development does not cover the material changes proposed, again prejudicing neighbours through a lack of consultation. The proposed building would also be contrary to policies set out within the Development Plan.",
    "In conclusion the changes cannot be considered non-material as they represent a form of development that differs materially from the planning approval. As such the development cannot be considered to comply with Section 96A of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 and this application is recommended for refusal."
