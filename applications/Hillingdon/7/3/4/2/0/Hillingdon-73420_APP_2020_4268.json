  "description": "(Cross Borough Boundary Application) Outline planning application with the details of access, appearance, landscaping, layout and scale reserved for later determination. Demolition and redevelopment to comprise a data centre (Use Class B8 (Data Centre) or Sui Generis (Data Centre) of up to 55,000 sq.m (GEA) including ancillary offices, internal plant and equipment and substation. In addition to the above the Development may also include: car parking; provision of external plant and equipment and fuel storage; creation of servicing areas and provision of associated services, including waste, refuse, cycle storage and lighting; and for the laying out of the buildings; routes and open spaces within the development; realignment of railhead; all associated and ancillary works and operations including but not limited to: demolition; earthworks; and provision of attenuation infrastructure and engineering operations.",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed development, by reason of its siting, size, scale, and design, would constitute inappropriate development within designated Green Belt land and very special circumstances do not exist to outweigh the harm to the Green Belt by reason of inappropriateness. As such, the proposal is contrary to Policy EM2 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 (2012), Policy DMEI 4 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 (2020), Policy G2 of the London Plan (2021) and Paragraphs 147 to 150 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The application site is not located in an area identified as suitable for tall buildings and the proposed development would constitute a tall building by exceeding 18 metres in height, by being substantially taller than the surroundings and by causing a significant change to the skyline. Further, the proposed development, by reason of its siting, size, and scale, would be detrimental to the open, greenfield and Green Belt character, appearance and visual amenities of the area within immediate and mid-range views, and wider townscape/landscape context in long-range views, contrary to Policies BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 (2012), Policies DMHB 10 and DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 (2020), Policy D9 of the London Plan (2021) and Paragraph 130 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The proposed development produces moderate to substantial adverse impacts, with no mitigation proposed; additional pollution is generated to breach the legislated limit values for NO2; and the proposed development is not air quality neutral. In this case, the financial contribution calculated to mitigate such impacts is significant and the associated air quality impact could not practically be mitigated through off-site measures. As such, this represents a reason for refusal which cannot be mitigated through a planning obligation and is contrary to Policy EM8 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 (2012), Policy DMEI 14 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 (2020), Policy SI 1 of the London Plan (2021) and Paragraph 186 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "Insufficient information has been submitted to demonstrate that the proposed development is likely to achieve a minimum of a 35% carbon emission reduction on-site and that carbon offsetting will be applied for any residual regulated carbon emissions. In this case, the carbon offset contribution to mitigate such impacts could be significant and the associated impact on emissions could not practically be mitigated through off-site measures. As such, this represents a reason for refusal which cannot be mitigated through a planning obligation and is contrary to Policy EM1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 (2012), Policy DMEI 2 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 (2020) and Policy SI 2 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "Insufficient information has been submitted to demonstrate that the realignment of the railhead and the associated loss of its use would not have detrimental impacts to the local highway network and air quality, contrary to Policy EM8 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 (2012), Policies DMT 1, DMT 2 and DMEI 14 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 (2020), Policies T4 and SI 1 of the London Plan (2021) and Paragraph 186 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The applicant has failed to secure Section 106 planning obligations required as a consequence of demands created by the proposed development (in respect of carbon offsetting, air quality, employment, construction training, travel planning, project management and monitoring). The scheme therefore conflicts with Policy DMCI 7 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 (2020); the adopted Planning Obligations Supplementary Planning Document (2014); Policy DF1 of the London Plan (2021); and paragraphs 54-57 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan 2021 and national guidance.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service. We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal.",
    "This is a reminder that Under the terms of the Planning Act 2008 (as amended) and Community Infrastructure Levy Regulations 2010 (as amended), should an application for appeal be allowed, the proposed development would be deemed as 'chargeable development' and therefore liable to pay the London Borough of Hillingdon Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and the Mayor of London's Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This would be calculated in accordance with the London Borough of Hillingdon CIL Charging Schedule 2014 and the Mayor of London's CIL Charging Schedule 2012.",
