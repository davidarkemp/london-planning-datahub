    "The site is located within Flood Zone 2 and 3 and the proposed nursery use represents a more vulnerable development in terms of the flood risk associated with the site. The application fails to demonstrate that the development could not be provided on a reasonably available site at a lower risk of flooding. The development constitutes inappropriate development in an area at risk of flooding without sufficient justification and is contrary to paragraphs 165 and 168 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023), Policy SI 12 of the London Plan (2021), Policy EM6 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 (2012) and Policy DMEI 9 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 (2020).",
    "The proposed development would result in significant loss of protected open space in Eastcote which is identified as a Ward with insufficient open space provision. The loss is not justified and the development is contrary to paragraph 103 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023), Policy G4 of the London Plan (2021), Policy EM4 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 (2012), and Policy DMCI 3 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 (2020).",
    "The proposed development does not provide adequate on-site car parking, pick-up and drop-off facilities. The application submission fails to fully demonstrate that the proposal would not give rise to adverse impacts upon the highway network to the detriment of traffic congestion, parking stress and highway safety. Based on the information submitted, the proposed development is considered to have an unacceptable impact on highway safety. As such, the proposal is contrary to Policies DMT 1 and DMT 2 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 (2020), and Policies T2, T4 and T5 of the London Plan (2021), and is refused in accordance with paragraph 115 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023).",
    "The proposed development, by reason of its scale and prominence, would result in an uncharacteristic form of development that would fail to harmonise with the local character within the Conservation Area and setting of Grade II Listed Buildings. The harm identified is not outweighed by public benefits and the proposed development would not preserve or enhance, but have a detrimental impact on the character, appearance and visual amenities of the area. The proposed development is contrary to paragraphs 139 and 205-214 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023), Policy HC1 of the London Plan (2021), Policies HE1 and BE 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 (2012), Policies DMHB 1, DMHB 4 and DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 (2020).",
    "The application has failed to justify the need for the layout of development which is likely to result in harm to protected trees, including but not limited to trees T13 and T9 which are category A and B value trees. The application fails to demonstrate that these trees would be protected and retained in the long term. Accordingly, the development could result in adverse and irreversible impacts to landscaping, trees, biodiversity or other natural features of merit, detrimental to the visual amenities of the area and Eastcote Village Conservation Area, contrary to paragraph 136 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023), Policy G7 of the London Plan (2021), and Policies DMHB 4, DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHB 14 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 (2020).",
    "The proposed development would likely contribute to the production of unacceptable pollutant emissions in the Eastcote Village Air Quality Focus Area. The proposed development would not be air quality neutral or air quality positive and the measures proposed are not sufficient to mitigate the total emissions. As such, the development is contrary to Policy EM8 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 (2012), Policy DMEI 14 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 (2020), Policy SI 1 of the London Plan (2021) and paragraphs 180(e) and 192 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023).",
    "The applicant has failed to secure Section 106 planning obligations required to mitigate the harm and demands created by the proposed development (in respect of travel planning, air quality, and project management and monitoring). The scheme therefore conflicts with Policy DMCI 7 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 (2020); the adopted Planning Obligations Supplementary Planning Document (2014); Policy DF1 of the London Plan (2021); and paragraphs 55-58 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan (2021) and national guidance.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service. We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal.",
    "This is a reminder that Under the terms of the Planning Act 2008 (as amended) and Community Infrastructure Levy Regulations 2010 (as amended), should an application for appeal be allowed, the proposed development would be deemed as 'chargeable development' and therefore liable to pay the London Borough of Hillingdon Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and the Mayor of London's Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This would be calculated in accordance with the London Borough of Hillingdon CIL Charging Schedule 2014 and the Mayor of London's CIL Charging Schedule 2012.",
