    "By reason of their cumulative size, scale, bulk, siting forward of the return building line and design, the proposed extensions would result in a disproportionate, cramped, visually obtrusive and incongruous form of development that would be detrimental to the appearance of the original host dwelling, and would cause harm to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the existing street scene. The proposal is, therefore, contrary to Chapter 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023), Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021), Policy BE 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2021), and Policies DMHD 1 and DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management (2020).",
    "The proposal would cause undue harm to the living conditions of neighbouring occupiers at 30 Britchford Road by way of an unacceptable loss of privacy from the proposed first-floor rear-facing bedroom dormer window. The proposal would, therefore, fail to accord with the objectives of Policies DMHD 1 and DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) in this respect.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
