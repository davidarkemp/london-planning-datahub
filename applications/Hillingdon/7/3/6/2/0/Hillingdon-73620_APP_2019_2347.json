    "The proposed intensification of the storage use is considered to be excessive for the site and would result in an unacceptable level of noise and general disturbance through the scale of activities involved to the detriment of the amenities of nearby residential properties and the function of the parade of retail shops served by the service road. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies S6, S11, OE1 and OE3 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Saved UDP Policies (November 2012), Policy DMTC 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2- Development Management Polices with Modifications (March 2019), Policy 7.15 of the London Plan (2016) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document HDAS: Noise.",
    "The proposed two storey building by virtue of its size, scale, bulk, height and proximity, would be detrimental to the amenities of the adjacent occupiers of the flats at 117 Pinner Road by reason of loss of outlook and overdominance. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policies BE21 and BE24 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Saved UDP Policies (November 2012), Policy DMHB11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2- Development Management Polices with Modifications (March 2019) and the Council's adopted Supplementary Planning Document HDAS: Residential Layouts.",
    "The proposal would result in the reduction of scale of the existing turning head, rendering it unusable and resulting in large delivery vehicles reversing excessive distances, thereby leading to conditions which would be prejudicial to the operation of the highway network and pedestrian and highway safety. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies AM7 and AM14 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Saved UDP Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMT 1 and DMT 2  of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2- Development Management Polices with Modifications (March 2019).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant saved policies (referred to as policies from the Hillingdon Unitary Development Plan - Saved Policies September 2007), then London Plan Policies (2016).  On the 8th November 2012 Hillingdon's Full Council agreed the adoption of the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies. Appendix 5 of this explains which saved policies from the old Unitary Development (which was subject to a direction from Secretary of State in September 2007 agreeing that the policies were 'saved') still apply for development control decisions.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the 'Saved' UDP 2007, Local Plan Part 1, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service."
