    "The new crossing should conform to the council's 'Domestic Vehicle Footway Crossover' (DVFC) 2022 Policy i.e. it should measure a maximum of 5m in width at the back of footway (or boundary fence line in this case) and 6.2m at the edge of kerb. It should also be noted that the new crossing would need to be constructed to the appropriate council standard executed under S184 of the Highways Act 1980 (or suitable alternative arrangement) at the applicant's/developer's expense. A 'back of footway' width of 2.7m has been indicated on plan which suggests conformity to the above parameter leaving the finer detail to be arranged with LBH's 'Highways Delivery' service post-permission. It is likely that a wider crossover will need to be provided to adequately cater for the two parking spaces given their 'side by side' arrangement. The new crossover will also trigger the need to remove and relocate the existing street lighting column fronting the site which again would be financed by the applicant"
