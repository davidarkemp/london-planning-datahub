    "The development would lead to the unacceptable subdivision and loss of family-sized accommodation for which there is an established need in the Borough and an over-intensive form of development. The development would therefore be contrary to policy DMH 4 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "The development by virtue of its substandard and cramped internal floor areas, compromised outlook and privacy, insufficient daylight and natural ventilation, and substandard provision of private outdoor amenity space, would result in poor quality living conditions for future residents of the proposed homes. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies DMHB 16 and DMHB 18 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020) and Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "The proposed rear dormer, by reason of its siting, design and scale would appear as an unsympathetic addition that would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original building to the detriment of the character, appearance and visual amenity of the area. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012) and Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The proposal has not demonstrated that sufficient off street parking arrangements would be provided, and therefore the development would result in substandard car parking provision, leading to on-street parking/queuing to the detriment of public and highway safety. Therefore the development would be contrary to policies DMT 2 and DMT 6 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and to Hillingdon's Adopted Parking Standards as set out in Appendix C of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The proposal, by reason of the excessive hardstanding to the front of the site and lack of landscaping provision, would result in an unduly prominent and visually intrusive form of development, to the detriment of the appearance and visual amenities of the street scene and character of the area. Therefore the development would be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012) and Policies DMHB 11 and DMHB 14 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan (2021) and national guidance.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal.",
    "This is a reminder that under the terms of the Planning Act 2008 (as amended) and Community Infrastructure Levy Regulations 2010 (as amended), should an application for appeal be allowed, the proposed development would be deemed as 'chargeable development' and therefore liable to pay the London Borough of Hillingdon Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and the Mayor of London's Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This would be calculated in accordance with the London Borough of Hillingdon CIL Charging Schedule 2014 and the Mayor of London's CIL Charging Schedule 2019.
