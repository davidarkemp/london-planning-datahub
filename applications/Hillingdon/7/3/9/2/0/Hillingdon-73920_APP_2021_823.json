    "The proposed development, by virtue of its size, scale, bulk, height, proximity, and the position of second floor windows, would be detrimental to the amenities of the adjacent  occupiers at Numbers  8, 9, 10, 11 and 17 Ferndown  by reason of overdominance, visual intrusion, loss of outlook and loss of privacy. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policy DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan - Part Two (2020).",
    "The proposed development, by reason of its siting, size, scale, bulk and roof design, fails to harmonise with the established local context, to the detriment of the character, appearance and visual amenities of the street scene and the wider area. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy BE 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policy DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (January 2020) and Policies D3 and D6 of the London Plan (March 2021).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan - The Spatial Development Strategy for London consolidated with alterations since 2011 (2016) and national guidance.",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2021). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "This is a reminder that Under the terms of the Planning Act 2008 (as amended) and Community Infrastructure Levy Regulations 2010 (as amended), should an application for appeal be allowed, the proposed development would be deemed as 'chargeable development' and therefore liable to pay the London Borough of Hillingdon Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and the Mayor of London's Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This would be calculated in accordance with the London Borough of Hillingdon CIL Charging Schedule 2014 and the Mayor of London's CIL Charging Schedule 2012.",
