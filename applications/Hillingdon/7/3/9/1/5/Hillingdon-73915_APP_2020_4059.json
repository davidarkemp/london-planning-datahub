  "description": "Two storey side/rear extension and extension to existing rear dormer, following the demolition of the detached garage",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed two storey side/rear extension, by reason of its siting, scale, bulk, and proximity to the side boundary, would result in a closing of the open gap between it and the neighbouring property at number 19 Tiverton Road. The proposal would therefore give rise to a cramped form of development and potentially create a precedent for a terracing effect. Furthermore, the proposed two storey side/rear extension, in the absence of a set-back from the front elevation of the host dwelling and set-down from the main ridge line, would fail to appear as a subordinate addition.  The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2019).",
    "The proposed extension to the existing rear dormer, by virtue of its design and cumulative size, scale and bulk, would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the host dwelling and would be detrimental to the character, appearance and visual amenitiesof the surrounding area.  The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2019).",
    "The proposed two storey side/rear extension, by virtue of its size, scale, bulk, height and proximity, would be detrimental to the amenities of the neighbouring occupiers at number 19 Tiverton Road,  by reason of overbearing effect, sense of enclosure and loss of outlook. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2019).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2016). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020."
