  "description": "Part two storey, part single storey rear extension and conversion of roof space to habitable use to include a rear dormer, conversion of roof from hip to gable end with a new gable end window and conversion from 2 x 2-bed flats to 3 x studio flats and 1 x 1-bed self contained flat",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The roof alteration/extensions, by reason of the hip to gable end roof design and the size, scale, bulk, and design of the rear dormer window, in this visually prominent position, would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original semi-detached property, would be detrimental to the character, appearance and symmetry of the pair of semi-detached properties of which it forms a part and to the visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "The proposed two storey rear extension, by reason of its siting in this visually prominent position, size, scale, bulk, and design, including multiple roof lines and intersection with the proposed roof works, would represent a visually unsympathetic form of development that would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original property, would be detrimental to the character, appearance and symmetry of the pair of semi detached properties of which it forms a part and to the visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The proposal would provide an indoor living area of an unsatisfactory size and quality for the future occupiers of the proposed Flat C and would therefore give rise to a substandard form of living accommodation to the detriment of the amenity of future occupiers. The proposal is thus contrary to Policy DMHB 16 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), Policy 3.5 and Table 3.3 of the London Plan (2016), the Housing Standards Minor Alterations to The London Plan (March 2016), the Mayor of London's adopted Supplementary Planning Guidance - Housing (March 2016) and the Technical Housing Standards - Nationally Described Space Standard (March 2015).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2016). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service."
