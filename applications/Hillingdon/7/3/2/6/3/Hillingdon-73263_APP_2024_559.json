    "The removal of the jetties and its platform and sheet piles that were made up for the cofferdam and abutments is the most appropriate restoration for the area as it returns the site to areas of open waterbody. This Schedule 17 Site Restoration scheme reflects the wider Schedule 17 Site Restoration Intent delivered by the approval of Groundwork South (ALJ-TP-0040 and ALJ-TP-0232) under planning application ref: 73263/APP/2022/1497 by London Borough Hillingdon and Groundwork North (ALJ-TP-0231) under planning application ref: PL/22/3611/HS2 by Buckinghamshire Council. The design is also environmentally sensitive and leaves the lakebeds in an appropriate condition. It is therefore recommended that the application be approved, in accordance with Schedule 17, Part 1, Paragraph 3, of the High Speed Rail (London - West Midlands) Act 2017."
