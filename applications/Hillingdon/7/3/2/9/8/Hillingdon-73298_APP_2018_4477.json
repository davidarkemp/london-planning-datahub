  "description": "Demolition of existing buildings and redevelopment of the site to provide 24 residential units (14 x 1 bed, 8 x 2 bed and 2 x 3 bed)  in a part 3, part 4 storey building and associated car parking, cycle parking, access and refuse",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed development, by reason of its overall size, scale, bulk and detailed design would result in a disproportionately large, dominating and incongruous form of development, which represents an over-development of the site, and fails to provide an adequate setback from the street, in particular the 4-storey building with rooftop amenity space set against the southern boundary which would be highly visible from Uxbridge Road and Newport Road would fail to respect the pattern and scale of development in the immediate area. The proposal would be detrimental to the visual amenities of the street scene and the character and appearance of the wider area, contrary to Policies 3.4, 7.1 and  7.6 of the London Plan (2016), Policies BE1 and HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies BE13 and BE19 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Saved UDP Policies (November 2012); Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHB 14 of the Hillingdon Revised Proposed",
    "The proposed development, by virtue of its size, scale, bulk, design and proximity, would be detrimental to the amenities of the adjoining occupiers at 1200 Uxbridge Road by reason of overdominance, overshadowing, visual intrusion, loss of light and loss of outlook. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to policy BE1 of the Local Plan Part 1 (2012), policies BE19, BE20 and BE21 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Saved UDP Policies (November 2012) and the Council's adopted Supplementary Planning Document HDAS: Residential Extensions and policy DMHB11 of the Hillingdon Revised Proposed Submission Version of the Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2019).",
    "The proposed width of the vehicular access and proposed refuse store would result in vehicles temporarily stopping along Newport Road in order to give way to vehicles attempting to enter or exit the site. This will obstruct the free-flow of traffic resulting in a detrimental  impact on highways safety, or residual cumulative impacts on the road network which would be severe and therefore contrary to Policy AM7 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Saved UDP Policies (November 2012), Policies DMT 2 and DMT 5 of the the Hillingdon Revised Proposed Submission Version of the Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2019), Policy 6.12 of the London Plan (2016) and Chapter 9 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2019).",
    "The proposed development fails to provide on site private and communal amenity space of a quantity and quality commensurate to the size and layout of the proposals. Furthermore, the communal amenity areas are situated directly outside habitable rooms and balconies which would result in overlooking from communal spaces into balconies and habitable rooms at ground floor level. Such an arrangement would be detrimental to the residential amenity of the future occupiers the proposal would provide a substandard form of accommodation for future residents contrary to Policies BE21 and BE23 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Saved UDP Policies (November 2012), DMCI 4 and DMCI 5 of the Hillingdon Revised Proposed Submission Version of the Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2019) , the adopted Supplementary Planning Document HDAS: Residential Layouts and Policy 7.1 of the London Plan (2016).",
    "The proposed development, in the absence of a Section 106 legal agreement fails to provide contributions towards the improvements of services and facilities as a consequence of demands created by the proposed development including a permit free development, affordable housing contribution, carbon offset contribution of £35,370 and air quality damage cost of £16,400 and a contribution towards off-site sustainable urban drainage). Given that a legal agreement to address this issue has not at this stage been offered or secured, the proposal is considered to be contrary to Policy R17 of the the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Saved UDP Policies (November 2012), DMCI 7 of the Hillingdon Revised Proposed Submission Version of the Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2019) , Policy 3.6, 3.10, 3.13, 5.2 and 8.2 of the London Plan (2016) and the London Borough of Hillingdon's Supplementary Planning Document on Planning Obligations.",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Unitary Development Plan Saved Policies (September 2007) as incorporated into the Hillingdon Local Plan (2012) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan - The Spatial Development Strategy for London consolidated with alterations since 2011 (2016) and national guidance.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the 'Saved' UDP 2007, Local Plan Part 1, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "a), b) or c) to be added depending on the refusal circumstances:",
    "a) We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal.",
    "b) In order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably. In addition further guidance was offered to the applicant by the case officer during the processing of the a",
    "This is a reminder that Under the terms of the Planning Act 2008 (as amended) and Community Infrastructure Levy Regulations 2010 (as amended), should an application for appeal be allowed, the proposed development would be deemed as 'chargeable development' and therefore liable to pay the London Borough of Hillingdon Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and the Mayor of London's Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This would be calculated in accordance with the London Borough of Hillingdon CIL Charging Schedule 2014 and the Mayor of London's CIL Charging Schedule 2012.",
