    "The proposed extension, by virtue of its size, scale, bulk and proximity, would be detrimental to the amenities of the adjoining occupiers at 9 Attlee Road by reason of overdominance, overshadowing, visual intrusion, loss of outlook and loss of sunlight. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to policies BE19, BE20 and BE21 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Saved UDP Policies (November 2012) and the Council's adopted Supplementary Planning Document HDAS: Residential Extensions.",
    "The proposed two storey side/rear extension, by reason of its siting, size, scale, bulk, staggered siting with adjacent Number 9 Attlee Road and proximity to the side boundary, would result in the loss of an important gap, characteristic to the area and the loss of the sense of spaciousness between the application dwelling and the side boundary. This would give rise to a cramped form of development on the site. The proposal would therefore represent an overdevelopment of the site, would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original dwelling and would be detrimental to the visual amenities of the street scene and the character and appearance of the wider Barnhill Estate Area of Special Local Character. The proposed development is therefore contrary to Policies BE1 and HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies BE5, BE13, BE15, BE19 and BE22 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Saved UDP Policies (November 2012) an",
    "The proposed two storey side/rear extension, by reason of its siting, size, scale and bulk in combination with the previous roof extension, would result in an incongruous addition which would be detrimental to the architectural composition of the existing building, the street scene, and would harm the character and appearance of the wider area which lies within the Barnhill Estate Area of Special Local Character. The proposed development is therefore contrary to Policies BE1 and HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies BE5, BE13, BE15, BE19 and BE22 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Saved UDP Policies (November 2012) and the Council's adopted Supplementary Planning Document HDAS: Residential Extensions.",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant saved policies (referred to as policies from the Hillingdon Unitary Development Plan - Saved Policies September 2007), then London Plan Policies (2016).  On the 8th November 2012 Hillingdon's Full Council agreed the adoption of the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies. Appendix 5 of this explains which saved policies from the old Unitary Development (which was subject to a direction from Secretary of State in September 2007 agreeing that the policies were 'saved') still apply for development control decisions.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the 'Saved' UDP 2007, Local Plan Part 1, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service. This is a resubmission of a previously refused scheme, where the IOfficers Report identified issues to be addressed, which were reflected in the reasons for refusal, allowing the opportunity to address those issues within this submission."
