    "The proposed development, by reason its size, scale, bulk, design and siting would result in a detrimental impact upon the residential amenities of neighbouring properties with a reduction in light and outlook, as well as harmful sense of enclosure.  Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11 and DMH 6, of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020) and Section 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The proposed dwelling, by reason its size, scale, bulk, poor design and siting on top of the existing outrigger, would appear as a cramped, contrived and incongruous form of development which would be detrimental to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area, failing to respect the architectural integrity of the host dwelling and its terrace group. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11, DMH 6, and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), policy D3 of the London Plan (2021) and Section 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",

As such the proposal fails to satisfy Policies DMT 1, DMT 2 and DMT 6 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 Development Management Policies (2020), having implications for highway and pedestrian safety, failing to encourage sustainable modes of travel.",
    "The proposal fails to provide amenity space of sufficient size and quality commensurate to the size and layout of the proposed new unit. As such the proposal would provide a substandard form of accommodation for future residents and is therefore contrary to Policies DMHB 11 and DMHB 18 of the the Hillngdon Local Plan : Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
