    "The proposed first floor rear extension by virtue of its depth, height and siting is considered to have an unacceptable impact on the amenities of the neighbouring property Number 569 Uxbridge Road by way of overbearing impact, over dominance, loss of light and overshadowing. In the absence of a BRE daylight and sunlight assessment, the application has failed to demonstrate that the proposed development would not lead to a loss of light, significant overshadowing or overbearing impact to the adjoining neighbouring property number Number 569 Uxbridge Road. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012), Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2024).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service."
