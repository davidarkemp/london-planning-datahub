    "By virtue of its siting and the inability for vehicles to access and exit the site in a forward gear, the proposed vehicle crossover would significantly reduce highway, pedestrian and cyclist safety. The proposed development is therefore considered to be contrary to Policy DMT 2 of Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2, Development Management Policies (2020) and London Plan (2021) Policy T4 and the Council's 2022 Domestic Vehicle Footway Crossover Policy, as well as the NPPF, in particular Paragraph 116.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
