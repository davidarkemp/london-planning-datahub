  "site_name": "53-55",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed development, by virtue of its excessive size, bulk, and prominent corner plot location, would cumulatively result in a cramped and visually incongruous form of development that would be detrimental to the character and appearance of the original properties and surrounding area. The proposal is, therefore, contrary to Chapter 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2024), Policies D1, D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021), Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012), and Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management (2020).",
    "The proposed extensions would, by virtue of their failure to maintain an adequate amount of private usable external amenity space for the occupiers of the existing properties, result in over-development of the site detrimental to the residential amenity of the existing occupiers. The proposal is therefore contrary to policies DMHD 1, DMHB 18, and Table 5.3 of Hillingdon Council's Local Plan Part 2 Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
