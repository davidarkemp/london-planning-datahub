    "Due to its external finishes (green metal roller shutters, silver metallic walls and grey fibre roof), the proposed building would form a visually incongruous addition to the area that would be at odds with all other outbuildings. Furthermore, the uncomplimentary mixture of external finishes creates a building with a low-cost, unstable and temporary appearance, which is considered to be of poor design. Consequently, the proposed development is considered to be an eyesore which would be detrimental to the visual amenities of the area and contrary to policies DMHD 2, DMHB 11, and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two (2020), Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021) and paragraph 135 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2024).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan (2021) and NPPF (2024)."
