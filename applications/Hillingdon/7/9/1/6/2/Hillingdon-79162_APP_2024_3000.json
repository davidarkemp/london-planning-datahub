    "The original size of the property is under the minimum size requirement for the conversion of the building into flats and the proposed 3 bedroom unit on the ground floor does not meet the minimum space standard. As such, the development would result in the loss of a residential  unit that is suitable and appropriately sized for a family. The proposal would therefore unacceptably undermine the supply of family housing within the Borough for which there is an identified need, contrary to Policies DMH 1, DMH 2 and DMH 4  of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy H10 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2024).",
    "By reason of its undersized internal floor area, lack of in built storage, proximity of the rear bedroom windows to the proposed fenced boundary and light spillage into the front facing bedroom due to location of the front parking, the proposed ground floor 3 bedroom flat would fail to provide satisfactory internal amenity space for future occupiers and would therefore subject future occupiers to cramped internal living accommodation to the detriment of their amenities, as well as creating a loss of natural light to habitable rooms, contrary to Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021) and Policy DMHB 16 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2- Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The proposed first floor rear extension would be positioned less than 21m away from the rear habitable rooms of number 5 Heather Close causing a harmful level of overlooking to the detriment of this neighbours amenities. As such, the development fails to comply with  Policy DMHB 11, of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and the NPPF (2024).",
    "In the absence of sufficient biodiversity net gain information, it has not been demonstrated that the proposal would deliver at least a 10% increase in biodiversity value relative to the pre-development biodiversity value of the onsite habitat. As the proposed development fails to provide an appropriate biodiversity net gain, it is contrary to Schedule 7A of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as inserted by Schedule 14 of the Environment Act 2021), Policy G6 of the London Plan (2021), Policy EM7 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012), and Policy DMEI 7 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two (2020).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan (2021) and NPPF (2024)."
