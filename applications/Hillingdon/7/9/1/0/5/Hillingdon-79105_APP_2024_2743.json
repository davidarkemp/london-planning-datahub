    "The proposed extensions, by virtue of their cumulative excessive height,  scale, bulk, and design, would represent disproportionate additions that would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original dwellings, would be detrimental to the character and appearance of the pair of semi-detached dwellings, and the visual amenities of the street scene and surrounding area. The proposal would, therefore, be contrary to the objectives of the NPPF (2024), Policies  D1, D3, and D4 of The London Plan (2021), Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan (2012), and Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
