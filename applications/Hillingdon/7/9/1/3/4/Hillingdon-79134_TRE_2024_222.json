    "The removal of deadwood, dangerous / hanging branches and ivy:  This does not require the formal consent of the Council.",

    "These trees are situated along side roads and grass areas on a housing block. The trees are mature and in good form. They can be seen by neighbours, road and footpath users. For this reason they have a high amenity value.",
    "Due to the high amenity value, a specification is required that will allow the trees to continue to flourish without major damage to them or the ecological and environmental amenity they provide.",
    "The specification of work is not clear and we have not received clarification of a revised specification when requested. Therefore the work is refused due to a lack of arboricultural reasoning."
