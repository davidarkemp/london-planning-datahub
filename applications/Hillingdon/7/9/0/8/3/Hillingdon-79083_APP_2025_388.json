    "The proposal would, by its depth, width, height, bulk, and siting, result in a built form which would be harmful to the amenities of the neighbouring occupiers at Number 40 and 42 New Garden Drive through loss of light and outlook, contrary to Policies D3 and D6 of The London Plan and Policies DMHD 1 and DMHB 11 of Hillingdon Council's Local Plan Part Two Development Management Policies (2020), which seek to protect residential amenity.",
    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate that the development will safeguard existing trees on the site and further fails to demonstrate protection for and long-term retention of the trees. The proposal is, therefore, contrary to Policies G7 of the London Plan (2021) and policies DMHB11 and DMHB14 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
