The proposal is, therefore, contrary to Chapter 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023), Policies D1, D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021), Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2021), and Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management (2020).",
