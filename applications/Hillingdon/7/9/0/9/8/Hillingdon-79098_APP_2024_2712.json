    "The proposed part single-storey, part two-storey rear extension, by virtue of its excessive scale, bulk, and proximity to a neighbouring property, and resulting overbearing appearance, loss of light, and overshadowing, would unduly harm the residential amenity of the adjoining occupiers at 55 Gade Close. The proposal is contrary to Policies D3 and D6 of the London Plan (2021) and Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
