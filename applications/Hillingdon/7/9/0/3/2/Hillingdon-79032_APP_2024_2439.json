    "The proposed replacement windows and doors by reason of their materials, detailing and fenestrations, would harm the character and appearance of the host dwelling, Grade II Listed Building, pair of semi-detached properties and Longford Conservation Area and would not retain or enhance the original architectural features that contribute to the local character. Accordingly, the proposal would be contrary to Chapter 12 and 16 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2024), Policies HC1 and D3, and D4 of The London Plan (2021), Policies BE1 and HE1 of Hillingdon Council's Local Plan Part 1 Strategic Policies (2012), and Policies DMHB 1, DMHB 2, DMHB 4, DMHB 11, DMHB 12, and DMHD 1 of the London Borough of Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "As the proposal relates to development to a Grade II Listed Building, Listed Building Consent is required, but has not been forthcoming. Notwithstanding this point, the application would have been refused due to the harm to the Grade II Listed Building."
