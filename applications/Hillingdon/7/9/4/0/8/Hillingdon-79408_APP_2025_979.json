    "On 1 July 1997, a new act, The Party Wall etc. Act 1996, came into force.",

Building Control will assume that an applicant has obtained any necessary agreements with the adjoining owner, and nothing said or implied by Building Control should be taken as removing the necessity for the building owner to comply fully with the Act."
