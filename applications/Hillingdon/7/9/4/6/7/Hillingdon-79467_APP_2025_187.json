    "Due to their cumulative visual impact when viewed alongside existing extensions, both of the proposed first floor extensions would result in overextended properties, with overcomplicated rear elevations and complex roof forms which fail to respect the size or architectural compositions of the original dwellings and would not appear subordinate additions. Together, the existing outbuildings, extensions and proposed extensions would result in plots and properties that are overdeveloped and out of character with those surrounding. The proposal would therefore be detrimental to the visual amenities of the host dwellings and character of the surrounding area, all contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies, Policies DMHD 1, DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021), as well as paragraph 135 of the NPPF (2024).",
    "The application fails to demonstrate that the development would not lead to an unacceptable reduction in the residential standards of accommodation with regards to the loss of outlook, daylight and sunlight for future occupants of the development. In addition the cumulative impact derived from the existing and proposed extensions results in an increased need for private amenity space which is already substandard and therefore fails to provide adequate levels of living accommodation to support the needs of existing and future occupiers of the properties.  As such the application fails to accord with Policies DMHB 16 and DMHB 18 of the Hillingdon Local Plan : Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021)",
    "The application fails to provide clear and consistent documents to allow for a full and proper assessment of the proposals. The application form incorrectly sites 1 address when the drawings refer to extensions to two properties, the existing plans are incorrectly labelled and fail to provide a full set of internal floor plans, the proposed elevations and floor plans do not correlate. Notwithstanding the inconsistencies Officers consider the proposals are a fundamental departure from the development plan policies and fail to accord with the Hillingdon Local Plan Parts 1 (November 2012) and 2 (January 2020) and the London Plan (2021) and the NPPF (2024).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan (2021) and national guidance."
