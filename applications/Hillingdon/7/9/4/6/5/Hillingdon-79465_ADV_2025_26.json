    "The development by virtue of its scale, siting, massing, design and visual prominence combined with the loss of existing trees and soft landscaping, would be harmful to the character, appearance and visual amenity of the site. The site is covered by Tree Preservation Order (TPO) No. 458 and the application has failed to demonstrate that existing trees would be protected and their long-term retention would be secured and as such the development fails to preserve and enhance the landscape setting of the area. Therefore the development is contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One (2012), Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 13A, DMHB 14 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two (2020), Policies D3, D8 and G1 of the London Plan (2021) and Sections 12 and 15 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2024).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2021). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
