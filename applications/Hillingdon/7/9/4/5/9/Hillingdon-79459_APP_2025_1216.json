    "The proposed telecommunication street pole and associated equipment, would infringe the Ministry of Defence height safeguarding criteria and would therefore disrupt airspace protected for visual manoeuvring prior to landing at RAF Northolt. Insufficient evidence has been submitted by the application to demonstrate otherwise.
