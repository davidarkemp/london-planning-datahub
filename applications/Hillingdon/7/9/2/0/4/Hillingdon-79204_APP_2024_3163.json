This is combined with the assessment principles and procedures detailed in guidance: 'Methods for rating and assessing industrial and commercial sound' British Standards Institution BS4142 2014.' This is used to set reference time periods for the assessment and adjust measured or calculated LAeq values for character as detailed in BS4142 to determine the rating level.",
