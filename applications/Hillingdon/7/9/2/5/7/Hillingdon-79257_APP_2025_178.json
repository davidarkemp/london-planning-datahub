  "decision_conditions": [
    "The installation of the boundary fence, by reason of its height, location, and design significantly reduces natural surveillance, harms the quality of the public realm, and would be detrimental to the visual amenity and character of the streetscene. The proposal is, therefore, contrary to Policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021), Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan (Part 1) (2012), and Policies DMHD 1, DMHB 11, and DMHB 15 of the Hillingdon Local Plan (Part 2) (2020).",
    "The Applicant has submitted insufficient details to demonstrate that Tree Preservation Order trees have not been harmed by the works, and where they may have been, that appropriate mitigation is proposed. The proposal, therefore, does not comply with Policy G7 of the London Plan (2021) and Policy DMHB 14 of Hillingdon Council's Local Plan Part Two Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "In dealing with the application, the Council has implemented the National Planning Policy Framework requirement to work with the applicant positively and proactively. We have made available detailed advice through our statutory policies from the Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, and offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "We have, however, been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the proposal is contrary to our statutory policies, and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
