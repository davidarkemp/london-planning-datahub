    "The proposed development, by virtue of its excessive scale, bulk, and inappropriate design, would be detrimental to the character, appearance, and visual amenity of the host dwelling, the street scene, and the Hillside, Northwood Hills Area of Special Local Character. The proposal is, therefore, contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2024), Policies D3 and D6 of the London Plan (2021), Policies BE1 and HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012), and Policies DMHB 1, DMHB 5, DMHB 11, and DMHD 1 of the Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The proposed rear extensions, by reason of their excessive scale, bulk, design and proximity, would result in an overly dominant feature that would unduly overshadow the adjoining properties and, as such, would result in a visually intrusive and unneighbourly form of development, leading to an unacceptable loss of light and harm to residential amenity. Therefore, the proposal would be contrary to Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan - Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020)."
