    "The proposed conversion of the existing dwelling into two residential units is unacceptable as the existing property of an insufficient size (approximately 77sqm) which falls significantly below the minimum threshold of 120 square metres required. As a result, the property is  unable to provide a suitable standard of housing units  that are of a sufficient quality to meet the borough's housing need as well as ensuring acceptable standards of living for future occupants.  The development would therefore be contrary to Policy H10 of the London Plan (2021) and Policies DMH 1 and DMH 4 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "The proposed rear extension, by reason of its 6m depth, would result in a visually incongruous form of development that would be detrimental to the character and appearance of the original property and surrounding area. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management (2020).",
    "The proposed rear extension, by reason of its 6m depth, would restrict the outlook from the rear conservatory and garden of 11 Roxburn Way, impacting the sense of spaciousness and openness of the neighbouring site and would restrict the access to daylight and sunlight of these areas, resulting in undue harm to the residential amenities of 11 Roxburn Way. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management (2020).",
    "The proposed development would fail to provide an acceptable living environment for future residents of the site, by reason that the proposed ground floor flat would not provide direct outlook for all habitable rooms and the proposed first floor flat would not provide adequate residential floorspace that meets minimum internal floor area requirements and the first floor flat would not be provided with good quality and usable private outdoor living space. The development has also failed to demonstrate adequate internal floor to ceiling heights and daylight access would be achieved for the habitable areas of the first floor flat. The occupiers of the new flats would therefore be subject to a poor standard of living accommodation to the detriment of their residential amenity and the development would be contrary to Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021) and Policies DMHB 16 and DMHB 18 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan (2021) and national guidance."
