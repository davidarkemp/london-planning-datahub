    "The single storey rear extension,  by reason of excessive depth, scale, and siting would result in unacceptable harm to the adjacent  house at 53 Walford Road in terms of loss of daylight/sunlight and visual outlook. As such, the proposed extension would fail to respect the residential amenity of neighbouring residents and would therefore conflict with National Planning Policy Framework (2024), Policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021) and Policies DMHB 1, and DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service."
