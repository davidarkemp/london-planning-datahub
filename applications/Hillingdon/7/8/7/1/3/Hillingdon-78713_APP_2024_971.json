Prior Approval is therefore refused.",
    "The proposed development does not constitute permitted development by virtue of the provisions of Schedule 2, Part 1, Class A of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015, as the proposed development would unduly detract from the residential amenity of the adjoining occupier at 140 Cornwall Road, by reason of loss of light and loss of outlook. The proposal is contrary to Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020) and Prior Approval is refused."
