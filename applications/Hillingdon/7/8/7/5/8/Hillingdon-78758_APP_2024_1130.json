    "The proposal would lead to a loss of office space within the Town Centre. Therefore, in the absence of sufficient supporting evidence to justify the loss of office space, it would be contrary with Policy DME 3 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two- Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The proposed development, by virtue of its poor outlook and poor levels of natural light and inadequate external amenity space provision would result in substandard forms of residential accommodation to the detriment of future occupants. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy DMHB 16 and DMHB 18 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2023)."
