The Applicant should direct water runoff from any roof or hard paving associated with the development to a soakaway or tank or make the paving permeable. This includes any work to front gardens not part of the planning application, which must be permeable or be collected and directed to a permeable area. Otherwise, it would need additional permission. The Applicant should incorporate a water butt.",
