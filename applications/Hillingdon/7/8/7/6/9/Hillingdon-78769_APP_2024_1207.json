    "The proposed single-storey rear extension, by virtue of its excessive size, scale, bulk, depth, and design, would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original building and would be detrimental to the character, appearance, and visual amenities of the street scene, failing to either preserve or enhance the character or appearance of the West Drayton Green Conservation Area. The proposal is, therefore, contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2023), Policies HC1 and D3 of the London Plan (2021), Policies BE1 and HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012), and Policies DMHB 1, DMHB 4, and DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The proposal would be tantamount to a separate self-contained residential unit, and such a dwelling would be unacceptable due to parking and amenity space requirements and the impact on adjoining properties. The proposal is, therefore, contrary to Policies DMHD 1, DMHB 11, DMHB 16, DMHB 18, DMT 2, and DMT 6 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service."
