    "The proposed extension, by reason of its size, scale, bulk, width, and proximity to the side boundary, in conjunction with previous extensions, would fail to appear as a subordinate addition, would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original dwelling, would result in the closing of an important gap characteristic to the area, resulting in a cramped appearance, and would be detrimental to the character, appearance, and visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area. Therefore, the proposal would be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012) and Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The proposed extension would, by virtue of its failure to maintain an adequate amount of private usable external amenity space for the occupiers of the existing property, result in over-development of the site, detrimental to the residential amenity of the existing occupiers. The proposal is, therefore, contrary to Policies DMHB 11 and DMHB 18 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
