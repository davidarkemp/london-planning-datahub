    "The trees are located between 31 and 33 Gibson Road, Ickenham. They can be viewed from both of these properties, from properties on Campden Road, and also by passing vehicle and foot traffic on Gibson Road. The trees, are currently in a moderate condition and due to their location have a moderate amenity value.",
    "This application has been refused due to the lack of technical information provided. The initial reason for the felling of the trees (to facilitate the building of a fence) is not considered a valid arboricultural reason. A secondary reason was provided (suspected ash die-back within the ash, and co-dominant stems with included bark on the eucalyptus), but no technical evidence was provided to support this claim.",

    "The removal of deadwood, dangerous / hanging branches and ivy:  This does not require the formal consent of the Council.",

Therefore, if applicable, it is advisable to consult your tree surgeon / consultant to agree an acceptable time for carrying out the approved works.",
    "Owner(s)'s permission:  Permission should be sought from the owner(s) of the tree(s) and / or the owner(s) of the land that the tree(s) overhang prior to any approved work being carried out.",
    "Expected standard of tree work: The approved works must be carried out in accordance with the conditions laid out above. If they are not, then enforcement action could being taken which could lead to prosecution and heavy fines. Therefore, it is highly recommended that the works are only carried out by a professional and competent arboriculturist who undertakes to comply with the conditions of this consent and in accordance with industry best practice (BS 3998:2010). The Arboricultural Association can provide details of its approved contractors, who have demonstrated such professionalism and competence, on their website (www.trees.org.uk) or by calling 01242 522152. Or on request the Council can provide a list of contractors who are known to carry out tree work to a good standard and to normally maintain an appropriate policy of indemnity insurance."
