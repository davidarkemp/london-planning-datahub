    "The Beech tree (T1 on TPO 721) is situated to the side of The Lakes, Belfry Avenue. This prominent tree can be viewed from nearby properties on Belfry Avenue and passing vehicle and foot traffic. The tree is highly visible in its surroundings, is mature and in a fair condition giving it a high amenity value.",
    "This application has been refused on the grounds that insufficient technical evidence has been provided to prove that there is a major cavity with less than 30% holding wood present at the base. Some photos have been provided, but these show what appears to be small, localised cavities on one root and part of the stem (not fully visible from picture provided). We would expect to see clear photographic evidence or decay detection data to support this claim.",
    "Having regard to the reasons given for the proposed work, the work is unjustified and will have a detrimental impact on the visual amenity and arboreal character of the area.",
    "The removal of deadwood, dangerous / hanging branches and ivy:  This does not require the formal consent of the Council.",
    "Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981:  Note that it is an offence under this act to disturb roosting bats, nesting birds or any other protected species.  Therefore, if applicable, it is advisable to consult your tree surgeon / consultant to agree an acceptable time for carrying out the approved works.",
    "Owner(s)'s permission:  Permission should be sought from the owner(s) of the tree(s) and / or the owner(s) of the land that the tree(s) overhang prior to any approved work being carried out.",
    "Expected standard of tree work: The approved works must be carried out in accordance with the conditions laid out above. If they are not, then enforcement action could being taken which could lead to prosecution and heavy fines. Therefore, it is highly recommended that the works are only carried out by a professional and competent arboriculturist who undertakes to comply with the conditions of this consent and in accordance with industry best practice (BS 3998:2010). The Arboricultural Association can provide details of its approved contractors, who have demonstrated such professionalism and competence, on their website (www.trees.org.uk) or by calling 01242 522152. Or on request the Council can provide a list of contractors who are known to carry out tree work to a good standard and to normally maintain an appropriate policy of indemnity insurance."
