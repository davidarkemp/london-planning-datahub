    "The development, by reason of its siting and design would inhibit the effective delivery, design, layout and planning of the Annington Homes Site Allocation (Policy SA 27 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 - Site Allocations and Designations) and would consequently inhibit the provision of an appropriate quantum of homes that makes effective use of a strategically important site. The development would therefore be contrary to the aims of Policy SA 27 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 - Site Allocations and Designations; Policy H1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2: Development Management Policies (2020); Policies GG2, D3 and H1 of the London Plan; and Paragraphs 128 and 129 of the NPPF 2023.",
    "The siting, layout and form of the development would fail to respond appropriately to character and appearance of the street scene and surrounding built form and would prejudice the future design quality and layout of the adjoining Annington Homes Site Allocation.",
    "The development would be contrary to Policies DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the The Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020); Policy SA 27 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 - Ste Allocations and Designations; Policy BE1 of the The Local Plan: Part 2 - Site Allocations and Designations (2020); Policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan; and the NPPF 2023 in particular Paragraphs 135 and 139.",
    "The proposals would result in a net loss of on-site biodiversity and would therefore fail to achieve the required 10% net gain in biodiversity and in the absence of a completed legal agreement to secure off-site delivery of biodiversity net gain the development would be contrary to Schedule 7A of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990; Policy DMEI 7 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 Development Management Policies; Policy G6 of the London Plan; and Paragraphs 180, 185 and 186 of the NPPF 2023.",
    "The submitted plans fail to achieve compliance with the M4(2) technical specifications set out in Approved Document M to the Building Regulations (2015 edition) and consequently the development would fail to achieve adequate, inclusive and accessible standards of design for future occupiers and would be contrary to Policies D5, D6 and D7 of the London Plan; Policy DMHB 16 of the The Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020); and the NPPF 2023 in particular Paragraph 135.",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2016). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service."
