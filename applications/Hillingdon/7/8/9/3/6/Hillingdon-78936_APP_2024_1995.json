    "The proposed development is within Flood Zone 3B (functional floodplain) and within 8m of a watercourse. In this location the development would restrict essential maintenance and emergency access to the watercourse. Furthermore the submitted FRA fails to demonstrate that the development will be safe for its users for the intended lifetime of the development, without increasing flood risk elsewhere, or that it would be sufficiently flood resistant and resilient to the level and nature of flood risk to the site. Taking into consideration these points the development is considered to be contrary to Policy EM6 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policy DMEI 8 and DMEI 9 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies, Policy SI12 of the London Plan (2021) and Chapter 14 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021)."
