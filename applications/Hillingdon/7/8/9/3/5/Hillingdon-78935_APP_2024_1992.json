    "REASON: The partial change of use of the ground floor commercial space to ancillary residential space would erode the quality of commercial Class E space on offer which would affect its overall marketability and thereby having detrimental impact on the  function and vitality of the primary retail shopping area of Ruislip Town Centre. The proposal therefore conflicts with Policy E5 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One -",
    "Strategic Policies (2012), Policies DMTC 1 and  DMTC 2  of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy SD6 of the London Plan and Chapter 7 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023).",
    "The proposal by reason of its siting, scale, massing and design of the proposed development would result in an overdevelopment of the site and an incongruous addition that would fail to harmonise with the character and architectural composition of the Locally Listed Building, as well as failing to preserve the character and appearance of the Ruislip Village Conservation Area. The proposal therefore conflicts with Policies BE1 and HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012), Policies DMHB 1, DMHB 3, DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policies HC1, D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021) and the NPPF (2023).",
    "The development would fail to provide a high quality internal amenity space, in terms of layout, outlook, privacy and security, resulting in harm to residential amenity and unsatisfactory living conditions for the occupiers. In addition, in the absence of sufficient information to support the BRE daylight and sunlight assessment the application has failed to demonstrate that the proposed development would provide adequate Daylight and Sunlight to future residents. The proposal therefore fails to comply with Policy DMHB  15 and16 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy D3 and D6 of the London Plan (2021) and the NPPF (2023).",
    "The proposal by virtue of its size, scale, fenestration and proximity, would be detrimental to the amenities of the neighbouring occupiers at 80a High Street and the Thomas Moore residential building by reason of noise, disturbance, loss of outlook and sense of enclosure and by reason of loss of visual intrusion, loss of privacy and perceived overlooking, respectively. Furthermore, in the absence of sufficient information to support the BRE daylight and sunlight assessment the application has failed to demonstrate that the proposed development would not lead to a loss of light or significant overshadowing to both adjoining neighbouring properties. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012), Policy DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2023).",
    "The proposed development is located within the LBH Air Quality Management Area, and within the Ruislip Town Centre Focus Area. No appropriate mitigation was offered by the applicant and therefore the proposed development is contrary to local and regional policies, Policy DMEI 14: Air Quality , London Borough of Hillingdon Air Quality Action Plan and the London Plan, Policy SI1.",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan (2021) and national guidance.",
    "This is a reminder that Under the terms of the Planning Act 2008 (as amended) and Community Infrastructure Levy Regulations 2010 (as amended), should an application for appeal be allowed, the proposed development would be deemed as 'chargeable development' and therefore liable to pay the London Borough of Hillingdon Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and the Mayor of London's Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This would be calculated in accordance with the London Borough of Hillingdon CIL Charging Schedule 2014 and the Mayor of London's CIL Charging Schedule 2012.",
