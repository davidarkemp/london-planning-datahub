    "The intensity of external illumination of the sign advertisement(s) shall not exceed 300 cd/m2.",
    "REASON",
    "To ensure that the brightness of the proposed advertisement(s) will not have an adverse effect on the amenities of the area and to avoid distraction to passing motorists in accordance with Policies DMHB 4, DMHB 11, DMHB 13A and DMT 2 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "The illumination of the sign(s) is to be by fixed and constant lights and not by lights which are, or appear to be, intermittent, moving, flashing or vibrating.",

    "The decision to GRANT advertisement consent has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan (2021) and national guidance.",
    "The external illumination units would oversail the adopted highway, therefore, the applicant may need to apply for a license to oversail the highway in accordance with The Highways Act 1980 section 177.",
    "This advertisement consent relates solely to the installation of 3 no. externally illuminated fascia signs. Full Planning Permission is required for the internal and external works to the shopfront, including the installation of kitchen extraction system and installation of AC condenser unit to the rear."
