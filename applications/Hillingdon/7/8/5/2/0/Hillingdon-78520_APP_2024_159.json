    "A. Demolition and construction works which are audible at the site boundary shall only be carried out between the hours of 08.00 and 18.00 hours Monday to Friday and between the hours of 08.00 hours and 13.00 hours on Saturday.

    "It is considered that a condition based on fixed noise levels is consistent with noise and planning policy by relating external noise levels to the point at which adverse effects on health and quality of life start to be observed. The limit values are intended to be consistent with the evidence base that formed the bases for the guidelines published by the WHO in 1999 and 2009 the former being reflected in guidance: 'Guidance on Sound Insulation and Noise Reduction for Buildings' BS8233 2014. This is combined with the assessment principles and procedures detailed in guidance: 'Methods for rating and assessing industrial and commercial sound' British Standards Institution BS4142 2014.' This is used to set reference time periods for the assessment and adjust measured or calculated LAeq values for character as detailed in BS4142.",
    "The proposed plan does not currently include any WC provision for disabled people and at least one accessible unisex toilet should be provided. As building works to construct new and revised toilet facilities are planned, the opportunity to incorporate accessible toilet provision is advised. The accessible toilet should be designed in accordance with the guidance given in Approved Document M to the Building Regulations 2010 (2015 edition).",
    "The Equality Act 2010 seeks to protect people accessing goods, facilities and services from discrimination on the basis of a 'protected characteristic', which includes those with a disability. As part of the Act, service providers are obliged to improve access to and within the structure of their building, particularly in situations where reasonable adjustment can be incorporated with relative ease. The Act states that service providers should think ahead to take steps to address barriers that impede disabled people.",
