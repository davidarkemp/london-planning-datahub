  "description": "Change of use from a 5-bedroom residential property (Class C3) to an 8 bedroom HMO (Sui Generis) with associated amendments to front garden and car parking.",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed change of use from a residential dwelling to a large HMO, by reason of the loss of an existing family unit as well as the resulting noise and disturbance, both in terms of the use and additional comings and goings generated with 8 separate occupant units (and potentially up to 11 occupants) compared to a single family unit, would be unacceptable in terms of principle of development and would result in harm to the residential amenity of neighbouring occupiers along Warren Road. In addition, given the intensification of the site and by reason of its situation within an area with a PTAL ranking of 1B, the proposed change of use would result in more trips being generated meaning the site would not be considered to be sustainably located. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies BE1 and EM8 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012), Policies DMH 2, DMH 5 and DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), a",
    "The proposed HMO use would provide inadequate internal communal space to accommodate the proposed increase in the number of occupants, coupled with an inadequately sized kitchen. Moreover, the application fails to demonstrate that noise transfer between the communal kitchen and ground floor HMO rooms could be adequately controlled, in order to provide a suitable level of acoustic amenity for the future occupant(s) together with poor level of privacy for the front facing HMOs rooms, collectively, these issues would result in a substandard form of accommodation for future occupants, contrary to Section 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023), Policies D6 and D14 of the London Plan (2021) and Policies DMH 5, DMHB 11 and DMHB 16 of the Hillingdon Local Plan - Part 2: Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The proposal would fail to provide acceptable pedestrian, cycle and vehicular access to the application site which due to the increased number of vehicular movements in combination with the gate in close proximity to the highway would result in danger and inconvenience which fails to concur with the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020), Policies DMT 1, DMT 2 and DMT 6 and Policies T2, T4 and T5 of the London Plan (2021) and NPPF (2023).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal.",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan (2021) and national guidance.",
