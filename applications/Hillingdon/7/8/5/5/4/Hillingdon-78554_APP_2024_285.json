  "description": "Erection of a single storey rear extension and a part single part two storey side and rear extension, along with a first floor side extension above existing attached garage. Erection of a front porch, conversion of garage space into habitable space including fenestration. conversion of loft space into habitable space to include arear dormer, hip to gable end conversation and 1 No. additional roof light.",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed hip to gable conversion, large rear dormer together with the two storey side/rear extension, by reason of their cumulative size, scale, bulk, height and design (including the proposed relationship with the gable and hipped two-storey side), would result in a disproportionate, visually obtrusive and incongrous form of development that would be detrimental to the appearance of the original host dwelling, and would cause harm to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the existing street scene. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2021), Policies DMHD 1 and DMHB 11 and  of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management (2020), Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021) and Chapter 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "a) We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal.",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination)."
