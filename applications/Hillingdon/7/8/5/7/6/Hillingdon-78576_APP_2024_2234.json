    "In the absence of sufficient justification, the proposal involves the loss of employment floorspace within a Locally Significant Employment Location, thereby reducing the availability of flexible, accessible and attractive employment floorspace in the borough, contrary to Section 6 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2023, Policies E2 and E4 of the London Plan 2021, Policies E1 and E6 of the Hillingdon Local Plan (Part 1) 2012 and Policy DME 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan (Part 2) 2020.",
    "The development would fail to provide an acceptable standard of onsite residential accommodation for future occupiers by reason of insufficient outdoor amenity space, poor visual outlook from the bedroom, lack of defensible space and visual intrusion to the bedroom, poor daylight access and ventilation to the proposed living room, and substandard location of the waste storage. as such, the proposal exhibits a substandard level of amenity and poor residential environment, detrimental to the living standards of future occupants. This is contrary to Section 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2023, Policies D3 and D6 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies DMHB 16, DMHB 18 and DMEI 14 of the Hillingdon Local Plan (Part 2) 2020.",

We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service. As the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies, it is not considered negotiation could overcome the reasons for refusal.",
