    "Due to its uncharacteristic design, height and excessive site coverage, the new dwelling would form a cramped, unduly prominent and visually incongruous addition to the street scene which would be harmful to the character and appearance of the area. For the same reasons the development would be out of keeping with the established urban grain and pattern of development in the local area, harming the areas character. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), Policies D3, D4 and D6 of the London Plan (2021) and paragraph 130 of the NPPF (2021).",
    "The new dwelling would fail to meet the requirements for a M4(2) accessible and adaptable dwelling as set out in Approved Document M to the Building Regulations (2015 edition), contrary to Policy D7 of the London Plan (2023).",
    "Due to its poor design, layout and inadequate provision of internal floorspace, the proposed dwelling would provide a cramped and substandard internal living accommodation for its future residents to their detriment of their amenities. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy DMHB 16 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies and Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "The first floor rear windows of the new dwelling would provide close range views into the habitable rear windows and garden of No.14 Hayes End Drive. The views would cause excessive overlooking and a harmful loss of privacy to residents of the property to the detriment of their amenities. Additionally, due to its height, depth and position, the new dwelling would cause a significant loss of outlook from the garden of No.16 Hayes End Drive, appearing as an oppressive and overbearing building harming the amenities of the property's occupiers. The dwelling would also cause undue overshadowing to the external amenity space of No.16, discouraging its use and further harming the amenities of the property's occupiers. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies and paragraph 130(f) of the NPPF (2023).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan (2021).",
    "This is a reminder that Under the terms of the Planning Act 2008 (as amended) and Community Infrastructure Levy Regulations 2010 (as amended), should an application for appeal be allowed, the proposed development would be deemed as 'chargeable development' and therefore liable to pay the London Borough of Hillingdon Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and the Mayor of London's Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This would be calculated in accordance with the London Borough of Hillingdon CIL Charging Schedule 2014 and the Mayor of London's CIL Charging Schedule 2012.",
    "For more information on CIL matters please visit the planning portal page at: www.planningportal.gov.uk/planning/applications/howtoapply/whattosubmit/cil",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service. We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
