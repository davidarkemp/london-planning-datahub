    "The proposal, including the proposed basement, by virtue of its design, scale and excavation would appear as an unduly dominant and incongruous form of development and would cause harm to the character and appearance of the host dwelling and site landscape, the visual amenity of the street scene, and the character of the Gatehill Farm Estate Area of Special Local Character. Therefore, the proposal fails to comply with Policies HE1 and BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One Strategic (2012), Policies DMHB 5, DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and Policy DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and Sections 12 and 16 of the National Planning Policy Framework.",
    "The Basement Impact Assessment which has been submitted in support of the application is inadequate and fails to demonstrate that the development would not have an unacceptable impact on drainage, flooding, groundwater conditions and structural stability. A site investigation is required to ensure no groundwater is found on site. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy DMHD 3 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020) and Policy SI 12 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service. We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
