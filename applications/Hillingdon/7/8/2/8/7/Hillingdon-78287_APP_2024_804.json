    "The proposed development constitutes permitted development by virtue of the provisions of Schedule 2, Part 14, Class J of the of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended). Prior approval is required and is granted as the Council has assessed the impact of the proposal and considers that there would be no unacceptable impact with regard to the design or external appearance of the development, in particular the impact of glare on occupiers of neighbouring land, subject to compliance with the stated conditions.",
