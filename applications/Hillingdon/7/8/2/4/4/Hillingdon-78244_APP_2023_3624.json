    "The development, by reason of its width, siting, and size, would be harmful to the character and appearance of the host dwelling; result in a cramped form of development that erodes the characteristic corner gap between properties on Paddock Road; and harm the character, appearance and visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area. The development is therefore contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012), and Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service."
