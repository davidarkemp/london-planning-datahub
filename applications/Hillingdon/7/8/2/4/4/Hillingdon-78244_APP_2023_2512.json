As part of the dwellinghouse would, as a result of the works, extend beyond the plane of any existing roof slope which forms the principal elevation of the dwellinghouse and fronts a highway, which in this case would be Paddock Road. Also, the proposed circular windows on the side elevations are not shown to be non-opening unless the parts of the window which can be opened are more than 1.7 metres above the floor of the room in which the window is installed."
