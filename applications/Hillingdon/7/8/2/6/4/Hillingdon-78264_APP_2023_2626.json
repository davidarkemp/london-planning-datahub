    "The proposal, by reason of introduction of railings and a roof terrace at eaves level along the road frontage would appear as an unduly incongruous feature in this traditional residential street scene and its use would be detrimental to its character, contrary to Policy BE1 of the Local Plan: Part One (2012) and Policies DMHB 11 and 12 of the  Local Plan: Part Two (2020).",
    "The proposal fails to demonstrate that the neighbouring properties within the existing block would not be would not be adversely impacted by the loss of sunlight and daylight, detrimental to their residential amenity, contrary to Policy D6 of the London Plan and Policy DMHB 11 of the Local Plan: Part Two (2020).",
    "The proposed access and parking arrangements would result in the inappropriate intensification of use of the existing substandard undercroft vehicular access and would fail to provide adequate manoeuvring space to allow ease of access to the two new parking spaces in front of the building. As such, the proposal, would give rise to vehicular and pedestrian conflict within the site and on the adjoining public highway, restricting the free flow of traffic and causing obstruction to the detriment of highway safety, contrary to Policies T2 and T4 of the London Plan (2021) and Policies DMT 1 and DMT 2 of the Local Plan: Part Two (2020).",
    "The proposal would result in the provision of substandard residential accommodation, as it fails to provide an appropriate amount of private amenity space for the new units, to the detriment of the amenities of future occupants and contrary to Policy DMHB 18 of the of the Local Plan: Part Two (2020).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan - The Spatial Development Strategy for London consolidated with alterations since 2011 (2016) and national guidance.",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service. We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal.",
    "This is a reminder that Under the terms of the Planning Act 2008 (as amended) and Community Infrastructure Levy Regulations 2010 (as amended), should an application for appeal be allowed, the proposed development would be deemed as 'chargeable development' and therefore liable to pay the London Borough of Hillingdon Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and the Mayor of London's Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This would be calculated in accordance with the London Borough of Hillingdon CIL Charging Schedule 2014 and the Mayor of London's CIL Charging Schedule 2012.",
