    "The proposed advertisement by reason of its size, siting and design would have a significant harmful impact on the visual amenities of the surrounding area, creating advertising clutter where none exists at present and degrading the visual quality of the area and open Green Belt setting. The proposal is therefore contrary to the Council's adopted policies, in particular Policies BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 13A and DMEI 4 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service."
