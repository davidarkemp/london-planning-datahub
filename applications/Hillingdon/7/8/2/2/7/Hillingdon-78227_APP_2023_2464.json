    "The Local Planning Authority considers that the applicants have failed to provide robust evidence to demonstrate that other more suitable and less harmful sites do not exist, and that they have actively explored the possibility of erecting the proposed telecommunications equipment on existing buildings, masts or other structures. The development would therefore be contrary to paragraphs 115 and 117 c) of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), and Policy DMHB 21 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The proposed telecommunications street pole and associated equipment would, by virtue of their prominent position, size, scale, bulk and height, represent an over dominant, prominent and incongruous feature in the street scene that would cause visual intrusion and significant harm to the character and appearance of the area. Furthermore, the proposed cabinets and associated equipment are located within a close proximity to trees subject to a TPO and no arboricultural method statement or survey has been provided to demonstrate that the trees would be unaffected by the development. The trees provide a significant contribution to the character and appearance of the street, therefore could have a detrimental impact on the visual amenities of the area. The development would therefore be contrary to paragraphs 115 and 130 c) of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies D4, D8 and SI6 of the London Plan (2021), Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One- Strategic Policie"
