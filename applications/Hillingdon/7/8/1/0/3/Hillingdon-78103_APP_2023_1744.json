    "The proposed development would result in adjoining HMO uses on The Greenway. The over concentration of HMO uses on the street frontage would cause harm to the character of this residential area within the Greenway Conservation Area. The proposal is therefore considered to be contrary to Policies DMH 5 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The proposed development, on account of the lack of outlook and cramped nature of Room 5, as well as the lack of privacy to Room 1, would result in a poor standard of accommodation for future residents to the detriment of their amenities. The proposal is therefore considered to be contrary to Policies DMH 5 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021), as well as paragraph 130 (f) of the NPPF (2021).",
    "The proposed development, in the absence of a usable and functional parking layout, would lead to roadside parking which would hinder vehicle movements in the area leading to traffic build up to the detriment of the highways network, creating a more hazardous environment for pedestrians and vehicle users contrary to Policies DMT 2 and DMT 6 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), as well as policy T4 of the London Plan and paragraph 112 (c) of the NPPF (2021).",
