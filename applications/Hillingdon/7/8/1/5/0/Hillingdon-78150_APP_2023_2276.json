    "The proposed development, by reason of its cumulative width, size, scale, bulk and design, would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original properties and would be detrimental to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the surrounding area.

    "The proposed layout, in particular, Bedroom 2 for Nos. 18 and 20 Wilmar Close at first floor, would fail to provide an adequate outlook resulting in poor quality and substandard accommodation for future occupiers of the dwellings. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy DMHB 11 and 16 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020) as well as Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021).",

We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",

In addition further guidance was offered to the applicant by the case officer during the processing of the application to identify the amendments to address those elements of the scheme considered unacceptable which the applicant chose not to implement."
