    "The proposed development, by reason of its cumulative size, scale, bulk and massing and design, would result in an excessive, bulky, incongruous, dominant and visually intrusive form of development that would substantially harm the form, proportion and appearance of the existing dwelling and would be detrimental to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One Strategic Policies (2012), Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021) and Paragraph 135b of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023).",
    "The proposed development fails to demonstrate that the site could safely accommodate an adequate level of off-street car parking provision to comply with the adopted car parking standards et out in Appendix C Table 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020). The proposed development would result in an increase in parking pressure on local streets, which would cause inconsiderate and illegal parking to the detriment of the safety and convenience of existing residents and roads users. The proposal would therefore cause harm to highway safety, contrary to Policies DMT 1, DMT 2 and DMT 6 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and Paragraph 115 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023).",
    "The proposed development, by virtue of its failure to maintain an adequate provision of private external amenity space, would have a harmful effect on the living conditions of the occupants of the host property. The development would therefore be contrary to Policies",
    "DMHB 18 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and Paragraph 135f of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2021). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal.",
    "This is a reminder that Under the terms of the Planning Act 2008 (as amended) and Community Infrastructure Levy Regulations 2010 (as amended), should an application for appeal be allowed, the proposed development would be deemed as 'chargeable development' and therefore liable to pay the London Borough of Hillingdon Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and the Mayor of London's Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This would be calculated in accordance with the London Borough of Hillingdon CIL Charging Schedule 2014 and the Mayor of London's CIL Charging Schedule 2012.
