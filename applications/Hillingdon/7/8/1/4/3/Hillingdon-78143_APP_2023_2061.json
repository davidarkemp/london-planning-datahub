    "The proposed development, by reason of its scale, height, width, depth, roof form and design, would result in an excessive, bulky, incongruous, dominant and visually intrusive form of development that would substantially harm the form, proportion and appearance of the existing dwelling and would be detrimental to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One Strategic Policies (2012),  Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) , Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The proposed development fails to demonstrate that the site could safely accommodate an adequate level of off-street car parking provision to comply with the adopted car parking standards set out in Appendix C Table 1 of the  Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020). The proposed development would result in an increase in parking pressure on local streets, which would cause inconsiderate and illegal parking to the detriment of the safety and convenience of existing residents and roads users. The proposal would therefore cause harm to highway safety, contrary to Policies DMT 1, DMT 2 and DMT 6  of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and paragraph 111 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan (2021) and national guidance.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service. We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
