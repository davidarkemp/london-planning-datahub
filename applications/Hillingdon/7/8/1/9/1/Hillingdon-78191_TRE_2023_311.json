    "T1 and T2 and T3 (G9 on TPO 124) 135 Knoll Crescent, Northwood are mature trees that appear in good health and are prominent within landscape of Knoll Crescent. They have moderate to high amenity value, and make a contribution to the arboreal character of the area.",

Raising the crown to this height will mean that primary branches would be removed, leading to large pruning wounds, which could in turn lead to infection and the long term decline of the tree. The proposal to fell T3 is unacceptable, as poor form and a lifting patio is not considered as a valid arboricultural reason to remove the tree.",
