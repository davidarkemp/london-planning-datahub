    "The constructed boundary treatment, by reason of materials and design which exacerbates its siting, scale, bulk, impact and appearance, would form an uncharacteristic and incongruous addition to the area, which would fail to integrate with street scene and the wider area. The proposal would therefore be detrimental to the visual amenity and character of the surrounding area, contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020)."
