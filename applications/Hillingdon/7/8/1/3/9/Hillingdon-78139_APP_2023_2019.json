    "The proposed development, by reason of the reduced rear garden size, would be detrimental to the amenity of the current and future occupiers of 66 Churchill Road, and would give rise to a substandard form of accommodation, by reason of loss of significant private amenity space and uncharacteristically small rear garden. As such, the proposal would be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One Strategic Policies (2012) and Policies DMHD 1, DMHB 11 and DMHB 18 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020)."
