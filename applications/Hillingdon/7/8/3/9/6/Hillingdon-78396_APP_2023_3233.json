    "The proposed development, by reason of the design and excessive size, scale and bulk of the hip to gable and rear dormer would result in an incongruous and visually obtrusive form of development which would fail to respect the architectural composition of the original dwelling and would be detrimental to the character and appearance of the street scene and surrounding area. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012),  Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policies D1, D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021)."
