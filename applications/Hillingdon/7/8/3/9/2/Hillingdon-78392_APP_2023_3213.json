    "The proposed development, by reason of its scale would fail to provide an ancillary function to the main dwelling and is therefore considered to be capable of independent occupation from the main dwelling. As a result, the proposal would be tantamount to a separate self-contained residential unit in a position where such a dwelling would be unacceptable. Consequently, the proposed development would harm the character and appearance of the area, fail to provide acceptable living conditions for prospective occupants of the outbuilding, and harm the amenity of neighbouring occupants/residents. The proposal is, therefore, contrary to Policies DMHD 2 and DMHB 11 of the  Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policies D3 and D6 of the London Plan (2021), and Chapter 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
