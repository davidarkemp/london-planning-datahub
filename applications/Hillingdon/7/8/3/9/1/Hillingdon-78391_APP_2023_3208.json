    "The proposed single storey rear extension, by reason of its size, scale, bulk, depth and positioning, would be excessive and disproportionate to the original dwelling and would not appear as a subordinate addition. The proposal would therefore be detrimental to the character and appearance of the original dwelling, contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One Strategic (2012) and Policies DMDH 1, DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The proposed single storey rear extension, by reason of its size, scale, bulk, depth and positioning, is detrimental to the amenities of the neighbouring occupiers at Number 107 The Larches by reason of overshadowing and loss of daylight and sunlight to the rear garden and rear facing windows and loss of outlook from and dominance to habitable rooms contrary to Policies DMHD 1 and DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan (2021) and national guidance."
