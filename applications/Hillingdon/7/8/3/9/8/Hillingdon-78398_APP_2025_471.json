  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposal would result in the loss of the mature tree located on the rear of the site, and by reason of its proximity to a neighbouring mature tree, could cause undue harm to the adjacent mature tree. The applicant has not submitted sufficient details to asses the proposal's impact on these trees of merit or mitigation to offset the harm. The proposal therefore conflicts with Policy G7 of the London Plan (2021) and Policy DMHB 14 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "In the absence of a sufficient BRE daylight and sunlight assessment, the application has failed to demonstrate that the proposed development would not unduly restrict access to daylight and sunlight of neighbouring residential dwellings at 177A, 177B, and 181A Field End Road, which would harm their residential amenity. The proposal therefore fails to comply with Paragraph 135 of the NPPF (2024), Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021), and Policy DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The proposal by virtue of its size, scale, fenestration, and proximity, would be detrimental to the amenities of the neighbouring occupiers at 177A, 177B, 179A, and 181A Field End Road. The proposal would result in an unacceptable loss of outlook, sense of enclosure, and reduced privacy/sense of privacy for the neighbouring residential units. The proposal would therefore be contrary to  Paragraph 135 of the NPPF (2024), Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021), and Policy DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020.",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan (2021) and national guidance."
