    "The proposed single storey rear extension by virtue of its excessive size, scale, bulk, depth and proximity, would be detrimental to the amenities of the neighbouring occupier at No.2 and No.6 Clevedon Gardens, by reason of overdominance, overshadowing, visual intrusion, loss of light and loss of outlook. Therefore, the proposal would be contrary to Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The rear extension, by reason of its excessive bulk, siting, scale, massing and design visually incongruous and unsympathetic to the original architectural composition of the host dwelling, resulting in the proposed development having a harmful impact to original dwelling, and the character, appearance and visual amenities of the area.  The proposal would therefore conflict with Paragraph 135b) of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023), Policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021), Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One Strategic Policies (2012) and Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020)."
