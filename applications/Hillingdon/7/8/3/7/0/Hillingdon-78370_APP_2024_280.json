    "Due to its size, location, design, layout and siting the proposed dwelling and associated development would form an uncharacteristic, unduly prominent and visually incongruous development which would fail to harmonise with the local character and appearance of the surrounding area. The proposal is therefore detrimental to the visual amenity and character of the surrounding area, contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012), Policies DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policies D1, D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021) and Paragraph 135 of the NPPF (2023).",
    "The site is subject to a Tree Preservation Area Order (TPO 359). The Applicant has failed to demonstrate with an appropriate arboricultural method statement and tree protection plan that existing landscaping, trees, biodiversity or other natural features of merit on and adjacent to the site would be retained, protected or enhanced. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy DMHB 14 of the Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and Policy G7 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan (2021) and NPPF (2023).",
    "This is a reminder that Under the terms of the Planning Act 2008 (as amended) and Community Infrastructure Levy Regulations 2010 (as amended), should an application for appeal be allowed, the proposed development would be deemed as 'chargeable development' and therefore liable to pay the London Borough of Hillingdon Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and the Mayor of London's Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This would be calculated in accordance with the London Borough of Hillingdon CIL Charging Schedule 2014 and the Mayor of London's CIL Charging Schedule 2012.
