    "Due to its size, location, design, layout and siting the proposed dwelling and associated development would form a cramped, uncharacteristic, unduly prominent and visually incongruous development which would fail to harmonise with the local character and appearance of the surrounding area. The proposal is therefore detrimental to the visual amenity and character of the surrounding area, contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies, Policies DMH 6, DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policies D1, D3 and D6 of the London Plan (2021), as well as paragraphs 71, 124 and 130 of the NPPF (2021).",
    "The first floor bedroom window within the new dwelling would provide views toward the front elevation windows of No.19A Rutters Close. Due to the position of the window and its close proximity to the mentioned neighbour, the proposed development would cause excessive overlooking and a significant loss of privacy to the detriment of the neighbours amenities and living conditions. The proposal is therefore considered to be contrary to Policies DMH 6 and DMHB 11, of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021), and paragraph 130 (f) of the NPPF (2021).",
    "Due to its location, layout and proposed parking arrangement, the proposed development would lead to cars reversing onto a busy junction, which would reduce pedestrian and road user safety whilst also leading to traffic build up on the local highways network. The proposal would therefore result in a more dangerous highways network, contrary to Policies DMT 1, DMT 2, DMT 5 and DMT 6 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), as well as policies T2, T4 and T6 of the London Plan (2021) and paragraph 111 of the NPPF (2021).",
    "The Applicant has failed to demonstrate with an appropriate tree survey, the location, height, spread and species of trees on and adjacent to the site which are subject to a Tree Preservation Order. Without this information, the applications fails to demonstrate the development would retain or enhance existing landscaping, trees, biodiversity or other natural features of merit, all contrary to Policies DMHB14 of the Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and the NPPF.",
    "The proposed dwelling would fail to meet the requirements for a M4(2) accessible and adaptable dwelling as set out in Approved Document M to the Building Regulations (2015 edition). The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy D7 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan (2021) and NPPF (2021).",
    "This is a reminder that Under the terms of the Planning Act 2008 (as amended) and Community Infrastructure Levy Regulations 2010 (as amended), should an application for appeal be allowed, the proposed development would be deemed as 'chargeable development' and therefore liable to pay the London Borough of Hillingdon Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and the Mayor of London's Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This would be calculated in accordance with the London Borough of Hillingdon CIL Charging Schedule 2014 and the Mayor of London's CIL Charging Schedule 2012.",
