    "The proposed outbuilding by reason of its design, massing and prominent siting along the boundary with the ground flat garden would result in an overly dominant and visually obtrusive form of development which would be out of keeping with the pattern of development in the area, to the detriment of the character and appearance of the surrounding area. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies D3, D4 and G7 of the London Plan (2021), Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHD1; DMHB 11, DMHB14 and DMHD 2  of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - (2020).",

    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan (2021) and national guidance."
