    "The proposed roof extension and terrace, by virtue of its scale, siting and design, would result in incongruous additions to the host building when viewed from the street scene and would be out of character with the surrounding area, which lies within the Hillingdon Court Park Area of Special Local Character. As such, the proposed development conflicts with Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012) and Policies DMHB 5, DMHB 11, and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management (2020).",
    "The proposed roof terrace, by virtue of its size, position, and proximity, would be detrimental to the amenities of the adjoining occupiers at 2, 6 and 8 Chestwood Grove by reason of noise, disturbance, overlooking, and loss of privacy. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policies DMHD 1 and DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
