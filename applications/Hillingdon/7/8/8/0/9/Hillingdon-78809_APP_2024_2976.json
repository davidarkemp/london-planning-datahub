    "The location and amount of development proposed would result in a harmful loss of garden land, thereby harming the character and appearance of the area. The principle of intensifying residential use involving the loss of existing private gardens is unacceptable in principle. The proposal is, therefore, contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2024), Policies D3 and H2 of the London Plan (2021), Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012), and Policies DMH 6 and DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The location and development of up to four flats, as potentially enabled under this Permission in Principle application, would result in the over-proliferation of flats within the area, contributing to a variety of harm, including congestion on roads, the loss of garden space, reductions in privacy, significant changes to the street scene, and loss of family accommodation. The principle of establishing flats on the site is considered to be unacceptable in principle. The proposal is, therefore, contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2024), Policies D3 and H2 of the London Plan (2021), Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012), and Policies DMH 4 and DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020)."
