    "The proposed development, by reason of its siting, size, scale, bulk, layout, and site coverage, would result in a cramped development of the site, which is visually incongruous and would fail to harmonise with the existing local context of the surrounding area. The proposal would be detrimental to the visual amenity, character and appearance of the site and surrounding area, contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 (2012), Policies DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 (2020), Policies D3 and D6 of the London Plan (2021) and Chapter 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023).",
    "The site is capable of facilitating a family sized unit and by reason of the proposed unit mix fails to provide sufficient family sized units, as required by the latest information on housing need in the Borough. The proposed development fails to contribute towards mixed and balanced communities and the range of housing types required within the Borough contrary to Policy DMH 2 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 (2020), Policy H10 of the London Plan (2021) and Chapter 5 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023).",
    "The proposed development, by reason of the garden size, would be detrimental to the amenity of the future occupiers, and would give rise to a substandard form of accommodation. As such, the proposal would be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One Strategic Policies (2012) and Policies DMHB 11 and DMHB 18 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The proposal would fail to provide adequate floorspace for Units 1 and 2 with both units failing to meet minimum floorspace standard. Furthermore, the habitable rooms proposed for Building 1 (Units 1, 2, 3 and 4) are also single aspect with access to limited outlook, daylight and sunlight, either facing to the North (with limited access to light), East towards a boundary fence (circa 0.85m away) or South towards Building 1 (circa 4m away). These units would constitute substandard forms of living accommodation to the detriment of the amenity of future occupiers, contrary to Policy DMHB 16 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy D6 and Table 3.1 of the London Plan (2021), the Mayor of London's adopted Supplementary Planning Guidance - Housing (March 2016) and the Technical Housing Standards - Nationally Described Space Standard (March 2015). Further, the non-compliance identified cannot be resolved by planning condition.",
    "Insufficient information has been submitted to demonstrate that both the flats proposed and neighbouring residential properties would receive sufficient daylight and sunlight to accord with the guidelines set out within the 'Site layout planning for daylight and sunlight: a guide to good practice' (BR209) report. The development is likely to give rise to a substandard form of living accommodation to the detriment of the amenity of future occupiers and neighbouring residents, contrary to Policy DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021) and the Mayor of London's adopted Supplementary Planning Guidance - Housing (March 2016).",
    "In the absence of a Tree Survey and Arboricultural Impact Assessment, the application has failed to confirm the species and category/quality of trees to be removed as part of the proposals. The application has also failed to demonstrate that all other trees would be protected and retained. Accordingly, the development could result in adverse and irreversible impacts to landscaping, trees, biodiversity or other natural features of merit, detrimental to the visual amenities of the area, contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 (2012) and Policies DMHB 11 and DMHB 14 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 (2020).",
    "In the absence of sufficient biodiversity information, it has not been demonstrated that the proposal would deliver at least a 10% increase in biodiversity value relative to the pre-development biodiversity value of the onsite habitat. The development fails to deliver a biodiversity net gain within the borough and fails to secure the protection and effective management of the remaining habitat on site. As such, the proposal is contrary to Schedule 7A of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 and the Environment Act 2021, Policy G6 of the London Plan 2021, Policy EM7 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012), and Policies DMEI 7 and DMHB 14 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two (2020).",
    "The proposed development would likely contribute to the production of unacceptable pollutant emissions in the Hillingdon Air Quality Management Area and the A40 / South Ruislip Air Quality Focus Area. In the absence of an Air Quality Assessment, it is not possible to ascertain the full measure of transport emissions into the atmosphere and whether the proposed development would be air quality neutral. Further, the proposed development is not air quality positive and there are insufficient measures proposed to mitigate the total emissions. Furthermore, the Applicant has failed to secure Section 106 planning obligations required to mitigate the harm and demands created by the development in respect of air quality. The development therefore conflicts with Policy EM8 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 (2012, Policies DMEI 14 and DMCI 7 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2,  Policies SI 1 and DF1  of the London Plan (2021) and paragraphs 55-57 and  174(e) and 186 of the National Planning",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan (2021) and national guidance.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service. We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal.",
    "This is a reminder that Under the terms of the Planning Act 2008 (as amended) and Community Infrastructure Levy Regulations 2010 (as amended), should an application for appeal be allowed, the proposed development would be deemed as 'chargeable development' and therefore liable to pay the London Borough of Hillingdon Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and the Mayor of London's Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This would be calculated in accordance with the London Borough of Hillingdon CIL Charging Schedule 2014 and the Mayor of London's CIL Charging Schedule 2012.",
