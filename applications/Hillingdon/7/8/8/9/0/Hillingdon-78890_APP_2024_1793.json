    "The proposed rear dormer by reason of its bulk, scale, design and location would be insubordinate, visually incongruous and unsympathetic to the original architectural composition of the host dwelling and would result in the proposed development having a harmful impact to the original dwelling, and the character, appearance and visual amenities of the area. The proposed dormer would exceed two-thirds of the average width of the original roof, which conflicts with Policy DMHD 1. The proposal would therefore conflict with Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One Strategic Policies (2012) and Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020)."
