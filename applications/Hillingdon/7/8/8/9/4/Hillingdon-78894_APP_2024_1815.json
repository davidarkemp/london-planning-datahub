    "The proposed roof extensions, comprising hip to 'barn-gabled-end' features with rear dormer roof extensions, by reason of their cumulative impact and their size, scale, siting and design, would result in a visually obtrusive and incongruous form of development that would be detrimental to the character and original roof form of the host dwelling. The development would cause a harmful impact on the character and visual amenities of the street scene and context of the site and is therefore contrary to Policies DMHD 1 and DMHB 11 and of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management (2020) and Policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021).",

    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan - The Spatial Development Strategy for London consolidated with alterations since 2011 (2016) and national guidance."
