    "The proposed roof additions and alterations by reason of their siting, scale, bulk, height and design would be incongruous and disproportionate, resulting in poor design that would fail to respect the architectural integrity of the host dwelling. The proposal would therefore harm the visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area, all contrary to Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
