    "The proposed front porch extension due to its overall size, scale, design and positioning would result in incongruous appearance and overly dominant visual effect, which would harm the character and appearance of the original dwellinghouse and this part of the Harefield Village Conservation Area. The proposed development therefore would not preserve or enhance the character or appearance of the Conservation Area and would fail to comply with Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 4, DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), and Policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "The proposed replacement windows (including its dark grey finish) together with the use of a wood cladding finish to the first floor would cause visual harm to the architectural composition of the original building thereby, failing to make a positive contribution to local character or preserve the local distinctiveness which  adequately reflects the traditional characteristics of buildings in the wider Harefield Village Conservation Area.  As such, it fails  to comply with the policy objectives of Policy DMHB 11 and Policy DMHB 4 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), and Policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021."
