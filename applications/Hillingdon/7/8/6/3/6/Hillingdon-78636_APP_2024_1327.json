    "The proposed rear dormer roof extension and hip to gable roof extension, by reason of size, scale, siting and design, would result in over-dominant and disproportionate forms of development. The roof extensions would disrupt the visual relationship with adjoining sites and would therefore have a harmful impact on the character and appearance of the site and streetscape. As such, the development is contrary to policies DMHB11 and DMHD1 of the Hillington Local Plan : Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and Policy D4 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "The proposed ground floor side extension by reason of siting and design, would be unduly prominent and would disrupt the visual relationship between the pairs of semi-detached bungalows as it would fail to follow the pattern of development within the area resulting in a detrimental impact on the character and appearance of the residential area and street scene. As such, the proposal thereby fails to comply with Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One- Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), Policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (March 2021) and Chapter 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework (December 2023).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan - 2021 and National Planning Policy Framework 2023"
