    "The proposed development, by reason of its design, siting, size and site coverage as well as the attendant loss of trees, would form a cramped and contrived form of development, which would fail to harmonise with the existing pair of semi detached dwellings and be detrimental to the amenities of the site and surrounding area.  The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 11, DMH 6, DMHB 12 and DMHB 14 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), Policies D3, D4 and D6 of the London Plan (2021) and paragraph 130 of the NPPF (2021).",
    "Due to its substandard size, the external amenity space for the existing dwelling is considered to be of poor quality to the detriment of the living conditions and amenities of its future residents.  The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy DMHB 18 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies and Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "Due to its poor design and inadequate provision of internal floorspace, Bedroom 3 within the proposed dwelling would provide a cramped and substandard internal living environment for future residents of the property, to their detriment of their amenities. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy DMHB 16 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies and Policy D6(3) of the London Plan (2021).",
    "Due to its height, depth and position, the dwelling would cause a significant loss of outlook from the habitable rear windows of No.2 and No.4 Savoy Avenue and have an overbearing and overshadowing impact on their gardens, to the detriment of the amenities of current and future occupiers. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies and paragraph 130(f) of the NPPF (2021).",
    "The internal arrangement of the dwelling would fail to meet the requirements for a M4(2) accessible and adaptable dwelling as set out in Approved Document M to the Building Regulations (2015 edition). The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy D7 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan (2021).",
    "This is a reminder that Under the terms of the Planning Act 2008 (as amended) and Community Infrastructure Levy Regulations 2010 (as amended), should an application for appeal be allowed, the proposed development would be deemed as 'chargeable development' and therefore liable to pay the London Borough of Hillingdon Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and the Mayor of London's Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This would be calculated in accordance with the London Borough of Hillingdon CIL Charging Schedule 2014 and the Mayor of London's CIL Charging Schedule 2012.",
