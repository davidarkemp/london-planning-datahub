    "In the absence of accurate and consistent drawings of the original property and proposed single storey side and rear extensions, it is not possible to fully assess the planning merits of this proposal in terms of  its visual impact and its impact upon the amenities of the neighbouring properties. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021), Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012), and Policies DMHD1 and DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate that the proposed dropped kerb would not result in harm to highway safety for all users (pedestrian, cyclist and vehicle users), contrary to the Council's 'Domestic Vehicle Footway Crossover' Policy (2022), Policies DMT 1 and DMT2 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), and Policy T4 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "In order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably. In addition further guidance was offered to the applicant by the case officer during the processing of the application to identify the amendments to address those elements of the scheme considered unacceptable. However, the amendments required to make the application acceptable are substantial and would materially change the development proposal. They would require further consultation to be undertaken pri"
