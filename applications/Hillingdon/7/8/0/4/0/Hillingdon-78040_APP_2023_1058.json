    "The proposed two storey rear extensions, by virtue of their cumulative excessive scale and bulk and crown roofed design would represent  disproportionate additions that would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original dwellings, would be detrimental to the character, appearance of the terrace of houses of which it forms a part and to the visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area. The proposal would therefore be contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "The proposed two storey rear extensions, by reason of their cumulative size, design and proximity, would result in an overly dominant feature that overshadows the adjoining property at No.98 Manor Waye, and as such would result in a visually intrusive and an un-neighbourly form of development, resulting in a loss of light and material loss of residential amenity. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD1 of the  Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service. We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
