    "The development proposal by virtue of its scale, design, siting and illumination would be harmful to the visual amenity of the street scene and fail to preserve and enhance the appearance and character of the West Drayton Green Conservation Area, resulting in less than substantial harm. There are no public benefits to outweigh the harm identified. Therefore the development proposal would be contrary to Policies DMHB 4 and DMHB 13A of the Hillingdon Local plan - Part Two (2020) and Paragraph 215 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2024).",
    "The decision to REFUSE advertisement consent has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE advertisement consent has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan (2021) and national guidance."
