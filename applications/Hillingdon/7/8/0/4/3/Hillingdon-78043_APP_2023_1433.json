    "The proposed telecommunications street pole would, by virtue of its siting, size, scale, bulk and height, represent prominent and incongruous features in the street scene that would cause significant harm to the Conservation Area and have a detrimental impact on the visual amenities of the area, including as viewed from neighbouring residential properties along Mill Road and Mill Close. The proposed development would therefore be contrary to paragraphs 115, 130 c) and 195 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies D4, HC1 and SI6 of the London Plan (2021), Policies BE1 and HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012) and Policies DMHB 1, DMHB 2, DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHB 21 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The application fails to provide robust evidence to demonstrate that other more suitable and less harmful sites do not exist, and that they have actively explored the possibility of erecting the proposed telecommunications equipment on existing buildings, masts or other structures. The development would therefore be contrary to paragraphs 115 and 117 c) of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), and Policy DMHB 21 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The proposed mast is within 3 kilometres of an aerodrome and the applicant has failed to notify the Civil Aviation Authority and the aerodrome operator (Heathrow Airport), as required by condition A.3 (2) of Class A, Part 16, Schedule 2 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015.",
    "The proposed mast, by virtue of its close proximity to the shared side boundary with No.38 Mill Road, would have a visually overbearing impact and result in a loss of outlook to the occupants of neighbouring properties, particularly No.38. On account of this loss of residential amenity the proposal fails to comply with Policy DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020)."
