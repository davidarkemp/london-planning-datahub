    "The proposed works constitute development under Sec 55 of the Act and require an application for full planning permission. The proposed plans indicate amendments which would result in the installation of windows and removal of a chimney. The proposed works would introduce new development that was not included in the planning permission and conflict with Condition 5 of the original permission therefore does not constitute a non-material amendment under section 96A TCPA 1990. The potential impacts therefore need to be considered against development plan policies."
