    "The proposed replacement of thirteen timber-framed windows and two timber-framed doors with uPVC windows and doors, by reason of their materials, detailing, and fenestration, would harm the character and appearance of the host dwelling and The Greenway Conservation Area and would not respect or enhance the architectural features that contribute towards the local character. Accordingly, the proposal would be contrary to Policy 16 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023), Policies HC1, D3, and D6 of The London Plan (2021), Policies BE1 and HE1 of Hillingdon Council's Local Plan Part 1 Strategic Policies (2012), and Policies DMHB 1, DMHB 4, DMHB 11, DMHB 12, and DMHD 1 of the London Borough of Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 Development Management Policies (2020)."
