    "Cumulatively, the proposed development, by reason of its excessive bulk, scale, massing and design would be unduly prominent, visually incongruous and unsympathetic to the original architectural composition of the host dwelling, resulting in the proposed development having a harmful impact to original dwelling, and the character, appearance and visual amenities of the area.  The proposal would therefore conflict with Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan (November 2012), Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan - Part Two (2020) and Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021) and Chapter 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023)."
