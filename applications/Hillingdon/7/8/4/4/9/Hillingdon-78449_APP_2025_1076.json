    "The proposed extensions and external staircase and privacy screens, in terms of their scale, bulk and siting individually and in combination, would represent incongruous and unsightly additions to the host building, failing to relate to its character and appearance or that of the wider area and Conservation Area. The development would result in less than substantial harm and would fail to either preserve or enhance the Conservation Area which is a designated heritage asset. The development would therefore fail to comply with Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One (2012), DMHB 1, DMHB 4, DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two (2020), Policies D1, D3 and D6 of the London Plan (2021) and as well as Section 16 of the NPPF (2024).",
    "The proposal, on account of the addition of a large expanse of rooflights upon the side extension and a platform landing at the top of the new staircase, would result in a significant increase in perceived overlooking and loss of privacy to the occupiers at no. 61 Pipp",
    "ions Close especially and also to the neighbours to the south and east, to the detriment of the amenities of occupiers and contrary to Policy DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two (2020)."
