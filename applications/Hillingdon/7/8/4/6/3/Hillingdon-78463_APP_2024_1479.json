    "The proposed development, by reason of design, scale and overall massing, would harm the character and appearance of the application property and would break the symmetry and architectural composition of the semi-detached formation. The proposed extension would also fail to constitute a subservient addition to the semi-detached building, by reason of excessive height and massing along the side roof slope. As such, the development would not conserve or enhance the character and appearance of the property and streetscape and would therefore be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2021), Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management (2020), Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021) and Chapter 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service."
