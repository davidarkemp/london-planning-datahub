    "The proposed development, by virtue of its bulk, size, scale and overall massing, would result in alterations to the dwelling that would be  detrimental to the architectural composition of the original property, adjoining pair and character and appearance of the street scene. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2021), Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management (2020), Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021) and Chapter 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023).",
    "The proposed rear extension, by reason of excessive depth and height, would result in an unacceptable loss of daylight and sunlight to the neighbouring occupiers at attached dwelling Number 22 Coniston Gardens. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service."
