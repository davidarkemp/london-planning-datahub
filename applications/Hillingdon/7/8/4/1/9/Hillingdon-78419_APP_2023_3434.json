    "The proposed development, by virtue of its siting, bulk and level of projection out above the ground floor windows serving the neighbouring apartment, would be detrimental to the amenities of the occupiers at no.2 Island Apartments, giving rise to a harmful loss of outlook, loss of light, overbearing nature and sense of enclosure to the ground floor apartment and the associated patio area, as well as reducing the quality of communal amenity space in the rear garden. Therefore, the proposal would be contrary to Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 18 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and the NPPF (2023).",
    "In the absence of a supporting information to satisfy the concerns raised by the Environment Agency, the application has failed to address the issues relating to flood risk and the proposal is therefore contrary to Policy EM6 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policy DMEI 9 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies, Policy SI 12 - Flood Risk Management (f) of The London Plan 2021, paragraphs 005 and 020 to 021 of the Flood Risk and Coastal Change of the PPG, the National Planning Practice Framework (NPPF)."
