    "The location and amount of development proposed would result in a harmful loss of garden land and the development would also fail to harmonise with the prevailing development pattern of the street scene thereby harming the character and appearance of the area. The principle of intensifying the residential use involving the loss of existing private garden areas is considered to be unacceptable in principle. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012), Policies DMH 6, DMHB 11, DMHB 14 and DMHB 17 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policies D3 and D6 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2023)."
