  "decision_conditions": [
    "By virtue of its uncharacteristic design, excessive scale, extensive site coverage, and backland location, the proposal represents an over development of the site, which would also cause significant harm to the character and appearance of the area and streetscene, contrary to paragraph 135 of the NPPF (2023), Policies GC2, D2 and D3 of the London Plan 2021, Policy B1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan (Part 1) 2012 and Policies DMH 6, DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan (Part 2) 2020.",
    "Due to its excessive height and depth, Building 3 would lead to a loss of outlook and light to the first floor habitable room windows of 12 Delamere Road, subsequently harming the amenities of the properties occupiers contrary to Policy D3 of the London Plan, Policy DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan 2020 and paragraph 135 of the NPPF (2023).",
    "The proposal does not make provision for separate pedestrian access from and to Delamere Road, leading to unacceptable conflict between those entering and existing the site via car and foot. The development would therefore reduce pedestrian and vehicle user safety, whilst also creating an impediment to traffic flows on Delamere Road, contrary to Section 9 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2023, Policy T4 of the London Plan 2021, Policies DMT 1 and DMT 2 of the Hillingdon Local Plan 2020.",
    "The proposal does not make provision for adequate pedestrian visibility splays at the entrance on Delamere Road, thereby posing a high likelihood of conflict between pedestrians crossing the entrance and vehicles leaving or entering the entrance. The development would therefore reduce pedestrian and vehicle user safety, whilst also creating an impediment to traffic flows on Delamere Road, contrary to Section 9 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2023, Policy T4 of the London Plan 2021, Policies DMT 1 and DMT 2 of the Hillingdon Local Plan 2020, and the Hillingdon Domestic Vehicle Footway Crossover Policy.",
    "The proposed development involves extensive site clearance works which would lead to a significant loss of riparian semi-natural habitat within the riparian zone of the Yeading Brook. Furthermore the proposal makes inadequate provision for an effective ecological buffer along the boundary with Yeading Brook.  Due to its close proximity to the Yeading Brook, the development is likely to lead to the deterioration of the bank, as well as the remaining trees and greenery lining the bank (referenced as G3 on the submitted tree survey). The development is therefore considered to cause signficant harm to the ecological value of the site and Yeading Brook contrary to Section 15 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2023, Policy G6 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies DMEI 5, DMEI 7 and DMEI 8 of the Hillingdon Local Plan 2020.",
    "In the absence of an arboricultural impact assessment, it is not possible to conclude that the proposal would not result in adverse harm to existing trees on or adjacent to the site (referenced as G3 on the submitted tree survey) , thereby resulting in a net deterioration in the landscape character of the site, contrary to Section 15 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021, Policy G7 of the London Plan 2021, Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan (Part 1) 2012 and Policy DMHB 14 of the Hillingdon Local Plan (Part 2) 2020.",
    "Buildings 1, 2 and 3 fail to meet the requirements for a M4(2) accessible and adaptable dwellings as set out in Approved Document M to the Building Regulations (2015 edition). The proposal would therefore fail to provide adequate levels of living accommodation for those with accessible needs, contrary to Policy D7 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan (2021) and NPPF (2023).",
    "This is a reminder that Under the terms of the Planning Act 2008 (as amended) and Community Infrastructure Levy Regulations 2010 (as amended), should an application for appeal be allowed, the proposed development would be deemed as 'chargeable development' and therefore liable to pay the London Borough of Hillingdon Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and the Mayor of London's Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This would be calculated in accordance with the London Borough of Hillingdon CIL Charging Schedule 2014 and the Mayor of London's CIL Charging Schedule 2012.",
