    "The proposed front porch with canopy and two columns, by virtue of its size, scale, bulk, height and design fails to appear subordinate to the existing dwelling and would be detrimental to the character and appearance of the original dwelling and the visual amenity of the street scene and Area of Special Local Character. The proposal would therefore not be in accordance with the Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One Strategic (2012) and Policies DMHB 5, DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and Policy DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
