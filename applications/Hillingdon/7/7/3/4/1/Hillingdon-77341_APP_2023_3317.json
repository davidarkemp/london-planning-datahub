    "The proposed development, by virtue of its poor outlook, poor levels of natural light, ceiling height and inadequate external amenity space provision would result in a substandard form of residential accommodation to the detriment of the amenity of future occupants. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policies DMHB 16 and DMHB 18 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2- Development Management Policies (2020), Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021) and Chapter 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023).",
    "The proposed development has failed to provide adequate provision for 1.5 cycle stores. Due to the constrained nature of the access to the site, and the location of the cycle store. the proposal would fail to deliver safe, secure and accessible cycle stores. The proposal would therefore conflict with Policies DMHB 11 and DMT 5 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2- Development Management Policies (2020), Policy T5 of the London Plan (2021) and Chapter 9 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "a) We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
