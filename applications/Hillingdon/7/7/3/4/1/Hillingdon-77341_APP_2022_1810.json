    "The proposed development, by reason of the excessive size, scale and bulk of the side and rear dormers, coupled with their prominent siting and design would result in an incongruous and visually obtrusive form of development which would fail to respect the architectural composition of the original primary shopping parade, would be detrimental to the character, appearance and symmetry of the terrace properties of which it forms a part and to the visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012),  Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policies D1, D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The proposed development, by reason of design and proximity to an existing commercial flue, would result in a development of poor quality living accommodation which would subject the current and future residents of the dwelling to poor air quality and odour to the determent of their health and quality of living conditions. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies BE1 and EM8 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012),  Policies DMHB 11 and DMEI 14 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policies D3, GG3 and SI 1 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The proposed dormers, by reason of its overall size, height, bulk, design and proximity to the neighbours, in combination with the site context, would be detrimental to the residential amenities of the adjoining occupier at No.56A Victoria Roade by reason of loss of outlook, overlooking, overdominance and overbearing effect. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policies DMHB11 and DMHD1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan - Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan - The Spatial Development Strategy for London consolidated with alterations since 2011 (2016) and national guidance."
