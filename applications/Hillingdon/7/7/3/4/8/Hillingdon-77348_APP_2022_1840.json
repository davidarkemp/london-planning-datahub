    "The proposed single storey rear extension and raised full-width steps, by reason of its siting, width, depth, scale and proximity would be detrimental to the amenities of the adjacent occupiers of nos. 49 and 53 Royal Lane, in terms of overdominance, overshadowing, visual intrusion, overbearing impact, loss of daylight/sunlight, loss of outlook, overlooking and loss of privacy. Therefore, the proposal would be contrary to Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2021) Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020."
