    "The proposed development represents inappropriate development within the Green Belt. No very special circumstances have been demonstrated to outweigh the developments substantial harm to the Green Belt and other harm identified. The development is therefore harmful to the Green Belt and contrary to the aims of Policy EM2 of the Local Plan Part 1 (2012), Policy DMEI 14 of The Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy G2 of the London Plan (2021) and paragraph 154 of the NPPF (2023).",
    "In the absence of sufficient ecology information, it has not been demonstrated that the proposal would not have an adverse impact upon protected species, natural environment and nature conservation.  As such, the proposal is contrary to Policy EM7 of the Hillingdon Local Plan (Part 1) 2012, Policies DMEI 7 and DMHB 14 of the Hillingdon Local Plan (Part Two) 2020, Policy G6 of the London Plan 2021 and Schedule 7A of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 and the Environment Act 2021",
    "The application has failed to justify the need for the layout of development which will result in the removal of valuable trees (trees G1, T3, T4 and T5) and is likely to result in harm to further trees, including but not limited to trees T7 and T8 which are category C and B value trees. The application fails to demonstrate that these trees would be protected and retained in the long term. Accordingly, the development could result in adverse and irreversible impacts to landscaping, trees, biodiversity or other natural features of merit, detrimental to the visual amenities of the area and, contrary to paragraph 136 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023), Policy G7 of the London Plan (2021), and Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHB 14 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 (2020).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan (2021) and national guidance."
