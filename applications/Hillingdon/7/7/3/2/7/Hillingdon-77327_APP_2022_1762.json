    "The proposed annexe, by reason of its provision of facilities required for day-to-day private domestic existence and the availability of independent access to it, would result in the creation of a self-contained residential unit where such a dwelling would be unacceptable, due to the requirements of internal and external amenity spaces for future occupiers, and its detrimental impact on the character and appearance of the area and on the living conditions of neighbouring occupiers. The proposal would therefore conflict with Policies DMH 6, DMHB 11, DMHB 12, DMHB 16, DMHB 18 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policies  D3, D4, D6 and D8 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The proposed self-contained residential unit would have no private amenity space provision, would have a substandard internal floor area and would have compromised privacy to habitable rooms and garden space of both the proposed annexe and the existing dwelling. It would therefore give rise to a substandard form of living accommodation to the detriment of the amenities of future occupiers and would adversely affect the living conditions of occupiers of the existing dwelling. The proposal, therefore, conflicts, with Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 16 and DMHB 18 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The proposed single storey rear extension due to its scale, depth and proximity to the shared boundary would result in loss of light to and loss of outlook from habitable rooms and the garden of No. 63 East Road, to the detriment of the residential amenity of these neighbouring occupiers. The proposal is thus contrary to policy DMHB11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan - Part Two (2020) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan (2021) and national guidance.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
