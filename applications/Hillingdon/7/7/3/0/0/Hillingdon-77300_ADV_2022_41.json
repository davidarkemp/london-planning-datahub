    "The large scale of the advertisements, in combination with the substantially-sized LCD screen and its prominent proposed location and luminance, would result in an obtrusive and incongruous addition which would clutter the public realm and undermine this public realm as a community focus point of this town centre, detrimental to the character and appearance of the street scene and general locality. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), and DMHB 11, 12, 13A and 21 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and policies D3 and D8 of The London Plan (2021); and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The scale, siting and illumination of the advertisements would unduly distract motorists, pedestrians and cyclists from proper observation of the highway and obstruct the free-flow of pedestrian movement, adversely affecting public safety. The proposal therefore is contrary to policies DMHB 13A and DMT2 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), London Plan policy T4 and the National Planning Policy Framework."
