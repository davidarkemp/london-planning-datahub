    "The large scale of the communication hub, in combination with the substantially-sized LCD screen, by reason of its prominent proposed location, design, luminance and siting, would cumulatively result in an obtrusive and incongruous addition which would clutter the public realm, detrimental to the character and appearance of the street scene and general locality. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), and DMHB 11, 12, 13A and 21 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and policies D3 and D8 of The London Plan (2021); and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The large scale of the communication hub, in combination with the substantially-sized LCD screen, by reason of its prominent proposed location, design, luminance and siting, would significantly obstruct visibility of highway users (pedestrians, drivers and cyclists). This restricted visibility in close proximity to moving traffic (cyclists and vehicles) present significant risks to the safety of users of both the pavement and the carriageway. The proposal therefore is contrary to policies DMHB 13A and DMT2 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), London Plan policy T4 and the National Planning Policy Framework."
