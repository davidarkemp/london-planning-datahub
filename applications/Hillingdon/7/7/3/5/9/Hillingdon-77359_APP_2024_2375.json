    "Due to its design, siting, height and bulk the proposed development would result in an cramped and uncharacteristic form of development which would fail to harmonise with the street scene, urban grain and character of the surrounding area. The proposal is therefore considered to be detrimental to the visual amenity and character of the surrounding area, contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies, Policies DMH 6, DMHB 5, DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policies D1, D3 and D6 of the London Plan (2021), as well as paragraphs 72, 128 and 135 of the NPPF (2023).",
    "Due to its design and internal arrangement, the proposed dwelling would fail to meet the requirements for a M4(2) accessible and adaptable dwelling as set out in Approved Document M to the Building Regulations (2015 edition). The proposed dwelling would therefore fail to comply with Policy D7 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate that adequate parking would be provided for the existing dwelling. The lack of parking provision would result in parking being displaced on street. The applicant has failed to provide information to demonstrate that the local highway network has sufficient capacity to withstand the displaced parking on street, which in turn reduces highway and pedestrian safety, whilst also prejudicing the free flow of traffic on the local highways network. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy DMT 2 and DMT 6 of the Local Plan and Policy T4 and T6 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "The proposed development would result in an unacceptable level of overlooking of the garden to serve future occupants of the dwelling, leading to a significant lack of privacy for future occupants. Furthermore, the development would introduce a poor level of outlook, daylight and sunlight to serve the ground floor habitable room area,  resulting in an oppressive and overbearing sense of enclosure. It is therefore considered that users of the new dwelling would have a poor standard of internal and external amenity space to the detriment of their amenities. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policy DMHB 18 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and paragraph 135 (f) of the NPPF (2023).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan (2021) and NPPF (2023).",
    "This is a reminder that Under the terms of the Planning Act 2008 (as amended) and Community Infrastructure Levy Regulations 2010 (as amended), should an application for appeal be allowed, the proposed development would be deemed as 'chargeable development' and therefore liable to pay the London Borough of Hillingdon Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and the Mayor of London's Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This would be calculated in accordance with the London Borough of Hillingdon CIL Charging Schedule 2014 and the Mayor of London's CIL Charging Schedule 2012.",
