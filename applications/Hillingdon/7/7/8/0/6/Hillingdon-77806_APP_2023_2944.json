    "Due to its adverse impact on important trees, poor design, cramped layout, alongside excessive height and bulk in a backland location, the new residential building would cause harm to the Old Northwood Area of Special Local Character and the general character and appearance of the area. The proposal is considered to be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies, Policies DMH 6, DMHB 1, DMHB 5, DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHB 14 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policies D1, D3 and D6 of the London Plan (2021), as well as paragraph 135 of the NPPF (2023).",
    "The converted mews building would have a ground floor living room window which provides, direct and unimpeded views into the rear elevation windows and garden of 24 Hallowell Road at a distance of approximately 8m.  The proposed development would therefore cause a significant loss of privacy to the occupiers of the mentioned property to the detriment of their amenities and living conditions. The proposal is therefore considered to be contrary to Policies DMH 6 and DMHB 11, of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021), and paragraph 135 (f) of the NPPF (2023).",
    "The proposed development, on account of the inter-visibility between the first floor habitable room windows serving the mews building and Flats 2 and 4, would result in poor levels of privacy to the occupiers of all three dwellings. Furthermore residents of the converted mews building would have to walk directly past the sole bedroom window of Flat 2 to access their bike and waste storage facilities. The arrangement would lead to a significant loss of privacy for occupiers of the Flat. Additionally, new residents of the converted Mews Building would be provided with poor levels of outlook,  as all of their primary habitable room windows would face the new block of flats at short distance. The proposed development is therefore considered to be of detriment to the amenities of occupiers of the Mews Building, as well as Flats 2 and 4, contrary to Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021) and paragraph 135 (f) of the NPPF (2023).",
    "All of the proposed flats would fail to provide future residents with 2.5m floor to ceiling heights for a minimum of 75% of the internal floor area of each of the flats. Residents of the flats would therefore be subjected to poor and inadequate internal living accommodation to the detriment of their amenities. As such, the development fails to comply with Policy D6 (8) of London Plan (2021).",
    "In the absence of an infrastructure assessment, the applicant has failed to demonstrate that the development would not result in detrimental harm to national infrastructure owned by Network Rail. The development is therefore contrary to Policies DMT 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and Policies D2 and T1 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "The proposed development fails to provide adequate external amenity space for the future residents of the converted mews building, as well as flats 2, 3, 4 and 5. Residents of the flats and converted mews building would therefore be subjected to poor and inadequate external living accommodation to the detriment of their amenities. As such, the development fails to comply with Policy DMHB 18 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate that there is no realistic prospect of the land and commercial uses which exist on the site being reused for employment purposes. Nor has it been robustly demonstrated that the site is unsuitable for employment reuse or development because of its size, shape, location, or unsuitability of access. The proposed development fails to comply with Policy DME 2 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and Policy E2 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan (2021) and NPPF (2023).",
    "This is a reminder that Under the terms of the Planning Act 2008 (as amended) and Community Infrastructure Levy Regulations 2010 (as amended), should an application for appeal be allowed, the proposed development would be deemed as 'chargeable development' and therefore liable to pay the London Borough of Hillingdon Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and the Mayor of London's Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This would be calculated in accordance with the London Borough of Hillingdon CIL Charging Schedule 2014 and the Mayor of London's CIL Charging Schedule 2012.",
