According to the report the Beech is structurally sound with some deadwood and epicormic growth, the removal of deadwood is exempt from the application process. According to the report the Apples require work due to having lacked maintenance in the past. The trees are set away from the properties and are seen to have appropriately sized canopies for the space. Crown reductions by as much as 20% is excessive, will lead to multiple wounds within their canopies and likely to lead to dysfunction.",
