    "In the absence of supporting information to demonstrate a need for the C2 use, the proposal would result in the loss of residential accommodation which would conflict with the requirements of Policies H8 and H12 of the London Plan (2021) and Policy DMH1 and DMH8 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020) which aims to meet the Council's projected Housing Needs through safeguarding the use of existing Class C3 accommodation.",
    "The proposed development, given the number of potential occupants across 9 no. separate bedrooms, staff and visitors, would give rise to unacceptable noise and general disturbance to neighbouring residents as a result of a marked increase in comings and goings, use of the rear garden and the lack of information relating to sound insulation or appropriate details relating to the management or operation of the care home use. The proposal would therefore be contrary to the requirements of Policy H12 of the London Plan (2021) and Policy DMHB11 and DMH8 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020)  which aims to meet the Council's projected Housing Needs.",
    "The proposed development has failed to demonstrate that it would provide an adequate level of outlook for the future occupiers of bedroom 8  due to its reliance solely on rooflights, which are set at high level. The proposal would therefore give rise to a substandard form of living accommodation to the detriment of the amenities of future occupiers contrary to Policy DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies and Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
