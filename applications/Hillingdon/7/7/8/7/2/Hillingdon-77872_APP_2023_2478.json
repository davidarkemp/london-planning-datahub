    "In the absence of sufficient justification, the proposal involves the loss of employment floorspace within an allocated location, thereby reducing available flexible, accessible and attractive employment floorspace in the borough, contrary to Section 6 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021, Policies E3, E4 and E6 of the London Plan 2021, Policies E1 and E6 of the Hillingdon Local Plan (Part 1) 2012 and Policy DME 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan (Part 2) 2020.",
    "The removal of the original workshop doors and their replacement with a pedestrian door and insertion of a new window diminishes the architectural integrity and character of the existing building and the area, contrary to Section 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021, Policies D2 and D3 of the London Plan 2021, Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan (Part 1) 2012 and Policies DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan (Part 2) 2020.",
    "Due to the cumulative impacts of the lack of storage capacity, lack of any outdoor amenity space and the location of the bedroom and study windows alongside the carpark (and subsequent poor outlook and air quality afforded to these habitable spaces), the proposal exhibits a substandard level of amenity, detrimental to the living standards of future occupants. This is contrary to Sections 12 and 15 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021, Policies D3 and D6 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies DMHB 16, DMHB 18 and DMEI 14 of the Hillingdon Local Plan (Part 2) 2020.",
    "The proposal fails to provide adequate car and cycle parking for the proposed residential unit, resulting in increased pressure on existing car parking availability and poor sustainability credentials in an area with limited access to public transport, facilities and services, contrary to Section 9 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021, Policies T4, T5 and T6.1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies DMT 1, DMT 2, DMT 5 and DMT 6 of the Hillingdon Local Plan (Part 2) 2020.",
    "In the absence of sufficient detail, the proposal has no refuse storage for the existing occupants of the residential unit and the future occupants of the proposed dwelling, resulting in a lack of proper waste management and likely clutter in the public domain, contrary to Section 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021, Policy D6 of the London Plan 2021, Policies BE1 and EM11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan (Part 1) 2012 and Policy DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan (Part 2) 2020.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service. We have also allowed for revisions to the scheme and assessed these revisions. However we have been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
