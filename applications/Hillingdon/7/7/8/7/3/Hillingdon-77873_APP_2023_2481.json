    "The location of the bedroom window alongside the carpark would result in poor outlook and air quality afforded to the habitable and together with the lack of storage capacity, lack of any outdoor amenity space, the proposal would exhibit a substandard level of amenity, detrimental to the living standards of future occupants. This is contrary to Sections 12 and 15 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2023, Policies D3 and D6 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies DMHB 16, DMHB 18 and DMEI 14 of the Hillingdon Local Plan (Part 2) 2021.",
    "The proposal fails to provide would fail to deliver safe, secure and accessible cycle stores. The proposal would therefore conflict with Policies DMHB 11 and DMT 5 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2- Development Management Policies (2020), Policy T5 of the London Plan (2021) and Chapter 9 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023).",
    "In the absence of sufficient detail, the proposal has no refuse storage for the existing occupants of the residential unit and the future occupants of the proposed dwelling, resulting in a lack of proper waste management and likely clutter in the public domain, contrary to Section 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2023, Policy D6 of the London Plan 2021, Policies BE1 and EM11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan (Part 1) 2012 and Policies DMHB 11 and DMH 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan (Part 2) 2020.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service. We have also allowed for revisions to the scheme and assessed these revisions. However we have been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
