    "The proposed extensions would, by virtue of their failure to maintain an adequate amount of private usable external amenity space for the occupiers of the existing property, result in over-development of the site and a poor standard of accommodation, detrimental to the residential amenity of current and future occupiers. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies DMHB11 and DMHD1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
