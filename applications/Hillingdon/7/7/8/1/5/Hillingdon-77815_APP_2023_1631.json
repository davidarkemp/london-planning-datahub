    "The proposed rear extension, by reason of its design, scale, depth, bulk and massing, would appear as a disproportionate and incongruous addition to the host dwelling that would be detrimental to its character and appearance. For the same reasons the extension would form a oversized and uncharacteristic addition to to the area, as extensions are generally smaller in depth and size. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021) and paragraph 130 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021),"
