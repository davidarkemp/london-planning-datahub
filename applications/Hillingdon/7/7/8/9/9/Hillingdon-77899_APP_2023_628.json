    "The proposed Velux cabrio balcony system windows on the rear elevation by reason of their ability to protrude significantly beyond the rear roof slope, height, siting and design would appear as an overly dominant addition to the roof slope of the building, and would be detrimental to the architectural composition of the existing building. They would fails to either preserve or enhance the character and appearance of the Ruislip Village Conservation Area, resulting in less than significant harm that is not outweighed by any identifiable public benefits. The proposal would therefore be contrary Policies BE1 and HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012), Policies DMHB 1, DMHB 4, and DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two- Development Management Policies (2020), Policies HC1 and D3 of the London Plan (2021), Chapters 12 and 16 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021) and Section 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 19",
