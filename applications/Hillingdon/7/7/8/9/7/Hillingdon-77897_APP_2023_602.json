    "By virtue of its box form design, orientation, appearance and disruption to the pattern and rhythm of the linear parade of shops posed by the proposed workshop building and the removal of traditional characteristics to the shopfront of 38 Green Lane, the development would fail to preserve or enhance the character and appearance of the Northwood Town Centre, Green Lane Conservation Area. It would result in less than substantial and unacceptable harm to the setting and character of the Northwood Town Centre, Green Lane Conservation Area, as well as the visual amenity of the street scene. When weighing the public benefits, these would not outweigh the identified harm. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies HE1 and BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One Strategic Policies (2012), Policies DMHB 1, DMHB 4, and DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020), Policies D3 and HC1 of the London Plan (2021), and Chapters 12 and 16 of the National",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service. We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal.",
