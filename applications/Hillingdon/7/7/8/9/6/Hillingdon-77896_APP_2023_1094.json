    "The conversion of the existing three-bedroom dwelling into 2 x one-bedroom flats would result in the loss of a 4 bedroom residential unit that is suitable and appropriately sized for a family without its replacement with accommodation of suitable standard. The proposal would therefore unacceptably undermine the supply of family housing within the Borough, contrary to Policies DMH 1, DMH 2 and DMH 4 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and Policy H10 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "The proposed 1 bedroom, 2 person flat, set over 2 floors would fail to provide its future residents with 58sqm of internal living accommodation. It is therefore considered that the proposed development would provide its future occupants with a cramped, unsatisfactory and poor standard of internal living accommodation to the detriment of their amenities. The proposal would fail to accord with  Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021),  DMHB 16 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020) and paragraph 130 (f) of the NPPF (2021).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan (2021) and national guidance.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "a) We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal.",
    "This is a reminder that Under the terms of the Planning Act 2008 (as amended) and Community Infrastructure Levy Regulations 2010 (as amended), should an application for appeal be allowed, the proposed development would be deemed as 'chargeable development' and therefore liable to pay the London Borough of Hillingdon Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and the Mayor of London's Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This would be calculated in accordance with the London Borough of Hillingdon CIL Charging Schedule 2014 and the Mayor of London's CIL Charging Schedule 2012.",
    "For more information on CIL matters please visit the planning portal page at: www.planningportal.gov.uk/planning/applications/howtoapply/whattosubmit/cil"
