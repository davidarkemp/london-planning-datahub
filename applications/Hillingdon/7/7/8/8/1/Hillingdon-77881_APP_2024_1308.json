The development is therefore harmful to the Green Belt, contrary to Section 13 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023), Policy G2 of the London Plan (2021), Policy EM2 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012) and Policy DMEI 4 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",

The development is therefore harmful to the character and appearance of the area, contrary to Sections 12 and 13 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023), Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021), Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One- Strategic Policies (2012) and Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 2 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020).",

We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service. We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal.",
