    "The proposal represents inappropriate development in the Green Belt by definition, it poses unacceptable harm to the openness of the Green Belt, does not include any very special circumstances to outweigh the harm and is unacceptable in principle, contrary to Section 13 the National Planning Policy Framework 2021, Policy G2 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies EM2 and DMEI 4 of the Hillingdon Local Plan (Part 2) 2020.",
    "In the absence of a preliminary ecology assessment, it has not been demonstrated that the required works to the existing dwellings would not have an adverse impact upon protected species and nature conservation or that there would be protection and enhancement of biodiversity, contrary to Section 15 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021, Policy G6 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies BE1, DMHB 14 and DMEI 7 of the Hillingdon Local Plan (Part 2) 2020.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service. We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
