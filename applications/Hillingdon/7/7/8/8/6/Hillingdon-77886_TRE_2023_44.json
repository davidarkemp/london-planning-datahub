    "The Willow is situated in a prominent location at the end of the Close and is the largest tree in this area. It has a very high amenity value and significantly contributes to the arboricultural character of the local area.",
    "An inspection was completed to assess the suitability of the application, the Willow was found to be budding well and no major deadwood was found within the canopy. There are a number of wildlife holes within some of the branches however no evidence as to the level of decay/ hollowing has been provided, the previous pollard work has reduced the weight on these limbs and the main trunk appeared stable. As a result felling appears premature, willows take well to pollarding and the applicant my wish to think about reapplying to pollard at a lower height.",
    "Having regard to the reasons given for the proposed work, the work is unjustified and will have a detrimental impact on the visual amenity and arboreal character of the area.",
    "The removal of deadwood, dangerous / hanging branches and ivy:  This does not require the formal consent of the Council."
