    "Given the nature of the proposed development it is possible that a crane may be required during its construction.  Heathrow Aerodrome would, therefore, draw the applicant's attention to the requirement within the British Standard Code of Practice for the safe use of Cranes, for crane operators to consult the aerodrome before erecting a crane in close proximity to an aerodrome.
