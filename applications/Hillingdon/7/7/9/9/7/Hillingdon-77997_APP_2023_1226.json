    "The proposed development does not constitute permitted development by virtue of the provisions of Article 3, Schedule 2, Part 1, Class A of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015, as the proposed development would unduly detract from the residential amenity of the adjoining occupiers by reason of its depth and scale having an overbearing impact. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020) and Prior Approval is refused."
