    "Prior to the commencement of the proposed development, a site survey shall be conducted to identify levels of any contamination that may be present. Details of the survey and an appropriate risk assessment shall be submitted to and approved by the LPA. Any required remedial works shall include an assessment of the extent of contamination and provide, in detail, the measures to be taken to suitably address all unacceptable concentrations of identified contaminants at the site and thereby avoid risk to the occupiers and all other identified receptors when the site is developed. All works which form part of the remediation scheme shall be completed before any part of the development is occupied (unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority). The condition will not be discharged until verification of the remedial works has been submitted to and agreed in writing by the LPA. and if required a remediation scheme shall be implemented.",
