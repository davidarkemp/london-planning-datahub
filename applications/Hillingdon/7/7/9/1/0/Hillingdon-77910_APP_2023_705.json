    "The single storey rear extension would appear overdominant on the boundary with 28 Burbridge Gardens, resulting in a sense of enclosure and loss of light, harming the amenities of the occupier, contrary to Policies DMHD1 and DMHB11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two (2020).",
    "In the absence of a Flood Risk Assessment, the application fails to demonstrate that the scheme would be resilient to flooding, contrary to Policy DMEI of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two (2020).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.  We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
