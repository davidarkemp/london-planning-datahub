    "The proposed development represents inappropriate development within the Green Belt, is harmful by definition to its open character and appearance and there are no very special circumstances provided or which are evident which either singularly or cumulatively justify the development which would overcome the presumption against inappropriate development in the Green Belt. The development is therefore harmful to the Green Belt, contrary to Section 13 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2023, Policy EM2 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policy DMEI 4 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",

The development is therefore contrary to  the National Planning Policy Framework 2023, Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One- Strategic Policies (2012) and Policies DMHB 11 and DMHB 12  of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service. We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
