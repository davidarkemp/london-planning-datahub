    "The proposed development does not constitute permitted development by virtue of the provisions of Article 3, Schedule 2, Part 1, Class A of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015, as the proposed development would cause significant harm to the residential amenities of the adjoining occupiers by reason of visual intrusion, overshadowing, light loss, and loss of outlook. The proposal is contrary to Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020) and Prior Approval is refused."
