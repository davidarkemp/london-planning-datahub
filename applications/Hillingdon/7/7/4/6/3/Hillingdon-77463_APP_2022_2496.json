    "Due to the excessive width and siting of the dropped kerb, the proposal would harm the character and appearance of the Area of Special Local Character (ASLC). The proposal is therefore considered to be harmful to the visual amenities of the streetscene, surrounding area and ASLC to the detriment of their character and appearance. As such the proposal is contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 5, DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "Due to the excessive width of the proposed dropped kerb there would be a reduction in pedestrian refugee spaces. Therefore, the proposed development is therefore unacceptable in terms of highway and pedestrian safety and is considered to be contrary to Policies DMT 1 and 2 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "The site lies within a Critical Drainage Area (CDA) as identifies in the Surface Water Management Plan (SWMP) for Hillingdon. A CDA is the catchment area from which surface water drains and contributes to drainage problem . In the event of future applications, if the plans are approved all development in this area must contribute to managing the risk of flooding from surface water by reducing surface water runoff from the site. Therefore the applicant should minimise the water from your site entering the sewers. Water run off from any hard paving associated with the development should be directed to a soakaway, or tank or made permeable. This includes any work to front gardens not part of the planning application, which must be permeable or be collected and directed to a permeable area, otherwise it would need an additional permission."
