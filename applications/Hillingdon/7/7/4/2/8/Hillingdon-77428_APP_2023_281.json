    "A 6.6sqm bedroom would be provided for one of the residents of the proposed facility. Due to its inadequate size the room would provide its future resident with a cramped, undersized and unsatisfactory living environment to the detriment of their amenities. The proposed development is therefore considered to be contrary to Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021) and paragraph 130 (f) of the NPPF (2021).",
    "The proposed development, on account of existing and approved facilities in the vicinity and the lack of an identified need in the Borough,  would lead to an oversupply of assisted living accommodation in the area to the detriment of the area's character and resulting in the loss of existing C4 accommodation that contributes to housing supply. The proposed development is therefore considered to be contrary to Policies DMH 1 and DMH 8 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 (2020) and Policy H12 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan - The Spatial Development Strategy for London consolidated with alterations since 2011 (2016) and national guidance."
