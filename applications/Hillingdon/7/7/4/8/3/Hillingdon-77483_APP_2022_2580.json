    "The proposed rear extensions, by reason of their siting, height, width, depth, bulk and massing including the proximity to the rear boundary, would result in a cramped and squeezed addition that would be visually intrusive, disproportionate, incongruous, dominant and overbearing, failing to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original dwelling, visual amenities of the streetscene and character and appearance of the area. Therefore, the proposal would be contrary to Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021), Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012), Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The proposed rear extensions, by virtue of their close siting, combined height, width, depth, bulk and massing would give rise to unacceptable loss of privacy, outlook, overbearing impact, visual intrusion, sense of enclosure and some loss of daylight/sunlight to the occupiers of no.1 Third Avenue. Therefore, the proposal would be contrary to Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The proposed extensions, in particular the part single; part two-story rear element, by reason of its close siting to the common boundary fence would create a poor living environment for existing occupiers with regards to loss of outlook and natural daylight/sunlight. Therefore, the proposal would be contrary to Policies D5 and D7 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2021). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020."
