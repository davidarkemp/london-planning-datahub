    "The proposed front dormer, by reason of its size, scale, width, height and design and positioning would result in an incongruous and visually intrusive addition that would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original dwelling and would be detrimental to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area. Therefore, the proposal would be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "The addition of a second bedroom would result in a 2-bedroomed dwelling with inadequate floorspace to accommodate existing and future occupiers of the dwelling, resulting in a poor quality and substandard form of residential accommodation as it would fall well below the nationally described space standards, all contrary to paragraph 130 (f) of the NPPF (2021) which seeks to ensure that development provides a high standard of amenity for its existing and future users as well as contrary to Policies DMHB 16 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021)."
