    "The proposed single storey side extension would result in a harmful loss of private amenity space for the occupiers at 5e Frays Waye, undermining the requirements for the provision of external amenity space for the existing occupiers at the site, failing to accord with Policies DMHD 1 and DMHB 18 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The proposed single storey side extension by reason of its size, scale, width, height and design would result in an incongruous, dominant, disproportionate, bulky and visually intrusive addition that would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original dwelling and would be detrimental to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area. Therefore, the proposal would be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020)."
