    "Due its irregular siting, design and size the proposed dwelling would form an uncharacteristic and incongruous addition to the area, which would fail to integrate the with the smaller scale of other garden development in the area. Due to the mentioned features, the dwellings site coverage and close proximity to the sites boundaries, as well as the fact that uncommonly small gardens would be provided for both the existing and proposed dwelling, the proposal is considered to be an overdevelopment of the site. The proposal would therefore  be detrimental to the visual amenity and character of the surrounding area,  contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies, Policies DMH 6, DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHB 18 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policies D1, D3 and D6 of the London Plan (2021), as well as paragraphs 71, 124 and 130 of the NPPF (2021).",
    "Due to its size, bulk, height, access and close proximity to neighbouring properties, the proposed dwelling would be detrimental to the amenities of the adjoining occupiers at Nos.109 and 107 Snowden Avenue Elm by reason of visual intrusion, sense of enclosure, loss of outlook, disturbance and loss of privacy.  It is therefore considered that the proposal would be contrary to Policy DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies.",
    "Due to its internal configuration and the absence of details to show that the internal layout would could comply with Building Regulation requirement M4(2), the proposal fails to demonstrate that adequate accessibility provisions would be provided to meet the needs of people with disabilities. The proposed development therefore conflicts with Policy D7 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The garden of the new dwelling would be of an inadequate size (33sqm) for occupants of the new 2 bedroom dwelling. The occupiers of the dwelling would therefore have poor standard of external amenity space, to the detriment of their future amenities and living conditions. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policy DMHB 18 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan and national guidance.",
    "This is a reminder that Under the terms of the Planning Act 2008 (as amended) and Community Infrastructure Levy Regulations 2010 (as amended), should an application for appeal be allowed, the proposed development would be deemed as 'chargeable development' and therefore liable to pay the London Borough of Hillingdon Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and the Mayor of London's Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This would be calculated in accordance with the London Borough of Hillingdon CIL Charging Schedule 2014 and the Mayor of London's CIL Charging Schedule 2012.",
