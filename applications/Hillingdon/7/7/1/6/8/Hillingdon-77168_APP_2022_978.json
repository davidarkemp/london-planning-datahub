    "The proposed single storey rear extension, by reason of its siting, size, depth and proximity would be detrimental to the amenities of the adjoining occupiers at No. 70 Elliott Avenue, by reason of overdominance, visual intrusion, overbearing impact and loss of outlook. As such, the proposal would be contrary to Policies DMHB 11, and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The proposed single storey rear extension, by reason of its visually incongruous roof design, would be detrimental to the form, proportion and appearance of the dwelling, relationship with neighbouring dwellings and overall character and appearance of the host dwelling. The proposed single storey rear extension is therefore not compliant with all the criteria set out Policy DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), it is considered that the proposal would cause harm to the character and appearance of the host dwelling and the surrounding area. The proposal therefore does not accord with the objectives of Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One Strategic (2012) and Policies DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020)."
