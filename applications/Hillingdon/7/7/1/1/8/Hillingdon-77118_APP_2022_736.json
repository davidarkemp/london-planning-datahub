    "The proposed development by reason of its bulk, size, siting, scale, design and massing would result in dominant, poorly designed, disproportionate extensions that fail to read as subordinate to the original dwelling and respect its architectural composition. The cumulative impact, overall footprint and excessive bulk would also fail to harmonise with the established local context, having a harmful visual impact on the character and appearance of the Burford Close and Applewood Close streetscenes and wider area. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012), Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021), Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The proposed two-storey side and rear extension, by reason of its siting, combined height, width and depth, would result in harm to the occupiers of no.12 Burford Close in terms of overdominance, loss of outlook and loss of daylight/sunlight to the roof level bedroom. The proposal would fail to comply with the requirements of Policies DMHD 1, DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2021). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020."
