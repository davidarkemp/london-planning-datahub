    "The proposed two storey rear extension, by reason of bulk, size, siting, scale, design and massing would result in a dominant, poorly designed and disproportionate development that would fail to read as subordinate to the original dwelling and respect its architectural composition. The cumulative impact, overall footprint and excessive bulk would also fail to harmonise with the established local context, having a harmful visual impact on the character and appearance of the Burford Close and Applewood Close streetscenes and wider area, reinforced because of its corner location and proposed partially flat crown roof. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012), Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021), Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2021). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020."
