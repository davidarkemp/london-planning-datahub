    "The proposal, by reason of the size, scale, bulk, design and siting of the rear dormer window would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original terraced property and terrace group, detrimental to the character and  appearance of the surrounding area and the visual amenities of the street scene. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "The proposed development, by virtue of its failure to maintain an adequate provision of private external amenity space, would have a harmful effect on the living conditions of the occupants of the host property. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policies DMHB 18 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
