    "The Lawson Cypress is situated within the rear garden of 7 Rogers Ruff, the majority of its canopy",
    "can be seen from the public highway and it has not been pruned before and as a result has a crown",
    "typical of this species. As a result it has a high amenity value and significantly contributes to the",
    "arboreal character of the Copse wood estate an area of special local character.",
    "Following the refusal of application 77154/TRE/2023/136 this new application includes a report from",
    "a Chartered Surveyor, they believe the damage has been caused by direct impact of the roots",
    "rather than subsidence or the weight of soil. No exploratory work has been completed to confirm",
    "this belief and determine the size of any roots present, without this, no argument has been provided",
    "to rule out alternatives to tree removal such as root pruning.",
    "The work is unjustified and will have a negative impact on the amenity of the area."
