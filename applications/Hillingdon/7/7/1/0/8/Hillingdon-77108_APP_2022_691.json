    "Insufficient detail has been provided to demonstrate that the required mitigation measures to protect residential amenity in terms of noise and odour pollution would not have a detrimental impact on the Grade II Listed Building, or to determine that they do not require separate Listed Building Consent. As such, the required conditions to protect residential amenity cannot be attached to a grant of planning consent. Therefore the Sui Generis Use is considered to have an unacceptable impact on the amenity of adjacent residential occupiers contrary to Policy D14 of London Plan (2021), Policy DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies (2012) and paragraph 130 of the National Planning Policy Framework.",
    "The use for which retrospective planning permission is sought has resulted in parking stress and associated congestion to the detriment of pedestrian and highway safety, as well as the amenities of local residents and these issues cannot be satisfactorily resolved through the use of planning conditions. The development is therefore contrary to Policies DMT 1, DMT 2, DMT 4 and DMT 6 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy T4 and T6 of the London Plan (2021) and paragraphs 111 and 130 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan (2021) and national guidance.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service."
