    "The proposed development by reason of its size, scale, bulk and design would result in a cramped, contrived and incongruous form of development that would fail to respect the architectural integrity of the host dwelling and result in the loss of an important gap. The proposal therefore fails to respect the established character and appearance of the building and wider area, contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies.",
    "The proposed development, by virtue of its size, scale, bulk, design and proximity, would be detrimental to the amenities of the adjoining occupiers at 22 and 23 Hyacinth Drive, by reason of overdominance, visual intrusion and loss of outlook. Therefore, the proposal would be contrary to Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant saved policies (referred to as policies from the Hillingdon Unitary Development Plan - Saved Policies September 2007), then London Plan Policies (2021). On the 8th November 2012 Hillingdon's Full Council agreed the adoption of the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies. Appendix 5 of this explains which saved policies from the old Unitary Development (which was subject to a direction from Secretary of State in September 2007 agreeing that the policies were 'saved') still apply for development control decisions."
