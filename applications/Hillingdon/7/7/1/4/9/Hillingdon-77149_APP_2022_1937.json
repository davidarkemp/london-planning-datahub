Therefore, the proposal would be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",

Therefore, the proposal would be contrary to Paragraph 137 and 147 of the National Planning Policy Framework as well as Policy DMEI 4 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020)."
