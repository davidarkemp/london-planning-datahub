    "The proposed two-storey rear extension, by virtue of size, scale, height and siting in proximity to shared boundaries, would result in a loss of outlook, overshadowing, sense of enclosure, overbearing impact for the neighbouring occupiers at numbers 10 to 20 Hallowell Road and their associated private amenity space. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One- Strategic Policies (2012), Policy DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The proposed first floor balconies serving Flats 2 and 5, by virtue of their siting, elevated height and proximity to the garden of the adjacent houses on Hallowell Road, would readily provide oblique views into these neighbouring properties private gardens. As a result, the proposal would give rise to overlooking and privacy issues for the neighbouring properties on Hallowell Road, contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One- Strategic Policies (2012), Policy DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The proposed development, by virtue of the single-aspect of the proposed studio flats 3 and 6, and the poor outlook from the front habitable elevation windows serving all six of the proposed flats which face onto an a private road entirely covered with tarmac in varied states of disrepair, would result result in substandard forms of residential accommodation to the detriment of future occupants. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy DMHB 16 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The proposed development, by virtue of the absence of any defensible space adjacent to the ground floor front habitable windows serving Flats 1 and 4, would cause unacceptable overlooking and a loss of privacy (both real and perceived) for the future occupants of these flats. The labelling of these habitable window as obscure glazed and non-opening up to 1.7 metres above ground level does not mitigate this harm, and raises additional issues in respect to loss of outlook and light.  The proposal would therefore result in a substandard form of internal residential accommodation to the detriment of the amenity of the future occupiers of Flats 1 and 4, contrary to Policies DMHB 15 and DMHB 16 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The proposed development, by virtue of position of the boundary treatment, proposed two-storey side extension and the two-storey building itself, would create a sense of enclosure, overshadowing issues, and an oppressive and unwelcoming sense of confinement to the ground floor windows of proposed flats 1 and 4 and their associated gardens. As a consequence, the proposal would provide substandard forms of residential accommodation to the detriment of future occupants.  The proposal would therefore result in a substandard form of internal residential accommodation to the detriment of the amenity of the future occupiers of Flats 1 and 4, contrary to Policies DMHB 15 and DMHB 16 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The propose development, by virtue of the proximity of the proposed opposing balconies serving proposed flats 2 and 5, would result in overlooking and loss of privacy for the future occupiers of these respective proposed flats. Furthermore, given the 'L-shape' of the proposed development with the balconies perpendicular to the principal rear elevation of the ground floor flat, and the proximity, would result in overlooking into the ground floor bedrooms of proposed flats 1 and 4. The proposal would therefore result in a substandard form of internal residential accommodation to the detriment of the amenity of the future occupiers of Flats 1 and 4, contrary to Policies DMHB 15 and DMHB 16 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The proposed development, by virtue of the inadequate size of the proposed first floor balconies serving Flats 2, 4, 5 and 6, the lack of privacy for the first floor balconies, and the lack of privacy, quality and functionality of the gardens serving Flats 1 and 4 , would result in substandard forms of external amenity space provision to the detriment of the living conditions of future occupants. The proposal therefore conflicts with Policy DMHB 18 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan - The Spatial Development Strategy for London consolidated with alterations since 2011 (2016) and national guidance.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "a) We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal.",
    "This is a reminder that Under the terms of the Planning Act 2008 (as amended) and Community Infrastructure Levy Regulations 2010 (as amended), should an application for appeal be allowed, the proposed development would be deemed as 'chargeable development' and therefore liable to pay the London Borough of Hillingdon Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and the Mayor of London's Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This would be calculated in accordance with the London Borough of Hillingdon CIL Charging Schedule 2014 and the Mayor of London's CIL Charging Schedule 2012.",
