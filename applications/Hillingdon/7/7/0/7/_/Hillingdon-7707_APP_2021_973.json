    "The site lies in a Critical Drainage Area (CDA) as identified in the Surface Water Management Plan (SWMP) for Hillingdon. A CDA is the catchment area from which surface water drains and contributes to drainage problems. All developments in this area must contribute to managing the risk of flooding from surface water by reducing surface water runoff from the site. Therefore the applicant should minimise the water from your site entering the sewers. No drainage to support the extension should be connected to any existing surface water sewer, other than as an overflow. Water run off from any roof or hard paving associated with  e development should be directed to a soakaway, or tank or made permeable. This includes any work to front gardens not part of the planning application, which must be permeable or be collected and directed to a permeable area, otherwise it would need an additional permission. A water butt should be incorporated."
