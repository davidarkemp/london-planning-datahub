    "The proposed single storey rear extension by reason of its bulk, mass, depth and scale, would fail to read as a subordinate addition to the house and would fail to respect its architectural integrity, representing a harmful addition to the character of the local area, all contrary to Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "The proposed single storey rear extension, by reason of its siting, width, depth, scale and proximity would be detrimental to the amenities of the adjacent occupiers of no.122 West Mead, in terms of overdominance, overshadowing, visual intrusion, overbearing impact, loss of daylight/sunlight and loss of outlook. Therefore, the proposal would be contrary to Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2021). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020."
