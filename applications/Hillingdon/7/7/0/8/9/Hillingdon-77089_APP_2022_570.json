    "The proposed single storey side/rear extension by reason of its size, scale, bulk, width, siting and proximity to the side boundary, in this open prominent position, would result in a cramped and incongruous addition which would fail to read as subordinate, whilst closing an important, characteristic gap. The proposal would therefore fail to harmonsie with the architectural composition of the original dwelling, symmetry of the pair and character and appearance of the streetscene, representing  an overdevelopment of the site. The proposed development is therefore contrary to  Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the  Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
