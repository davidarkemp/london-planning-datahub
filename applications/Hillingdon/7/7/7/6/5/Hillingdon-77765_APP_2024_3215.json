    "The proposal would create an independent, self-contained residential unit in a position where such a dwelling would be unacceptable. It would harm the character and appearance of the area, fail to provide acceptable living conditions for occupants of the outbuilding, and harm the amenity of neighbouring occupants/residents. The proposal is, therefore, contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2024), Policies D3 and D6 of the London Plan (2021), and Policies DMHD 2 and DMHB 11 of the  Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service."
