    "The proposed single storey side and rear extension, by virtue of its height, scale, mass, depth and proximity to the boundary and in the context of modestly proportioned development in the surrounding area, would have an unacceptable impact on the occupiers of the adjacent property at No. 20 Heather Lane and would result in an unacceptable overbearing impact, visual intrusion, and loss of outlook and natural light. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The proposed development, by reason of its cumulative size relative to the existing dwelling house, would not be subordinate to the host property and would fail to harmonise with the adjacent properties and the existing character and appearance of the local area. The development proposed, therefore, is considered to be contrary to Policy BE 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012) and Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020)."
