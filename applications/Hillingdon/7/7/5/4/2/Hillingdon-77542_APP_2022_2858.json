    "Due to its excessive width, depth, design and bulk, the proposed extension would form a oversized and addition to the host dwelling with a void exposed at the front, failing to read as subordinate or integrate successfully with the original architectural composition of the property and pair, harming its character and appearance. Additionally due to its siting, excessive size,  and blank flank elevation wall, the extension would form a prominent and unsightly addition to the streetscene, harming its appearance and that of the wider area. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy BE1 of the Local Plan Part 1 (2012), Policy DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan : Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021) and Paragraph 130 of the NPPF (2021).",
    "The proposed development, given the number of potential occupants across 9no. separate bedrooms would give rise to undue noise and general disturbance to neighbouring residents, particularly as a result of a marked increase in comings and goings, new car parking facilities in a hazardous location and proposed use of the rear garden. The proposal would therefore be contrary to the requirements of Policies DMH 5 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The proposed vehicular access is located within a hazardous position (within 5m of the junction between Bradenham Road and Weymouth Road). Due to its position, cars entering and existing the site would have poor visibility of cars coming around the corner,  greatly increasing the chances of collision. The applicant has also failed to demonstrate that the proposed vehicular access and crossover would comply with guidance set out within The London Borough of Hillingdon Domestic Vehicle Footway Crossover Policy 2022. The access shown on the submitted plans has no visibility splays and appears to be excessively wide , it would therefore endanger pedestrians crossing the site. The proposal is therefore considered to be contrary to Policy DMT 2 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy T4 of the London Plan (2021), paragraph 111 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021) and The London Borough of Hillingdon Domestic Vehicle Footway Crossove",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan (2021) and national guidance."
