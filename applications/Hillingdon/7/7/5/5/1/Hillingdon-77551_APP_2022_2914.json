    "The proposed telecommunications street pole and associated equipment, by virtue of their siting, size, scale, bulk and height, would represent incongruous, dominant and visually intrusive features in the street scene that would cause significant harm to the character and appearance of the local area and less than substantial harm to the setting of the nearby Grade II Listed Park Stockley Park Registered Park and Garden. The development would therefore be contrary to paragraphs 115, 130 c) and 195 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies D1, D4, D8 and SI6 of the London Plan (2021), Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012) and Policies DMHB 1, DMHB 2, DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHB 21 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The applicants have failed to provide robust evidence to demonstrate that other more suitable and less harmful sites do not exist, and that they have actively explored the possibility of erecting the proposed telecommunications equipment on existing buildings, masts or other structures. The development would therefore be contrary to paragraphs 115 and 117 c) of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy SI6 of the London Plan (2021) and Policy DMHB 21 of the  Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "In the absence of a tree report to BS5837:2012, with an arboricultural implications assessment, the applicant has failed to demonstrate that significant trees will be unaffected by the development and has not made provision for their long-term protection. Therefore the development would be contrary to Policies DMHB 12, DMHB 14 and DMHB 21 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020)."
