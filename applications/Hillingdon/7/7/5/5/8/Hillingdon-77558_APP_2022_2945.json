    "The proposed part single; part two-storey side and rear extension, by reason of its size, siting along the boundary, bulk, design and massing would result in a disproportionate, incongruous, dominant and overbearing addition that would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original dwelling, relationship with the attached pair and uniform row of properties, harmful to the streetscene and character and appearance of the area. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012), Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021), Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF).",
    "The proposed part single; part two-storey side and rear extension, by reason of its siting along the boundary, combined height, width, depth, bulk and massing would be detrimental to the occupiers of no.48 Stormount Drive in terms of overdominance, visual impact, overbearing impact and loss of outlook. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012), Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021), Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF).",
