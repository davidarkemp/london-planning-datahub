    "The side extension by reason of its siting, scale, form and design, would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original dwelling, resulting in a cramped appearance. Consequently the development proposal would harm the character, appearance and visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area, contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020) and Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021).",

Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020."
