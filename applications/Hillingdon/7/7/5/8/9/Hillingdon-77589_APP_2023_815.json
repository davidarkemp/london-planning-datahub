    "The proposed porch and proposed external grey rendering by reason of its size, scale, position, design, materials and appearance would diminish the prominence of the original flat roof feature and brick arch detailing, would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original dwelling and its adjoining pair, would be detrimental to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the street scene and would fail to either preserve or enhance, but would harm the character and appearance of the surrounding Eastcote Park Estate Conservation Area. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies BE1 and HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 1, DMHB 4 and DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), Policies D3 and HC1 of the London Plan (2021) and Chapters 12 and 16 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
