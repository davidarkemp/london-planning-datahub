    "The proposed two storey side/rear extension, by virtue of its size, scale, bulk and design, including the awkward setting of the proposed roof with the existing roof works, would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the host dwelling and would be detrimental to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area.  Therefore the proposal is contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020)."
