  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed conversion of the existing three-bedroom dwellings at No.s 156 and 158 Park Lane into 4 x flats would result in the loss of 2 residential dwellings that are suitably designed and appropriately sized (under 120sqm) for a family. The proposal would therefore unacceptably undermine the Borough's housing stock, contrary to Policy DMH 4 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy H10 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The proposed extensions and external alterations, by virtue of their location, design, size, scale, bulk, depth and height, would form oversized, dominant and irregular additions to No.s 156 and 158 Park Lane, harm their original architectural integrity and the character and appearance of the locality. The proposal is therefore considered to be contrary to Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the  Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020), as well as paragraph 130 of the NPPF (2021) and Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "The proposed development would result in a significant overprovision of substandard car parking at the site. This would be harmful to the character and appearance of the streetscene and locality and would also undermine sustainable modes of travel. The proposed parking layout and necessary dropped kerb would endanger pedestrians crossing the site, the sites vehicle users and car users of Park Lane. The design is therefore contrary to Policies DMT 2, DMT 6 and DMHB 14 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), as well as policy T4 and T6 of the London Plan (2021), paragraph 111 of the NPPF (2021) and The London Borough of Hillingdon Domestic Vehicle Footway Crossover Policy (2022).",
    "The ground floor bedrooms proposed within both Flats 1 and 2 would look directly onto the flank walls of neighbouring properties and would be directly overlooked by those using the side passage to access the rear garden (and associated facilities). The bedrooms therefore fail to provide adequate privacy and outlook for future occupiers, providing a substandard form of accommodation contrary to Paragraph 130 (f) of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021) and D6 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan (2021) and national guidance.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "a) We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal.",
    "This is a reminder that Under the terms of the Planning Act 2008 (as amended) and Community Infrastructure Levy Regulations 2010 (as amended), should an application for appeal be allowed, the proposed development would be deemed as 'chargeable development' and therefore liable to pay the London Borough of Hillingdon Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and the Mayor of London's Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This would be calculated in accordance with the London Borough of Hillingdon CIL Charging Schedule 2014 and the Mayor of London's CIL Charging Schedule 2012.",
