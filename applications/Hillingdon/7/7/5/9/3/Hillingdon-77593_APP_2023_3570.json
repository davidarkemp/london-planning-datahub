    "The proposed development, by reason of its siting in the garden of No.87 Woodcroft Crescent would fail to harmonise with the existing local context of the surrounding area. The principle of intensifying the residential use involving the loss of existing private garden area is unacceptable in principle and contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012), Policy DMH 6 of Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2023).",
    "Due to its uncharacteristic design, size, scale, bulk and projection forward of the established building line on Sutton Court Road, the proposed development would form an unduly prominent, incongruous, and visually harmful form of development within the street scene. As such it would be detrimental to the spacious character of the existing plot and Sutton Court Road street scene and surrounding area, contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012), Policies DMH 6, DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "The proposed development would fail to provide sufficient Gross Internal Floor Area for the proposed dwelling and would not provide sufficient high quality external amenity space for the occupiers of the host dwelling and the proposed dwelling, resulting in a substandard level of accommodation to the detriment of their amenities. The development would have a harmful effect on the living conditions of existing and future occupants, contrary to Policies DMHB 16, DMHB 18 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policies D3 and D6 of the London Plan (2021) and Paragraph 135f) of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan and national guidance.",
    "This is a reminder that Under the terms of the Planning Act 2008 (as amended) and Community Infrastructure Levy Regulations 2010 (as amended), should an application for appeal be allowed, the proposed development would be deemed as 'chargeable development' and therefore liable to pay the London Borough of Hillingdon Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and the Mayor of London's Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This would be calculated in accordance with the London Borough of Hillingdon CIL Charging Schedule 2014 and the Mayor of London's CIL Charging Schedule 2012.
