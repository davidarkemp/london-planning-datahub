    "Due to its uncharacteristic design, size, scale, bulk and projection forward of the established building line on Sutton Court Road, the proposed development would form an unduly prominent, incongruous, and visually harmful form of development within the street scene. As such it would be detrimental to the spacious character of the existing plot and Sutton Court Road street scene, surrounding area, contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), Policies D1, D3 and D6 of the London Plan (2021), as well as paragraphs 71, 124 and 130 of the NPPF (2021).",
    "The proposed development, on account of the amount of parking provided and its design, would result in overspill parking and the creation of a more hazardous environment for road users and pedestrians, as well as having an adverse impact on the free flow of traffic on the local highway network, contrary to Policies DMT 2 and DMT 6 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), as well as policy T4 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "Due to its design and position immediately in front of fenestration to the ground floor unit, the use of the parking space serving the 1st floor unit would cause disturbance and loss of privacy to occupiers, detrimental to their amenities and living conditions. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy D3 (D) of the London Plan (2021) and paragraph 130 (f) of the NPPF (2021).",
    "The proposed development would fail to provide sufficient high quality external amenity space for the future occupiers of the first floor flat, resulting in a substandard level of accommodation to the detriment of their amenities. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy DMHB 18 of the of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020) and paragraph 130 (f) of the NPPF (2021).",
    "The proposed conversion of the existing three-bedroom single dwelling at number 87 Woodcroft Crescent into 2 x 2-bedroom flats would result in the loss of a residential unit that is suitable and appropriately sized for a family without adequate reprovision of a family sized residential units. The proposal would therefore unacceptably undermine the supply of family housing within the Borough, contrary to Policies DMH 1, DMH 2 and DMH 4 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy H10 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan and national guidance.",
    "This is a reminder that Under the terms of the Planning Act 2008 (as amended) and Community Infrastructure Levy Regulations 2010 (as amended), should an application for appeal be allowed, the proposed development would be deemed as 'chargeable development' and therefore liable to pay the London Borough of Hillingdon Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and the Mayor of London's Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This would be calculated in accordance with the London Borough of Hillingdon CIL Charging Schedule 2014 and the Mayor of London's CIL Charging Schedule 2012.",
