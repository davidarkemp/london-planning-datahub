    "The large scale of the advertisement, in combination with the substantially-sized LCD screen and its prominent proposed location and luminance, would result in an obtrusive and cluttered public realm detrimental to the character and appearance of the street scene, failing to preserve the nearby Old Uxbridge / Windsor Street Conservation Area and safeguard the setting of the Grade II listed Civic Centre building. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies HE1 and BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), and DMHB 1, 2, 3, 4, 11, 12, 13A and 21 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and policies D3, D8 and HC1 of The London Plan (2021); and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021)."
