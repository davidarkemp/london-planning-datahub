    "The rear dormer roof extension and hip to gable end roof enlargement, by reason of its design, scale, bulk and siting would appear obtrusive within the street scene which will have a detrimental impact on the character and appearance of the surrounding area. Consequently, the roof alterations including rear dormer roof extension, are considered to introduce unsympathetic additions to the host dwelling that would have an adverse cumulative impact on the character and appearance of the wider area and this form of development is not characteristic in the local area. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policies BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), Policy D4 of the London Plan (2021) and the NPPF 2021.",
    "The roof alterations/extensions, and front extension, in combination with the two-storey side and part single and part two storey rear, by virtue of its siting in this visually prominent position, size, scale, bulk, width and design, fails to harmonise with the architectural composition of the group of terraced properties and is detrimental to the character and appearance of the host dwelling and results in the overdevelopment of the plot to the detriment of the visual amenities of the street scene and surrounding area. Therefore the proposal is contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service. We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation overcome the reasons for refusal given it is already built."
