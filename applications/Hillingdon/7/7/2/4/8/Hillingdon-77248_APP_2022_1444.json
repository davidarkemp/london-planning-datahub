    "Due to its design, height and excessive site coverage, the proposed dwelling would form an uncharacteristic, cramped and visually incongruous form of development which would fail to harmonise with the established character of the area and appearance of the street scene. The proposal would therefore be detrimental to the visual amenities of the streetscene and character of the surrounding area, all contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies, Policies DMH 6, DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policies D1 and D3 of the London Plan (2021), as well as paragraphs 124 and 130 of the NPPF (2021).",
    "Due to its height, design and close proximity to No.10,11 and 12 Maygoods View, the proposed dwelling would give rise to significant overlooking with unimpeded views into the rear windows of the mentioned properties, causing a unacceptable loss of privacy to their occupiers, which would harm their amenities. For the same reasons the new dwelling would also provide overlooking views into rear gardens of those properties, causing a further loss of privacy to the detriment of those neighbours amenities. The proposal is therefore considered to be contrary to policies DMHB 11 of the Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020) and paragraph 130 (f) of the NPPF (2021).",
    "2 parking spaces are required for the existing dwelling. 2 Parking spaces are required for the proposed dwelling. The proposal fails to demonstrate that 4 parking spaces would be provided for the resulting development. The shortfall in parking space provision is likely to result in roadside parking which would create a more hazardous environment for pedestrians and road users, whilst also causing traffic build up and congestion as vehicles stop to pass parked vehicles. Additionally no visibility splays, Vehicle access dimensions, cycle parking or electrical vehicle charging point details have been submitted. The proposed development is therefore considered to be contrary to Policies DMT 2, DMT 5 and DMT 6 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), as well as policy T4 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "The proposal fails to provide a step free access for the new dwelling and fails to meet the internal floorspace and layout standards set out in Diagram 27 of Approved Document M to the Building Regulations. The proposal is therefore considered to be contrary to Policy D7 A(2) of the London Plan, which requires all houses (which are created via works to which Part M volume 1 of the Building Regulations applies) meet Building Regulation requirement M4(2) 'accessible and adaptable dwellings'.",
    "The new 3 bed dwelling would be provided with 17sqm of private amenity space, this limited provision is considered to be poor, substandard and inadequate and it is therefore likely to provide its future occupants with poor external living environment to the detriment of their amenities. The existing 3 bedroom dwelling would be provided with 55sqm of private amenity space contrary to policy guidance , adversely impacting its occupiers. The proposed development is therefore considered to be contrary to Policy DMHB 18 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan (2021).",
    "This is a reminder that Under the terms of the Planning Act 2008 (as amended) and Community Infrastructure Levy Regulations 2010 (as amended), should an application for appeal be allowed, the proposed development would be deemed as 'chargeable development' and therefore liable to pay the London Borough of Hillingdon Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and the Mayor of London's Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This would be calculated in accordance with the London Borough of Hillingdon CIL Charging Schedule 2014 and the Mayor of London's CIL Charging Schedule 2012.",
