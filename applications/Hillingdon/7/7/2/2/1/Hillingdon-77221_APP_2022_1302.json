    "Pedestrian visibility splays of 2.4m by 2.4m shall be implemented and retained for the life of the development. Fences, walls and shrubs within these areas are to be kept to a maximum height of 0.6m. Vehicular splays should be provided in accordance with national recommendations, specifically Manual for Streets.",

    "The site lies in a Critical Drainage Area (CDA) as identified in the Surface Water Management Plan (SWMP) for Hillingdon. A CDA is the catchment area from which surface water drains and contributes to drainage problems. All developments in this area must contribute to managing the risk of flooding from surface water by reducing surface water runoff from the site. Therefore the applicant should minimise the water from the application site entering the sewers. No drainage to support the extension should be connected to any existing surface water sewer, other than as an overflow. Water run off from any roof or hard paving associated with the development should be directed to a soakaway, or tank or made permeable. This includes any work to front gardens not part of the planning application, which must be permeable or be collected and directed to a permeable area, otherwise it would need an additional permission. A water butt should be incorporated.",
    "The development requires the formation of a vehicular crossover, which will be constructed by the Council with the costs to be paid for by the applicant. This work is also subject to the issuing of a separate licence to obstruct or open up the public highway.  For further information and advice contact: - Highways Maintenance Operations, 4W/07, Civic Centre, Uxbridge, UB8 1UW."
