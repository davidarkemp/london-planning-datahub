    "The site is located in a tree protection area which is covered by TPO order 193. The development proposal includes the removal of a Council owned tree adjacent to the site which is outside the applicants control. In the absence of a tree survey, arboricultural method statement and tree protection plan, the application does not make adequate provision for the protection and long-term retention of the valuable tree and results in the loss of a protected tree that contributes positively to the local landscape character of the area. The application therefore conflicts with Policies DMHB 11 and DMHB 14 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policies G1 and G7 of the London Plan (2021) and Chapter 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021) and is refused.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "In order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably. In addition further guidance was offered to the applicant by the case officer during the processing of the application to identify the amendments to address those elements of the scheme considered unacceptable which the applicant chose not to implement."
