    "In the absence of any on-site measures or financial contribution for off-site measures to improve local air quality, the development cannot demonstrate that it would be at least air quality neutral. The removal of the requirement for the development to be air quality neutral would fail to reduce the air quality impacts of the development, contrary to planning policies. The proposed reduction in the level of parking provision approved under planning permission ref. 77265/APP/2022/2845 would conflict with the approved plans and therefore cannot be considered as a non-material amendment. As such, the application for a non-material amendment does not comply with Section 96A of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990, and would be contrary to Chapter 15 of the National Planning Policy Framework, London Plan Policy SI 1, Policy DMEI 14 of Hillingdon's Local Plan Part 2 - Development Management Policies, and London Plan Guidance: Air Quality Neutral. The application is therefore refused."
