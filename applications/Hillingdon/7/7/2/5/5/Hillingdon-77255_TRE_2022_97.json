    "Situated within the rear garden of 40 Kewferry Road is a large Leyland Cypress which can be seen from Moor Park Road over the properties. As a result, it has a moderate amenity value and significantly contributes to the Arboricultural character of the local area, which is adjacent to Dene Road, Northwood Area of Special Local Character (ASLC).",
    "A recent application to carry out tree surgery including a height reduction by 5m, trim sides in proportion without exposing dead foliage and remove overhanging branches up to a height of 10 metres to One Cypress T117 on TPO 90 was deemed appropriate due to the trees proximity to 43 Moor Park Road and approved on 11th May 2022. As a result of this recent approval removal is currently deemed unnecessary.",
    "Having regard to the reasons given for the proposed work, the work is unjustified and will have a detrimental impact on the visual amenity and arboreal character of the area.",
    "The removal of deadwood, dangerous / hanging branches and ivy:  This does not require the formal consent of the Council."
