    "The proposed telecommunications street pole and associated equipment, by virtue of their siting, size, scale, bulk and height, would represent incongruous, dominant, cluttered and visually intrusive features in the street scene that would cause significant harm to the character and appearance of the street scene and the wider area. The development would therefore be contrary to Policies D1, D4, D8 and SI6 of the London Plan (2021), Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012) and Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHB 21 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The Local Planning Authority considers that the applicants have failed to provide robust evidence to demonstrate that other more suitable and less harmful sites do not exist, and that they have actively explored the possibility of erecting the proposed telecommunications equipment on existing buildings, masts or other structures. The development would therefore be contrary to paragraphs 115 and 117 c) of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy SI6 of the London Plan (2021) and Policy DMHB 21 of the  Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The proposed telecommunications street pole and associated equipment, by virtue of the general siting, combined height, width and depth would be detrimental to the immediate amenities of the occupiers of nearby residential properties by reason of overdominance, visual intrusion and overbearing impact. Therefore the development would be contrary to Policy DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020)."
