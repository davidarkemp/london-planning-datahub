    "The proposed two-storey rear extension, by reason of its overall height, width and depth, would result in an exceessively large and  disproportionate addition that would fail to appear subordinate to the original property and would not harmonise with its architectural composition, detrimental to the visual amenities of the street scene and the surround area. Therefore, the proposal would be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012), Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF).",
    "The proposed two-storey rear extension, by reason of its overall height, width, depth and siting, would appear as an unduly dominant and overbearing feature that would result in a loss of outlook to the occupiers of No. 2 Tudor Way, which would compounded by the  overshadowing of their rear garden. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012), Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2021). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020."
