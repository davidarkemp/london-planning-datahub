Therefore, the proposal would be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012), Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021), Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF).",
