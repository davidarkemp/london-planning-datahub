    "The proposed development, by reason of its provision of facilities and the availability of independent access to it, is considered capable of independent occupation from the main dwelling. As a result, the proposal would be tantamount to a separate self-contained residential unit  which is undersized and poorly designed, in a position where such a dwelling would be unacceptable, due to requirements for parking and amenity space and the impact on adjoining properties. The proposal therefore conflicts with Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 16 and  DMHB 18, DMT 2 and DMT 6 of the  Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policies D6 and T6 of the London Plan (2021) and paragraphs 109 and 127 of the National Planning Policy Framework ."
