    "The proposed telecommunications street pole and associated equipment would, by virtue of their siting, size, scale, bulk and height, represent prominent and incongruous features in the street scene that would cause significant harm to the character and appearance of the street scene, the wider area, and the setting of the locally listed building at The Ascott Public House (Manor PH, No 144 Field End Road) and would fail to preserve or enhance the character or appearance of the adjacent Eastcote (Morford Way) Conservation Area. Furthermore, the proposed telecommunications street pole and associated equipment would have a detrimental impact on the visual amenities of the area, which includes views from upper floor flats at numbers 136 to 142 Field End Road.  The proposed development would therefore be contrary to paragraphs 115, 130 c) and 195 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies D4, D8, HC1 and SI6 of the London Plan (2021), Policies BE1 and HE1 of the Hillingdon L",
    "The Local Planning Authority considers that the applicants have failed to provide robust evidence to demonstrate that other more suitable and less harmful sites do not exist, and that they have actively explored the possibility of erecting the proposed telecommunications equipment on existing buildings, masts or other structures. The development would therefore be contrary to paragraphs 115 and 117 c) of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), and Policy DMHB 21 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020)."
