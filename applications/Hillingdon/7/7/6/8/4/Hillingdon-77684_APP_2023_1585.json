    "Due to the combination of its height, bulk, volume and excessive floorspace increase, the proposed extension is considered to form a disproportionate addition to the original building and to therefore constitute inappropriate development in the Green Belt. The extension would also cause visual harm to the openness of the Green Belt. No very special circumstances have been demonstrated to outweigh the developments substantial harm to the Green Belt. The development is therefore harmful to the Green Belt and contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework, Policy G2 of the London Plan (2021), Policy EM2 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policy DMEI 4 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "Due to its bulky and solid frontage, forward gable and two storey design, as well as the location within a rural area characterised by chalet style bungalows, the resulting dwelling would form an incongruous, unduly prominent and uncharacteristic addition to the area, which would be harmful to its streetscene, character and appearance. The resulting dwelling would therefore be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHD 1, DMHB 11, DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), as well as Policy D3 of the London Plan and paragraphs 130 (a) and (c) of the NPPF (2021).",
    "A first floor bedroom within the proposed extension would have no windows. With no windows it would provide its future occupier with no means of outlook or access to natural light. The occupier of the room would therefore be provided with a poor standard of amenity and living accommodation. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy DMHB 16, Policy D3 and Policy D6 of the London Plan , as well as paragraph 130(f) of the NPPF (2021).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal.",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan (2021) and national guidance.",
    "This is a reminder that Under the terms of the Planning Act 2008 (as amended) and Community Infrastructure Levy Regulations 2010 (as amended), should an application for appeal be allowed, the proposed development would be deemed as 'chargeable development' and therefore liable to pay the London Borough of Hillingdon Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and the Mayor of London's Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This would be calculated in accordance with the London Borough of Hillingdon CIL Charging Schedule 2014 and the Mayor of London's CIL Charging Schedule 2012.
