    "The proposed telecommunications street pole and associated equipment would, by virtue of their siting, size, scale, bulk and height, represent prominent and incongruous features in the street scene that would cause significant harm to the character and appearance of the Eastcote Village Conservation Area and the setting of the Grade II Listed Building at the Old Barn House. The proposed development would therefore be contrary to paragraphs 115, 130 c) and 195 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies D4, D8, HC1 and SI6 of the London Plan (2021), Policies BE1 and HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012) and Policies DMHB 1, DMHB 2, DMHB 4, DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHB 21 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The Local Planning Authority considers that the applicants have failed to provide robust evidence to demonstrate that other more suitable and less harmful sites do not exist, and that they have actively explored the possibility of erecting the proposed telecommunications equipment on existing buildings, masts or other structures. The development would therefore be contrary to paragraphs 115 and 117 c) of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), and Policy DMHB 21 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The application site is designated within a RAF Northolt 3km Buffer Zone. The information accompanied with the application fails to demonstrate that the developer has notified in writing (i) the Civil Aviation Authority, in respect of development on a civil safeguarding area; (ii) the Secretary of State for Defence, in respect of development on a defence safeguarding area; (iii) the operator of the civil safeguarding area (if the operator is not the Civil Aviation Authority) or defence safeguarding area (if the operator is not the Secretary of State for Defence). Furthermore, the information submitted fails to demonstrate that the development would not begin until the end of 28 days after the day the last notification required by paragraph (a) is given."
