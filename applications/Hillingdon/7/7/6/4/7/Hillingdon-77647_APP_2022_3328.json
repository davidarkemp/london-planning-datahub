  "description": "Proposed telecommunications installation: Proposed H3G 20m street pole and additional equipment cabinets (Application under Class A, Part 16 of Schedule 2 to the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended) for determination as to whether prior approval is required for siting and appearance).",
  "decision_date": "20/12/2022",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed telecommunications street pole and associated equipment would, by virtue of their siting, size, scale, bulk and height, represent prominent and incongruous features in the street scene that would cause significant harm to the character and appearance of the street scene, the wider area, and the setting of the Grade II Listed Building at Roman Catholic Church of St. Gregory & Church Hall. Furthermore, the proposed telecommunications street pole and associated equipment would have a detrimental impact on the visual amenities of the area, which includes views from neighbouring residential properties. The proposed development would therefore be contrary to paragraphs 115, 130 c) and 195 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies D4, D8, HC1 and SI6 of the London Plan (2021), Policies BE1 and HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012) and Policies DMHB 1, DMHB 2,  DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHB 21 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - D",
    "The Local Planning Authority considers that the applicants have failed to provide robust evidence to demonstrate that other more suitable and less harmful sites do not exist, and that they have actively explored the possibility of erecting the proposed telecommunications equipment on existing buildings, masts or other structures. The development would therefore be contrary to paragraphs 115 and 117 c) of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), and Policy DMHB 21 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The proposed telecommunication street pole and associated equipment, would infringe the Ministry of Defence height safeguarding criteria by approximately 7.7 metres, and would therefore disrupt airspace protected for visual manoeuvring prior to landing. Insufficient evidence has been submitted by the applicant to demonstrate otherwise. The proposed development would therefore adversely affect aviation safety, contrary to Policy DMAV 1 (Safe Operation of Airports) of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020) and paragraph 116(a) of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021)."
