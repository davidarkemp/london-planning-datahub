    "The proposed pitched/flat roof profile would result in an unduly prominent, visually incongruous and top-heavy form of development that would be detrimental to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the existing street scene on Walford Road and the surrounding area. The proposal therefore conflicts with Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012), Policies DMHD1, DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policies D1, D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The proposed raising of the roof to provide an additional level, by virtue of the ridge height and eaves height of the dwelling, would disrupt the appearance, rhythm and symmetry of the established roof scape in section of Walford Road. Consequently, the proposal would cause significant harm to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the host property, the street scene and the surrounding area. The proposal therefore conflicts with Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012), Policies DMHD1, DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policies D1, D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The proposed rear dormer, by reason of its excessive size, scale and bulk, coupled with its siting and design, would appear as incongruous and visually obtrusive form of development which would significantly detract from the roof form of the property and cause harm to the character and appearance of the surrounding area. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012), Policies DMHD1, DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policies D1, D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The proposed front canopy, by virtue of its siting, width and  design, would result in an un unduly dominant and uncharacteristic feature which would cause harm to the character and appearance of the host dwelling, the existing street scene on Walford Road and the surrounding area.  The proposal therefore conflicts with Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012), Policies DMHD1, DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policies D1, D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The proposed raising of the roof to provide an additional level, by reason of its proximity, depth, scale, bulk and height, would have a",
    "harmful impact on the living conditions of the occupiers at number 67 Watford Road and their associated private amenity space, in terms of loss of light, outlook, overdominance, sense of enclosure and overbearing impact. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012), Policies DMHD 1 and DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan - The Spatial Development Strategy for London consolidated with alterations since 2011 (2016) and national guidance.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "a) We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal.",
    "This is a reminder that Under the terms of the Planning Act 2008 (as amended) and Community Infrastructure Levy Regulations 2010 (as amended), should an application for appeal be allowed, the proposed development would be deemed as 'chargeable development' and therefore liable to pay the London Borough of Hillingdon Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and the Mayor of London's Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This would be calculated in accordance with the London Borough of Hillingdon CIL Charging Schedule 2014 and the Mayor of London's CIL Charging Schedule 2012.",
