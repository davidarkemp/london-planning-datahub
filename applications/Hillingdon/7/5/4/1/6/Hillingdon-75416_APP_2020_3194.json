  "description": "Creation of 2 x 2-bed and 3 x 1-bed self-contained flats within the roof level of the existing building involving alteration to the roof to include raising of ridge height, 16 dormers to front, 2 x 3 storey rear extensions to provide staircase access and associated external works",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed alterations to the roof involving increasing the ridge height and creation of 16 dormers, by reason of their size, scale, height, bulk, massing and design, would constitute an incongruous form of development, which would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original building and would be detrimental to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area including the adjacent Hillingdon Village Conservation Area. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 4, DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020) and Policies 3.5 and 7.4 of the London Plan (2016).",
    "The proposed 3 storey, flat roofed rear extensions, by reason of their size, scale, height, bulk, massing and design, would constitute an incongruous form of development, which would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original building and would be detrimental to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area including the adjacent Hillingdon Village Conservation Area. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 4, DMHB 11, DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020) and Policies 3.5 and 7.4 of the London Plan (2016).",
    "The proposed flats involving the creation of external staircases and footways would fail to provide an adequate level of amenity to existing and future occupants of the subject site by way of loss of light, outlook and privacy. The development would therefore be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policy DMHB 11 of the Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies and Policy 3.5 of the London Plan.",
    "The proposal has not demonstrated that sufficient off street parking/manoeuvring arrangements would be provided, and therefore the development is considered to result in substandard car parking provision, leading to on-street parking/queuing to the detriment of public and highway safety and contrary to policies DMT 2 and DMT 6 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020) and to Hillingdon's Adopted Parking Standards as set out in Appendix C of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan - The Spatial Development Strategy for London consolidated with alterations since 2011 (2016) and national guidance."
