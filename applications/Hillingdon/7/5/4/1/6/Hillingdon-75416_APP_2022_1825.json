    "Due to its excessive number of dormers, ridge height increases, resulting scale, prominent location, and 3x 3 storey, flat roofed rear extensions to create stairewells, it is considered that the proposed development would result in a poorly designed, top heavy, unduly prominent and uncharacteristic building which would fail to harmonise with the established scale,  character and appearance of the area. Subsequently the proposal would cause harm to the appearance of the street scene, visual amenities of the wider area and the setting of the adjacent Hillingdon Village Conservation Area. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 1, DMHB 4, DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), as well as Policies D1, D3 and HC1 of the London Plan (2021) and paragraphs 130 (a) and (c) of the NPPF (2021).",
    "The proposal would fail to provide a sufficient level of off-street parking, and therefore the development is considered to result in substandard car parking provision, leading to on-street parking/queuing to the detriment of public and highway safety and contrary to policies DMT 2 and DMT 6 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), London Plan Policies T4 and T6 and paragraph 109 of the NPPF (2021).",
    "New stairwell 3 would allow for residents of proposed Apartment G to have direct, short distance views into the living room of the first floor flat below, adversely impacting on the amenities of the properties existing occupiers and the amenities of future residents of the property by reason of privacy loss. The proposed development would therefore be contrary to Policy DMHB 11 of the Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and Paragraph 130 (f)  of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "No pedestrian footpath/cycle route will be provided for future residents leading from the dwellings to Cresent Parade Road/Uxbridge Road. As such new residents would have to walk or ride through the busy service yard and car park, to the mentioned roads. This could put them in danger from vehicles entering and existing the site. It is therefore considered that proposed development would create a dangerous, unwelcoming and hazardous environment for future residents of the scheme. The proposal is therefore considered to be contrary to paragraph 130 (f) of the NPPF (2021), D3 and T4 of the London Plan, DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMT2 and of the of the Hillingdon Local Plan : Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020)",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan (2021) and national guidance.",
    "This is a reminder that Under the terms of the Planning Act 2008 (as amended) and Community Infrastructure Levy Regulations 2010 (as amended), should an application for appeal be allowed, the proposed development would be deemed as 'chargeable development' and therefore liable to pay the London Borough of Hillingdon Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and the Mayor of London's Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This would be calculated in accordance with the London Borough of Hillingdon CIL Charging Schedule 2014 and the Mayor of London's CIL Charging Schedule 2012.",
