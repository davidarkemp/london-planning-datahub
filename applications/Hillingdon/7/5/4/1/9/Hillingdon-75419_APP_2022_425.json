A CDA is the catchment area from which surface water drains and contributes to drainage problems. All developments in this area must contribute to managing the risk of flooding from surface water by reducing surface water runoff from the site. Therefore the applicant should minimise the water from your site entering the sewers. Water run-off from any roof or hard paving associated with the development should be directed to a soakaway, or tank or made permeable. A water butt should be incorporated."
