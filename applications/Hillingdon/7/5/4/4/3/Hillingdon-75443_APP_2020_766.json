    "The proposed part two storey, part single storey rear extension by reason of its size, scale, bulk, depth and design, including its roof design and awkward juxtaposition with the roof works, would fail to appear as a subordinate addition and would thus fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original dwelling, would be detrimental to the character, appearance and symmetry of the small terrace of houses of which it forms a part and to the visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",

    "The proposed single storey rear extension, by virtue of its size, scale, bulk, height, depth and proximity, would be detrimental to the amenities of the adjoining occupier, by reason of overdominance, overshadowing, visual intrusion, loss of light and loss of outlook. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies.",
    "The proposed rear extensions, by virtue of its failure to maintain an adequate amount of private usable external amenity space for the occupiers of the extended property, would result in an over-development of the site detrimental to the residential amenity of existing and future occupiers. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies DMHD 1 and DMHB 18 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "The proposed front porch, by reason of its size, scale, bulk height, width and design would constitute an incongruous form of development that would appear out of proportion with the main house and would  be out of keeping with the overall appearance of the terrace to which the site relates. As such the porch would be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020)."
