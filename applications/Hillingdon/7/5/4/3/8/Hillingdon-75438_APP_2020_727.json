  "description": "Part two storey, part single storey side extension, single storey rear extension and conversion of roof space to habitable use to include 2 x front and 6 x rear roof lights involving demolition of existing garage",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed extension by reason of its size, scale, bulk, height and width, would represent a disproportionate change in the bulk and character of the original building and therefore would significantly increase the built up appearance of the site and would be visually intrusive within the street scene and the wider area. The proposal would therefore constitute inappropriate development in the Green Belt, contrary to Policies BE1 and EM2 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMEI 4, DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy 7.16 of the London Plan (2016) and the NPPF.",
    "The proposed two storey side/front extension and single storey side extension, by virtue of its size, scale, bulk and width, including the lack of set back from the front elevation, would fail to appear as subordinate additions and would thus, fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original dwelling. As such they would be detrimental to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies.",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2016). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service."
