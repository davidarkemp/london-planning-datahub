  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed extension, by virtue of its size, scale, bulk, depth and proximity, would be detrimental to the amenities of the adjoining occupier at 19 Townfield Square by reason of overdominance, overshadowing, visual intrusion, loss of light and loss of outlook. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies.",
    "The proposed extension, by reason of its size, scale, bulk and depth would fail to appear as a subordinate addition and would result in an incongruous form of development which would be detrimental to the character and appearance of the original dwelling and the surrounding local area. The proposal would, therefore, be contrary to Policy BE1  of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One Strategic Policies (2012) and Policies DMHB 11 and  DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2016). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020."
