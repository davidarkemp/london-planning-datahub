    "The proposed development includes the erection of a tall fence along the shared boundary with No.27 and the rear of the site in close proximity to the windows of the proposed studio flat. The proposal would therefore result in poor levels of outlook and light provision, resulting in a poor standard of living accommodation to the detriment of the amenities of future occupiers contrary to Policy DMHB 16 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020) and Policy D6 of The London Plan (2021).",
    "The proposed self-contained residential unit would have inadequate and poor quality private amenity space provision, giving rise to a substandard form of living accommodation to the detriment of the amenities of future occupiers. The proposal, therefore, conflicts, with Policy DMHB 18 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020) and Policy D6 of The London Plan (2021).",
    "No information has been submitted to demonstrate that the office unit is redundant and that there is no longer a local demand for the premises. The proposal would not meet the requirements of all local plan policies. Therefore the principle of development is unacceptable. The proposal, therefore, conflicts with Policy DMH 3 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The proposed external metal staircase, roof terrace and balcony enclosure to accommodate a roof terrace would be incongruous additions and detract from the character and appearance of the street scene and be harmful to the amenity of the area by reason of visual prominence, loss of privacy and overlooking to neighbouring properties. The proposed roof terrace would also give rise to a substandard and non-private form of amenity space to the detriment of the amenities of future occupiers. The proposal, therefore, conflicts, with Policies DMHB 11 and DMHB 18 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy D3 of The London Plan (2021) and Chapter 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2021). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service. We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal.",
    "This is a reminder that Under the terms of the Planning Act 2008 (as amended) and Community Infrastructure Levy Regulations 2010 (as amended), should an application for appeal be allowed, the proposed development would be deemed as 'chargeable development' and therefore liable to pay the London Borough of Hillingdon Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and the Mayor of London's Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This would be calculated in accordance with the London Borough of Hillingdon CIL Charging Schedule 2014 and the Mayor of London's CIL Charging Schedule 2012.
