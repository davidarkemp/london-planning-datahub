    "The proposed development includes the erection of a tall fence along the shared boundary to No.27 and the rear of the site in close proximity to the windows of the proposed studio flat. The proposed would therefore result in poor levels of outlook and light provision, resulting in a poor standard of living accommodation to the detriment of the amenities of future occupiers contrary to Policy DMHB 16 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy D6 of The London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The proposed self-contained residential unit would have inadequate and poor quality private amenity space provision, giving rise to a substandard form of living accommodation to the detriment of the amenities of future occupiers. The proposal, therefore, conflicts, with Policy DMHB 18 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy D6 of The London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "No information has been submitted to demonstrate that the office unit is redundant and that there is no longer a local demand for the premises. The proposal would not accord with minimum space and parking standards and therefore the principle of development is considered unacceptable. The proposal, therefore, conflicts, with Policy DMH 3 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "This is a reminder that Under the terms of the Planning Act 2008 (as amended) and Community Infrastructure Levy Regulations 2010 (as amended), should an application for appeal be allowed, the proposed development would be deemed as 'chargeable development' and therefore liable to pay the London Borough of Hillingdon Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and the Mayor of London's Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This would be calculated in accordance with the London Borough of Hillingdon CIL Charging Schedule 2014 and the Mayor of London's CIL Charging Schedule 2012. For more information on CIL matters please visit the planning portal page at: www.planningportal.gov.uk/planning/applications/howtoapply/whattosubmit/cil",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service. We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
