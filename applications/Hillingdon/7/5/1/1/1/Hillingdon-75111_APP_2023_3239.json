    "For the avoidance of doubt, the details show at the top left of approved drawing reference 'MWL-0471-SEW-GL-DR-L-100011 P11' shows the superseded canal access ramp design. The canal access ramp design details shown on the right side of approved drawing reference 'MWL-0471-SEW-GL-DR-L-100011 P11' are approved and are permitted for implementation in accordance with the requirements outlined Condition 10 (Canal Access Ramp Details) as attached to planning permission ref. 75111/APP/2022/1007.",
    "The Canal and River Trust have advised that the shrub planting should be low-level and maintained as such, to avoid growing out over the towpath or at eye level to prevent lines of sight to the access point (especially for those approaching from the west under the road bridge). The Trust would be happy to provide details on our 'Share the Space' signage to add to the proposed signage for people joining the towpath down the ramp, and which could also be added to railings and the proposed signpost. The applicant/developer is advised to contact Susannah Miller, Enterprise Manager (Susannah.miller@canalrivertrust.org.uk) to discuss this further.",
    "In addition, any works would need to adhere to the Trust's \"Code of Practice for Works affecting the Canal & River Trust\". The applicant/developer is advised to contact William Hardy, Infrastructure Works Engineer (William.hardy@canalrivertrust.org.uk) to discuss this further.",
