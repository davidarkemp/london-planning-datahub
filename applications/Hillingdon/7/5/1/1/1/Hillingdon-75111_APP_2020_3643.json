    "If, during development, contamination not previously identified is found to be present at the site then no further development (unless otherwise agreed in writing with the local planning authority) shall be carried out until a remediation strategy detailing how this contamination will be dealt with has been submitted to, and approved in writing by, the local planning authority. The remediation strategy shall be implemented as approved.",
    "REASONS",
    "To ensure that the development does not contribute to, and is not put at unacceptable risk from or adversely affected by, unacceptable levels of water pollution from previously unidentified contamination sources at the development site, in compliance with Policy DMEI 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 (2020) and paragraph 170 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2019).",
    "The decision to GRANT planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to GRANT planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan (2021) and national guidance.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably.",
    "It is possible that contaminating substances are present in the ground where excavation of the proposed cabling trenches is planned. We have received recent information concerning ground conditions at the site and we would advise persons working on site to take precautions in relation to any contamination they may discover and/or disturb. The possibility of contamination being present remains. Precautions should also be taken to minimise the mixing of any excavated material with clean shallow soils that are to remain on site.",
    "You are advised this development is on former industrial land. The advice is provided on the grounds of Health and Safety of the workers on site and to ensure the appropriate restoration of the site once works are complete to minimise risk to other workers and occupants of the site. The suitability of materials and excavating techniques etc may also need to be considered under the Building Regulations.",
    "The applicant/developer should refer to the current \"Code of Practice for Works affecting the Canal & River Trust\" to ensure that any necessary consents are obtained (https://canalrivertrust.org.uk/business-and-trade/undertaking-works-on-our-property-and-our-code-of-practice)",
    "The applicant is advised that part of the land required for the proposed works is public highway. The works proposed on this land will require a Section 50 licence (New Roads and Street Works Act 1991)."
