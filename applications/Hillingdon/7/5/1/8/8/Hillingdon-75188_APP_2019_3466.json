    "In the absence of sufficient and accurate information relating to the use of the proposed extension, how it relates to the use of the main building, whether the facilities proposed within the extended building are to be removed from the existing building and whether this will result in an increase in the capacity of the main building or/and a greater intensity of use, the proposed development would result in unacceptable impacts on adjoining residential occupiers by reason of increase in activity, noise and disturbance and impact on traffic, highways and parking. The proposal is thus contrary to Policies EM8 and BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMCI 2, DMT 2 and DMT 6 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan - The Spatial Development Strategy for London consolidated with alterations since 2011 (2016) and national guidance.",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2016). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020."
