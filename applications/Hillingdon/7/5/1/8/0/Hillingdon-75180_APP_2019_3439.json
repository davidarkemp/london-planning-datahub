  "description": "Application for Permission in Principle (PIP) for the erection of 3 terraced properties comprising 2 no. two storey, two-bedroom four-person terraced houses, and 1 no. two storey three-bedroom five- person terraced house, involving retention of the end of terrace property 43 Woodstock Gardens and the demolition of a two storey detached dwelling and associated single storey outbuildings  within the grounds of 43 and 43a Woodstock Gardens.",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed development, by reason of its siting in the gardens of 43 and 43A Woodstock Gardens would fail to harmonise with the existing local and historic context of the surrounding area. The principle of intensifying the residential use involving the loss of existing private garden area is unacceptable in principle and contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policy H12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Saved UDP Policies (November 2012), Policy DMH 6 of the emerging Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies with Modifications (March 2019), Policy 3.5 of the London Plan (2016), guidance within The London Plan Housing Supplementary Planning Guidance (March 2016) and the National Planning Policy Framework (February 2019).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Unitary Development Plan Saved Policies (September 2007) as incorporated into the Hillingdon Local Plan (2012) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan - The Spatial Development Strategy for London consolidated with alterations since 2011 (2016) and national guidance.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the 'Saved' UDP 2007, Local Plan Part 1, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as making available  a full pre-application advice service. We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
