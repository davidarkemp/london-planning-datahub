  "description": "Conversion of two-storey maisonette into 2 x self-contained studio flats",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed conversion of the two storey maisonette at number 161 Wordsworth Way into two studio flats would result in the loss of a residential unit that is suitable for a family. The proposal would have a detrimental effect on the supply of family housing within the Borough, contrary to Policy DMH 4 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and paragraph 67 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2019).",
    "The proposal would provide an indoor living area of an unsatisfactory size for the future occupiers of the ground floor unit and would therefore give rise to a substandard form of living accommodation to the detriment of the amenity of future occupiers. The proposal would therefore conflict with Policy DMHB 16 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy 3.5 and Table 3.3 of the London Plan (2016), the Housing Standards Minor Alterations to The London Plan (2016), the Mayor of London's adopted Supplementary Planning Guidance - Housing (2016), the Technical Housing Standards - Nationally Described Space Standard (2015) and paragraph 127 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2019).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan - The Spatial Development Strategy for London consolidated with alterations since 2011 (2016) and national guidance.",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2016). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020."
