    "The proposed two storey side extension and part two storey, part single storey rear extension, by reason of its position, excessive size, scale, bulk, width, depth and design, would result in an incongruous addition which would engulf and be detrimental to the appearance of the original and adjoining properties, the visual amenities of the street scene and the character and appearance of the wider area. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "The proposed extension, by reason of its projection forward of the recognised established return line along Townfield Road on this corner plot, is considered to represent an unduly intrusive and incongruous form of development within the street scene and would not appear sufficiently subordinate to the dwelling or the street scene. As such, the proposal would be harmful to the visual amenities of the street scene and open spacious character of this plot and surrounding area, contrary to  Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2016). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. The Council's supports pre-application discussions.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
