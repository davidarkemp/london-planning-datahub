  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposal is for a detached structure which, by reason of its size, scale, layout and independent access, is considered capable of independent occupation from the main dwelling and is thus tantamount to a separate dwelling in a position where such a dwelling would not be acceptable as it could result in unacceptable impact on adjoining occupiers and additional requirements for parking and amenity space. The proposal is therefore contrary to policies DMHB 11, DMHD 2, DMHB 18 and DMT 6 of the London Borough of Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two-Development Management Policies and Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "The proposed outbuilding, by reason of its design and appearance would be a discordant and incongruous addition which would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the host dwelling and would be detrimental to the character and appearance of the surrounding area. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11, DMHD 1 and DMHD 2 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2016). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020."
