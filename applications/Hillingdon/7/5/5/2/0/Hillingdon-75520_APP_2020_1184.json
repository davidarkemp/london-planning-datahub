    "The proposed development by reason of its siting and overall height in a prominent location on an exposed corner road junction,  would result in an incongruous and visually obtrusive form of development. It would harm the character and appearance of the street scene, which is mainly characterised by two storey buildings and would harm the setting of the adjoining Locally Listed Venue 5 Public House, 446 Field End Road. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies BE1, HE1 and EM2 of The Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies (2012), Policies DMHB 1, DMHB 3, DMHB 11, DMHB 21 and DMEI 6 of The Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy 7.8 of the London Plan (2016) and Chapter 5 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2019).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan - The Spatial Development Strategy for London consolidated with alterations since 2011 (2016) and national guidance.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "a) We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal.",
    "The applicant is advised that Field End Junior School on Field End Road lies approximately 120m to the south of the site."
