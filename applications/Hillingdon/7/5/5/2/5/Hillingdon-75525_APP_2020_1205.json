The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies BE1 and HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 1, DMHB 4 and DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), Policy 7.8 of the London Plan (2016) and the NPPF.",

    "The proposal would provide an indoor living area of an unsatisfactory size and quality for the future occupiers of the three bedroom flat and would therefore give rise to a substandard form of living accommodation to the detriment of the amenity of future occupiers. The proposal is thus contrary to Policy DMHB 16 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), Policy 3.5 and Table 3.3 of the London Plan (2016), the Housing Standards Minor Alterations to The London Plan (March 2016), the Mayor of London's adopted Supplementary Planning Guidance - Housing (March 2016) and the Technical Housing Standards - Nationally Described Space Standard (March 2015).",
    "The proposed development, by virtue of its failure to provide useable private outdoor amenity space of sufficient size and quality commensurate to the size and layout of the proposed three bedroom flat would result in an over-development of the site detrimental to the residential amenity of future occupiers. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy DMHB 18 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
