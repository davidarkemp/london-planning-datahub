    "The proposed works, by virtue of of the cumulative number of existing and proposed signs and external lighting being proposed, coupled with their size, position, colour and inappropriate design, would fail to preserve or enhance the significance, character or appearance of the Grade II Listed Building at 118 High Street and its setting, thus causing harm to its special interest and significance. The proposal would therefore conflict with the Policy HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 1 and DMHB 2 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two- Development Management Policies (January 2020), Policy HC1 of the London Plan (March 2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (July 2021).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "a) We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
