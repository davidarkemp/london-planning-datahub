    "The single storey front/side extension, by reason of its, siting in this visually prominent position, size, scale, bulk, excessive width and design would represent an incongruous and visually intrusive form of development which would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original dwellings and to the visual amenities of the street scene and the local area. Therefore, the proposal,  would be contrary to Policies BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
