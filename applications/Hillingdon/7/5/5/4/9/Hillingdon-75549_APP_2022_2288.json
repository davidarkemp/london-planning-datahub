    "The constructed development, by virtue of the hip to gable conversion, has resulted in a loss of symmetry between the semi-detached houses at numbers 49 and 51 York Road which has caused harm to the visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area. The proposal therefore conflicts with Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012), Policies DMHD1, DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The constructed development, by virtue of the excessive size, scale and bulk of the rear dormer, coupled with its design, appears as an incongruous and visually obtrusive form of development which significantly detracts from the original form of the property to the detriment of the character, appearance and visual amenities of the surrounding area. The proposal therefore conflicts with Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012), Policies DMHD1, DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The constructed development, by virtue of the introduction of the dark grey roof tiles in replacement of the former red/brown roof tiles on the original host dwelling, has resulted in harm to the character and appearance of the host dwelling, the existing street scene and the surrounding area. The proposal therefore conflicts with Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012), Policies DMHD1, DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The constructed development, by virtue excessive height, scale and design of the raised terraced and fencing along the mutual boundary shared with number 49 York Road, appear as visually discordant features that are out of keeping with the character, appearance and visual amenities of the host dwelling and the surrounding area. The proposal therefore conflicts with Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012), Policies DMHD1, DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The constructed development, by virtue of the proximity, length and excessive height of the side (south) boundary fencing, has resulted in a harmful impact on the living conditions of the neighbouring occupiers at number 49 York Road  and their associated private amenity space, in terms of loss of outlook, sense of enclosure and overbearing effect. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies DMHD 1 and DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021) and paragraph 130 f) of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The constructed development, by virtue of the proximity, length, and excessive height of the rear raised terrace, has resulted in a harmful impact on the living conditions of the neighbouring occupiers at number 53 York Road and their associated private amenity space, in terms of loss of privacy and overlooking. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies DMHD 1 and DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021) and paragraph 130 f)  of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2021). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
