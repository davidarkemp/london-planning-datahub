    "The proposed part two storey, part single storey rear extension by reason of its size, scale, bulk, depth and design, including its roof design and awkward juxtaposition with the roof works, would fail to appear as a subordinate addition and would thus fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original dwelling, would be detrimental to the character, appearance and symmetry of the small terrace of houses of which it forms a part and to the visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "The proposed side extension by reason of its awkward design and position would constitute an incongruous form of development that would appear out of proportion with the main house and would  be out of keeping with the overall appearance of the terrace to which the site relates and the wider streetscene.. As such the side extension would be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "The Council's records show that there is no planning permission for the extensions and their use as a separate single family dwelling currently known as 24A Rectory Road, the subject of this planning application. As such the existing extensions and their use are unlawful and could be the subject of enforcement action."
