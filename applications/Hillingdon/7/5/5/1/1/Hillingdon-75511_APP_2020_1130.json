  "description": "Part single storey, part two storey rear extension, single storey front extension and conversion of roof space to habitable use to include extensions to front and rear of the existing roof space, 2 side dormers, 4 rear roof lights, 4 side roof lights, conversion of the both side of roof from hip to dutch gables, alterations to elevations and demolition of existing rear conservatory",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed development by reason of the conversion of the side hips to dutch gables, the size scale, bulk and design of the front and rear extensions and the overall cumulative size, scale and design, would represent a visually unsympathetic form of development that would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original dwelling and would be detrimental to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the street scene. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "The proposed conversion of the side hip to dutch gable, by reason of its size, scale, bulk and proximity, would be detrimental to the amenities of the adjoining occupier at 24 Keswick Gardens by reason of overdominance, overshadowing, visual intrusion, loss of light and loss of outlook. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "The proposal would result in the provision of a first floor habitable rooms with no outlook and poor levels of light and would therefore give rise to a substandard form of living accommodation and reliance upon artificial means of lighting which would fail to satisfy sustainability and energy efficiency objectives and would be to the detriment of the amenity of future occupiers, contrary to Policies 3.5 and 5.3 of the London Plan (March 2016) and Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2016). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service."
