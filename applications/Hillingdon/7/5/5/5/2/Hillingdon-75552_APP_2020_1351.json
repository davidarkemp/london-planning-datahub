  "description": "Erection of a detached two storey 4-bed dwelling with associated parking and amenity space",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed development, by reason of its size, scale, bulk, height and design, would result in a poor and incongruous form of development that would be detrimental to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding North Uxbridge Area of Special Local Character. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies BE1 and HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 1, DMHB 5, DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), Policy 7.8 of the London Plan (2016) and the NPPF.",
    "The proposal would result in the provision of a habitable room (Bedroom 4) with no outlook and limited levels of natural lighting that would result in a substandard form of living accommodation and reliance upon artificial means of lighting which would fail to satisfy sustainability and energy efficiency objectives and would be to the detriment of the amenity of future occupiers, contrary to Policies DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and Policies 3.5 and 5.3 of the London Plan (2016).",
    "The proposed development, by virtue of the poor internal layout of the proposed W/C at ground floor level would fail to provide a dwelling which is  accessible and adaptable to the detriment of the amenity of future occupiers. The proposal is thus contrary to Policies 3.8 and 7.2 of the London Plan (2016) and the Technical Housing Standards - Nationally Described Space Standard (March 2015).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan - The Spatial Development Strategy for London consolidated with alterations since 2011 (2016) and national guidance.",
    "The Local Planning Authority (LPA) is in receipt of planning application Ref: 75552/APP/2020/2236 which is pending consideration and relates to the adjoining plot of land. It is considered that in order to fully assess the impact of the proposals forming part of this pending application and the application now hereby refused a single planning application for both houses should be submitted to the LPA for their consideration."
