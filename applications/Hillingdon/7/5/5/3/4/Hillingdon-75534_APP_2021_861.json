    "The proposed dwellinghouse, by virtue of its position in this open space, as well as the replacement parking spaces, would be detrimental to the open character, appearance and visual amenities of the street scene and surrounding area. Furthermore, it has not been demonstrated that the open/amenity spaces to be lost to the development are surplus to requirements. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 11 and DMCI 3 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and the NPPF sections 8 and 12.",
    "The proposed dwelling, by reason of its size, position and proximity, would be detrimental to the amenities of the adjoining occupiers at 33 Brambles Farm Drive, by reason of overdominance and loss of outlook. Furthermore, the submitted Daylight and Sunlight Report has failed to demonstrate that the proposal would not cause harmful loss of light to 33 Brambles Farm Drive if the rear extension to that property is not constructed. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies.",
    "The proposed development, in the absence of a Section 106 legal agreement, fails to provide contributions towards the improvement of services and facilities as a consequence of demands created by the proposed development (in respect of the reprovision of 9 communal parking spaces). The scheme therefore conflicts with Policy DMCI 7 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two Development management Policies (2020), the London Borough of Hillingdon Supplementary Planning Document on Planning Obligations, Policy DF1 of the London Plan (2021) and paras 55-58 of the NPPF (2021).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan (2021) and national guidance.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "In addition, further guidance was offered to the applicant by the case officer during the processing of the application and additional information was accepted during the course of the application in order to give the applicant the opportunity to address matters raised.",
    "This is a reminder that Under the terms of the Planning Act 2008 (as amended) and Community Infrastructure Levy Regulations 2010 (as amended), should an application for appeal be allowed, the proposed development would be deemed as 'chargeable development' and therefore liable to pay the London Borough of Hillingdon Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and the Mayor of London's Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This would be calculated in accordance with the London Borough of Hillingdon CIL Charging Schedule 2014 and the Mayor of London's CIL Charging Schedule 2012.",
