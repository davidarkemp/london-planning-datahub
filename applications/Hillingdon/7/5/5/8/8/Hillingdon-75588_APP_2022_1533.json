    "The two-storey side extension, by reason of its design and siting, including the flat roof, blank front elevation, large side window and materiality, results in a dominant, excessive, bulky, unsympathetic, incongruous and visually intrusive addition that fails to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original dwelling and terrace row, subsequently harming the character and appearance of the site, streetscene and public open space adjacent. Therefore, the proposal is contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012) and Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2021). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020.",
    "The submitted plans have been labelled as being existing and proposed when they should be 'pre-existing' and 'existing' given the works have been undertaken. That being said, officers note the retrospective nature and submitted application to regularise the works.",
    "This application has not assessed any new alterations and is purely for the retention of the existing structure."
