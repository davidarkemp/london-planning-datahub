  "decision_conditions": [
    "In the absence of a Flood Risk Assessment in accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework and National Planning Practice Guidance, the application has failed to address the issues relating to flood risk and the proposal is therefore contrary to Policy EM6 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policy DMEI 9  of the Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy 5.12 of the London Plan (2016) and the NPPF.",
    "The proposed side and front extension, by reason of their size, scale, bulk, excessive height and forward projection, would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original dwelling and would be detrimental to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2016). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service."
