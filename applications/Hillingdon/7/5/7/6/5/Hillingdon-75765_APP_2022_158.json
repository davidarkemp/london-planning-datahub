    "The security fence has resulted in the loss of the verdant landscaped area. It forms a particularly prominent and visually harsh form of boundary treatment which detracts from the attractive approach to Regents Close and has a significant enclosing effect. As such, the erection of a fence and enclosure of this land is detrimental to the visual amenity of the surrounding area and as such, would be in conflict with Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan - Part 1 (2012), Policy DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHB 14 of the Hillingdon Local Plan - Part Two (2020) and policies D3 and D8 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate a satisfactory policy-led approach to the proposed fencing in relation to impact on vehicle and pedestrian visibility splays. Consequently, the development would be prejudicial to all road users safety, contrary to the NPPF (2021), Policy DMT 1 and DMT 2 of the Hillingdon Local Plan - Part Two (2020), and London Plan (2021) Policy T4.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
