  "description": "Part two storey, part single storey side extension and conversion of roofspace to habitable use to include a rear dormer (Resubmission)",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed two storey side extension, by reason of its size, scale, bulk and increase in the pitch of the main roof, would result in an incongruous addition which would would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original dwelling, would be detrimental to the character, appearance and symmetry of the small terrace of houses of which it forms a part and to the visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The roof alteration/extensions, by reason of the size, scale, bulk, and design of the rear dormer window would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original dwelling and would be detrimental to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The proposal, by reason of its size, scale, design and proximity to the side boundary, would result in a closing of the visually open gap between it and the neighbouring property, No. 105 Lime Grove, giving rise to a cramped form of development and terracing effect, which would be detrimental to the visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area generally. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2016). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020.",
