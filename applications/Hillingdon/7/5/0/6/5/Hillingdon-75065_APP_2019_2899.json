    "The proposed installation of the telecommunications monopole, combined with the equipment cabinets and the electrical metre cabinet, would increase street clutter along this section of Church Road, resulting in a detrimental impact on the character and appearance of the immediate street scene, the surrounding area and the neighbouring Hayes Village Conservation Area. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies BE4, BE13 and BE37 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Saved UDP Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 4, DMHB 11 and DMHB 21 of the emerging Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies With Modifications (March 2019) and Chapter 10 of the National Planning Policy Framework (March 2012).",
