  "description": "Retention of raised patio and timber boundary fence comprising close boarded panels and a trellis top (Retrospective)",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The timber boundary fencing comprising close boarded panels and a trellis top, by virtue of its siting, length and excessive height, has a harmful impact on the living conditions of the neighbouring occupiers at numbers 31 and 35 Dawlish Drive and their associated private amenity space, in terms of loss of outlook, visual intrusion, overdominance, sense of enclosure and overbearing impact. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies DMHD 1 and DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The raised patio, by reason of its siting, depth and excessive height, has caused harm to the living conditions of the neighbouring occupier at number 31 Dawlish Drive and their associated private amenity space, in terms of loss of privacy and overlooking. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies DMHD 1 and DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "a) We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal.",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2016). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020."
