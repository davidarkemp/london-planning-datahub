    "The Oak tree can be seen from within the public grounds of Manor Farm and the public highway (Pinn Way). It has a moderate to high amenity value and significantly contributes to the arboreal characteristics of the local area and is situated within Ruislip Village Conservation Area.",
    "The applicant's first reason for removal is that he believes the tree is diseased however he has marked No to question 8.1 Condition of the tree and has not provided any Arboricultural evidence to support his claim. It is noted that there is concern about deadwood within the tree, however the removal of deadwood is exempt from the application process and can be removed. The Oak tree is situated to the South of the neighbour's summer house and garden (4 Pinn Way) and therefore will provide some shading to their property, however the benefits of this tree to the amenity of the local area is seen to greatly outweigh any negative impacts perceived by the neighbour.",
    "Having regard to the reasons given for the pro",
    "The removal of deadwood, dangerous / hanging branches and ivy:  This does not require the formal consent of the Council."
