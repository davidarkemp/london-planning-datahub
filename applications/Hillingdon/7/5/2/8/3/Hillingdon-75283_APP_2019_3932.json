No works shall be carried out on Sundays, Bank or Public Holidays.",
    "B. All noise generated during such works shall be controlled in compliance with British Standard Code of Practice BS 5228:2009.",

The applicant's attention is drawn to the requirement within the British Standard Code of Practice for the safe use of Cranes, for crane operators to consult the aerodrome before erecting a crane in close proximity to an aerodrome.  This is explained further in Advice Note 4, 'Cranes and Other Construction Issues' (available at www.aoa.org.uk/publications/safeguarding.asp)"
