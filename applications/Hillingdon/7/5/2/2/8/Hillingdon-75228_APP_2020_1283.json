  "description": "Single storey side extension, part two storey, part single storey rear extension and single storey outbuilding for use as a games/gym room and garden store",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed first floor rear extension, by reason of its roof design and the relationship between the roof of the proposed extension and the existing rear dormer roof extension, would appear as a disproportionate and unsympathetic addition to the original dwelling and would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original semi-detached dwelling, would be detrimental to the character, appearance and symmetry of the pair of semi-detached houses of which it forms a part and to the visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area.",
    "The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policies DMHD1 and DMHB 11 of Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2016). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "The Council has however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
