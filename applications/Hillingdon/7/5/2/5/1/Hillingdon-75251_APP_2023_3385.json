    "The submitted documentation confirms that the building was not vacant for a period of 3 months immediately prior to the date the application was submitted. The application submission therefore fails to accord with Schedule 2, Part 3, Class MA.1.(1)(a) of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development)(England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "Insufficient information has been submitted in respect of the loss of the nursery service and the application submission fails to accord with Schedule 2, Part 3, Class MA.2.(2)(h) of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development)(England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "The proposed development fails to accord with nationally described space standard issued by the Department for Communities and Local Government on 27th March 2015, contrary to Article 3 paragraph (9A) of The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "This is a reminder that Under the terms of the Planning Act 2008 (as amended) and Community Infrastructure Levy Regulations 2010 (as amended), should an application for appeal be allowed, the proposed development would be deemed as 'chargeable development' and therefore liable to pay the London Borough of Hillingdon Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and the Mayor of London's Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This would be calculated in accordance with the London Borough of Hillingdon CIL Charging Schedule 2014 and the Mayor of London's CIL Charging Schedule 2012.",
