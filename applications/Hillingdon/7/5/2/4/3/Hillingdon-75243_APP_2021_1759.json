    "The proposed development, by reason of its siting (in a rear garden), uncharacteristic design, bulk, scale, layout, and site coverage, would result in a cramped development of the site, which is visually incongruous  and would fail to harmonise with the existing local and historic context of the surrounding area. The principle of intensifying the residential use of the site to the level proposed, as well as the proposed loss of existing private rear garden area would have a detrimental impact on the character, appearance and visual amenity of the residential area as a whole. The proposal is therefore considered to be detrimental to the visual amenity and character of the surrounding area, contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies, Policies DMH 6, DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policies D1, D3 and D6 of the London Plan (2021), as well as paragraphs 71, 124 and 130 of the NPPF (",
    "The proposal has not demonstrated that sufficient off street parking/manoeuvring/access arrangements would be provided for the existing and proposed dwellings, and therefore the development is considered to result in substandard car parking provision, leading to on-street parking/queuing to the detriment of public and highway safety and contrary to policies DMT 2 and DMT 6 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020) and to Hillingdon's Adopted Parking Standards as set out in Appendix C of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "The bathrooms within the proposed dwelling fail to meet the requisite space standards set out in in Diagram 27 of Approved Document M to the Building Regulations. They also fail to provide the required clear access zones set out in in Diagram 27 of Approved Document M to the Building Regulations. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy D7 A(2) of the London Plan, which requires all houses (which are created via works to which Part M volume 1 of the Building Regulations applies) meet Building Regulation requirement M4(2) 'accessible and adaptable dwellings'.",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
