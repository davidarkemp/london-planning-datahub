    "The proposal, by virtue of the siting and location of the flue and its proximity to adjoining residential occupiers, would be detrimental to the  amenities of these occupiers by reason of unacceptable odours, cookings smells, noise and disturbance. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy DMTC 4 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Saved Policies (2020) as incorporated into the Hillingdon Local Plan (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including the London Plan (July 2016) and national guidance.",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant saved policies (referred to as policies from the Hillingdon Unitary Development Plan - Saved Policies September 2007), then London Plan Policies. On the 8th November 2012 Hillingdon's Full Council agreed the adoption of the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies. Appendix 5 of this explains which saved policies from the old Unitary Development (which was subject to a direction from Secretary of State in September 2007 agreeing that the policies were 'saved') still apply for development control decisions.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the 'Saved' UDP 2007,  Local Plan Part 1, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably."
