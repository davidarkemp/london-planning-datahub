    "The proposed part two storey, part single storey rear extension, by virtue of its size, scale, bulk, height and depth would be detrimental to the amenities of the adjoining occupiers at 12 Heathfield Rise, by reason of overdominance, overshadowing, visual intrusion, loss of light and loss of outlook. Therefore, the proposal would be contrary to policies DMHD 1 and DMHB 11 of the Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020)",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the 'Saved' UDP 2007, Local Plan Part 1, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service. No pre-application advice was sought. However the applicant would have been aware of the previous reasons for refusal."
