    "The development hereby permitted shall not be carried out except in complete accordance with the details shown on the submitted plans, numbers FSUTBE-ARUP-FSU-XX-DR-A-0006 Rev.

P01 and shall thereafter be retained/maintained for as long as the development remains in existence.",
    "REASON",
    "To ensure the development complies with the provisions of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 -  Development Management Polices (2020), Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 -  Site Allocations and Designations (2020) and The London Plan (2021).",
    "The decision to GRANT planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",

    "Cranes:",
    "Given the nature of the proposed development it is possible that a crane may be required during its construction. The applicant's attention is drawn to the requirement within the British Standard Code of Practice for the safe use of Cranes, for crane operators to consult the aerodrome before erecting a crane in close proximity to an aerodrome.
