  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed rear dormer, by reason of its siting in this visually prominent position and its size, scale, bulk and design would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the dwelling and would be detrimental to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policies DMHD 1 and DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service."
