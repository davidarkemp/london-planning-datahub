    "The roof alteration/extensions, by reason of the size, scale, bulk and design of the rear dormer window would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original detached dwelling, would be detrimental to the character, appearance of host dwelling and wider area of which it forms a part and to the visual amenities of the street scene of Park Avenue and St Edmunds Avenue and the surrounding area. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policy DMHD 1 and DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies with Modifications (March 2019), Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies BE13, BE15 and BE19 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Unitary Development Plan Saved Policies (November 2012) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document HDAS: Residential Extensions.",
