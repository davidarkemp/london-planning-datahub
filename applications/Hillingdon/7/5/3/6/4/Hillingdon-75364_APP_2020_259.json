    "The proposed development, by reason of its overall size, scale, bulk and height would be materially larger than the original building and therefore would significantly increase the built up appearance of the site. The proposal would therefore constitute inappropriate development in the Green Belt, contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework, Policy EM2 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policy DMEI 4 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020) and Policy 7.16 of the London Plan (July 2016).",
    "The proposed development by reason of its overall size, scale, bulk, width, height, design and total volume of the proposed extensions to the host dwelling, would constitute an overdevelopment of the plot, resulting in unsympathetic additions to the original dwelling which would subsume and engulf its character and fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original dwelling. The proposal would also be detrimental to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020)."
