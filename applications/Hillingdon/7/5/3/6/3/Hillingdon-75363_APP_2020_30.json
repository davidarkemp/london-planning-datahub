  "description": "Two storey side extensions and first floor rear extensions to both properties and conversion of existing 2 dwellings to 4 x 2-bed self-contained flats, involving alterations to rear elevation and demolition of existing single storey side elements",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The development would lead to the unacceptable subdivision and loss of two small single family dwellings for which there is an established need in the Borough. The development would therefore be contrary to policy DMH 4 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "The proposed extensions by reason of their cumulative size, scale, bulk, width, depth and design would result in an overly dominant and incongruous development that would fail to appear subordinate, would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original dwellings and would be detrimental to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area. Therefore the proposals would be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "The proposed two storey side extensions, by virtue of their siting, size, scale and design, including the lack of a set back from the front at all levels, would fail to appear as a subordinate additions and would thus be detrimental to the appearance of the original dwellings and the visual amenities of the street scene and the character and appearance of the wider area. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "The proposed development, by virtue of its failure to provide amenity space of sufficient size and quality commensurate to the size and layout of the said units would result in an over-development of the site and would be detrimental to the residential amenity of existing and future occupiers. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies DMHB 11 and DMHB 18 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "The communal use of the proposed amenity space would be detrimental to the residential amenity of the occupants of the proposed ground floor flats by reason of loss of privacy, overlooking and noise and disturbance. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policies DMHB 11 and DMHB 18 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan - The Spatial Development Strategy for London consolidated with alterations since 2011 (2016) and national guidance."
