    "The roof alterations/extensions and first floor rear extension to the dwelling, by reason of the size, scale, bulk, and design, would appear as an insubordinate, and visually incongruous form of development that would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original dwelling and would be detrimental to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area.  The proposal, therefore, conflicts, with Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local plan - Part Two (2020) and Policy D4 of the London plan (2021).",
    "The proposed first floor rear extension, by reason of its size, scale, bulk and proximity, would be detrimental to the amenities of the adjoining occupier at No.16 Saxony Parade, by reason of overshadowing, overbearing, loss of light, loss of outlook and creating a sense of enclosure. The proposal, therefore, conflicts, with Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "As a result of the development proposal, the residential dwelling would retain inadequate private amenity space provision, giving rise to a substandard form of living accommodation to the detriment of the amenities of future occupiers. The proposal, therefore, conflicts, with Policy DMHB 18 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020) and Policy D6 of The London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2021). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. The Council's supports pre-application discussions. We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
