  "description": "Change of use of 2 dwellings (Use Class C3) to a building for the provision of education (Use Class F1a)",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposal would result in the loss of the existing residential units, which are suitable with or without adaptation for residential use and would thus result in the diminution of the Council's existing housing stock to the detriment of the future housing needs of the borough. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy DMH 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and Policy H8 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "The proposed development by reason of its use as an independent school for the number of people proposed, would result in a significant increase in noise and general disturbance to nearby residential properties, and as such would constitute an un-neighbourly form of development, resulting in a material loss of residential amenity. Therefore, the proposal would be contrary to Policy D14 of the London Plan (2021), Policy EM8 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policy DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "The proposed development fails to provide sufficient on-plot parking resulting in substandard car parking provisions, leading to undue on-street parking demand to the detriment of on-street parking capacity and public/highway safety contrary to Policies DMT 1, DMT 2 and DMT 6 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020) and Policies T6 and T6.5 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "The proposal, by reason of its design and layout fails to provide a property which meets the requirements of people with disabilities and would therefore give rise to a substandard form of living accommodation to the detriment of the amenity of future occupiers. The proposal is thus contrary to Policies D5 and S3 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan - The Spatial Development Strategy for London consolidated with alterations since 2011 (2016) and national guidance.",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2016). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020."
