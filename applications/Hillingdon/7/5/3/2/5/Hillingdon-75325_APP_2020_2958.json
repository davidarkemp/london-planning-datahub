  "description": "Removal or variation of condition 2 (Approved Plans) of planning permission Ref: 75325/APP/2020/12 dated 06/03/2020 (Part two storey, part single storey side and rear extension and front extensions) to include a loft conversion with rear dormer",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposal includes the conversion of the roof space to habitable use to include a rear dormer, which did not form part of the original planning permission Ref: 75325/APP/2020/12. These amendments would result in an alteration to the description of the development originally approved and as such, the proposal cannot constitute a minor amendment under S73 of the Town and Country Planning Act. Therefore a full planning application is required for the proposed development.",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan - The Spatial Development Strategy for London consolidated with alterations since 2011 (2016) and national guidance.",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2016). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the proposal and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
