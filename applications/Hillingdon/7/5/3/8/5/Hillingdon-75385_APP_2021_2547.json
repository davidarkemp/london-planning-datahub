    "The Local Planning Authority considers that the applicant has failed to provide robust evidence to demonstrate that there are no other sequentially preferable alternative sites for the proposed development besides the application site which lies in Flood Zone 2. The proposal, therefore, does not pass the sequential test.  The proposal would fail to steer new development away from areas at the highest risk of flooding, contrary to Policy EM6 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies (2012), Policy DMEI 9 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy SI 12 of the London Plan (2021) and  paragraphs 159 and 162 of the NPPF (2021).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan - The Spatial Development Strategy for London consolidated with alterations since 2011 (2016) and national guidance.",
    "This is a reminder that Under the terms of the Planning Act 2008 (as amended) and Community Infrastructure Levy Regulations 2010 (as amended), should an application for appeal be allowed, the proposed development would be deemed as 'chargeable development' and therefore liable to pay the London Borough of Hillingdon Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and the Mayor of London's Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This would be calculated in accordance with the London Borough of Hillingdon CIL Charging Schedule 2014 and the Mayor of London's CIL Charging Schedule 2012.
