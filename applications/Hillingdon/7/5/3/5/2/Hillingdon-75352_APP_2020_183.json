  "description": "Two storey front extension, part two storey part single storey rear extension, conversion of roof space to habitable use to include 3 x side dormers and 3 x roof lights and conversion of garage to habitable use",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed additional dormers would disrupt the well-defined triangular built form of the roof and the two tiered nature of the dormers and scale would fail to remain subservient cluttering the roof slope. As such the proposal would fail to harmonise with the character, proportions and architectural composition of the original dwelling and would have a detrimental impact on the appearance, character and visual amenities of the street scene and the wider designated Conservation area which it would fail to preserve or enhance.  As such, the proposal would be contrary to Policies BE1 and HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 4 and DMHD 1 of the Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The  proposed two storey front extension would result in the property projecting further forward and closer to the main road and would dominate the dwelling. As such the proposal would fail to harmonise with the character, proportions and architectural composition of the original dwelling and would have a detrimental impact on the appearance, character and visual amenities of the street scene and the wider designated Conservation area which it would fail to preserve or enhance.  As such, the proposal would be contrary to Policies BE1 and HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 4 and DMHD 1 of the Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan - The Spatial Development Strategy for London consolidated with alterations since 2011 (2016) and national guidance.",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2016). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.  No pre-application advice was sought in this case.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
