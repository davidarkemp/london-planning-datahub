    "The proposed replacement dwelling, by reason of its overall design including the use of unsympathetic modern materials and poor fenestration (including excessive proliferation of rooflights) together with the overall scale, siting and poor overall design of the outbuilding, would result in an incongruous, dominant and visually intrusive form of development that would fail to preserve or enhance the appearance and character of the Northwood, Frithwood Conservation Area. The development would lead to less than substantial harm to the significance of the designated heritage asset and would harm the visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area. There are no public benefits that outweigh the harm identified. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies BE1 and HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012), Policies DMHB 1, DMHB 4, DMHB 11 and DMHD 2 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policies D3 and HC",
    "The development, by reason of the scale, siting and proximity of the outbuilding, and the positioning and proximity of the dormer window and rooflights in the south facing elevation, would respectively, result in visual intrusion and loss of outlook that would be harmful to the residential amenity of the neighbouring occupiers at No.29, and an unacceptable loss of privacy and overlooking that would be harmful to the residential amenity of the neighbouring occupiers at No.25. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 2 of Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy D3 of London Plan (2021) and Paragraph 135(f) of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2021). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal.",
    "This is a reminder that Under the terms of the Planning Act 2008 (as amended) and Community Infrastructure Levy Regulations 2010 (as amended), should an application for appeal be allowed, the proposed development would be deemed as 'chargeable development' and therefore liable to pay the London Borough of Hillingdon Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and the Mayor of London's Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This would be calculated in accordance with the London Borough of Hillingdon CIL Charging Schedule 2014 and the Mayor of London's CIL Charging Schedule 2012.
