    "The proposed development by reason of its siting, scale, design and cumulative visual impact in combination with the existing roof extensions and alterations would result in a top heavy, incongruous and visually harmful development which would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original dwelling, detrimental to the appearance of the dwelling, visual amenities of the street scene and character of the Northwood Hills Area of Special Local Character. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policies HE1 and BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 5, DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), Policies D3 and HC1 of the London Plan (2021), and Chapters 12 and 16 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
