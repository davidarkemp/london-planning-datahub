  "description": "Addition of a second floor and first floor rear extension to create 2 x 2 bed flats",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed second floor extension, by reason of its overall siting, size, scale, bulk and height would represent a visually intrusive and overdominant form of development which would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original property, would be detrimental to the character, appearance and symmetry of the terrace of properties of which it forms a part and to the visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "The proposed first floor rear extension, by virtue of its size, scale, bulk, depth and proximity, would be detrimental to the amenities of the adjoining occupier at 35A Coldharbour Lane, by reason of overdominance, overshadowing, visual intrusion, loss of light and loss of outlook. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies.",
    "The proposal would provide single bedrooms of an unsatisfactory size for the future occupiers of the proposed units and would therefore give rise to a substandard form of living accommodation to the detriment of the amenity of future occupiers. The proposal is thus contrary to Policy DMHB 16 of the adopted Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), Policy 3.5 and Table 3.3 of the London Plan (2016), the Housing Standards Minor Alterations to The London Plan (March 2016), the Mayor of London's adopted Supplementary Planning Guidance - Housing (March 2016) and the Technical Housing Standards - Nationally Described Space Standard (March 2015)."
