  "description": "Part two storey, part single storey rear extension and addition of window to front elevation.",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed part two storey/part single storey rear extension, by reason of its siting in this visually prominent position, size, scale, bulk and design, including the introduction of a dual pitched roof profile, would appear as an incongruous addition that would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original dwelling. The proposed external alterations, including the blocking up of the first floor terrace with a window, would harm the visual aesthetics of the building and the overall rhythm of the street frontage. The proposal would therefore be detrimental to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the host dwelling, the street scene and the surrounding area, contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "The proposed part two storey, part single storey rear extension, by virtue of its size, scale, bulk, height, depth and proximity, would be detrimental to the amenities of the adjoining occupier at 16 Churchill Road by reason of overdominance, overshadowing, visual intrusion, loss of light and loss of outlook. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "The proposed development, by virtue of its failure to maintain an adequate provision of private external amenity space, would have a harmful effect on the living conditions of the occupants of the host property at number 18 Churchill Road. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policies DMHB 18 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2016). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020."
