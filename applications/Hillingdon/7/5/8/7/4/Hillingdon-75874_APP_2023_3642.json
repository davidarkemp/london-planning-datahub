    "Nuisance from demolition and construction works is subject to control under The Control of Pollution Act 1974, the Clean Air Acts and other related legislation. In particular, you should ensure that the following are complied with:-",
    "A. Demolition and construction works which are audible at the site boundary shall only be carried out between the hours of 08.00 and 18.00 hours Monday to Friday and between the hours of 08.00 hours and 13.00 hours on Saturday.

    "The site lies in a Critical Drainage Area (CDA) as identified in the Surface Water Management Plan (SWMP) for Hillingdon. A CDA is the catchment area from which surface water drains and contributes to drainage problems. All developments in this area must contribute to managing the risk of flooding from surface water by reducing surface water runoff from the site. Therefore the applicant should minimise the water from your site entering the sewers. No drainage to support the extension should be connected to any existing surface water sewer, other than as an overflow. Water run off from any roof or hard paving associated with the development should be directed to a soakaway, or tank or made permeable. This includes any work to front gardens not part of the planning application, which must be permeable or be collected and directed to a permeable area, otherwise it would need an additional permission. A water butt should be incorporated.",
    "This permission as granted relates solely to the erection of the single storey rear extension and the double storey side extension. The demolition of the extant unlawful extension depicted on the existing plans are subject to a separate planning enforcement notice Ref: KC/ENF/020889 dated 4th October 2022. Failure to comply with an enforcement notice is an offence that may result in an unlimited fine (previously limited to Â£20,000) if convicted. Continued non-compliance can result in further prosecutions for further offences, incurring additional fines. An enforcement notice is also entered on the Local Land Charges records which could make the future sale or financing of the property more difficult.",
    "Notwithstanding the development hereby approved, the applicant is reminded that planning consent reference 75874/APP/2022/1746 cannot be constructed in addition to the two storey side extension in accordance with Policy DMHD 1 of the Local Plan : Part Two - Development Management Policies."
