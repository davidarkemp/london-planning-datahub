    "The proposed roof alterations/extensions, by reason of the bulky and poorly designed front dormer, unsympathetic hip to gable roof extension, inclusion of uncharacteristic design features (crittal windows, grey slate tiles, Juliet balcony) would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original dwelling and would form an unduly prominent addition to the street scene which would fail to integrate with the appearance of other properties in the area, subsequently causing harm to the character and appearance of the street scene.  The proposed development would also fail to preserve or enhance the character and appearance of the surrounding Ruislip Village Conservation Area.  The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policies BE1 and HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 1, DMHB 4, DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020),as well as Policy H",
