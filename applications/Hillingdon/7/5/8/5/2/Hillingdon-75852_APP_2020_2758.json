  "description": "Installation of vehicular crossover and hardstanding to front",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed crossover would lead to an off street car parking space of insufficient depth, resulting in vehicles overhanging onto the public footpath, causing an obstruction to pedestrians to the detriment of highway and pedestrian safety, contrary to policies DMHD 1, DMT 2 and DMT 6 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "The proposal by reason of the loss of the landscaping and boundary treatment to the frontage, which is a common and attractive feature on this part of Hilliard Road, would be detrimental to the visual amenity and character of the street scene and the wider Old Northwood Area of Special Local Character, in which it would be set, by creating an open parking area and emphasising the appearance of a hard surfaced area. The proposals is thus, contrary to Policies BE1 and HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 1, DMHB 5, DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), Policy 7.8 of the London Plan (2016) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2019).",
    "The excavation and construction work associated with the installation of the vehicular crossover will be within the root protection area of a highway tree. In the absence of a Tree Survey and Arboricultural Implication Assessment to BS5837:2012 standards, the application has failed to demonstrate that the development will safeguard this existing tree and further fails to demonstrate protection for and long-term retention of the tree. The proposal is therefore detrimental to the visual amenity of the street scene and the wider Old Northwood Area of Special Local Character. The proposals is thus, contrary to Policies BE1 and HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 1, DMHB 5, DMHB 11, DMHB 14 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), Policy 7.8 of the London Plan (2016) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2019).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2016). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 in  January 2020.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service. We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
