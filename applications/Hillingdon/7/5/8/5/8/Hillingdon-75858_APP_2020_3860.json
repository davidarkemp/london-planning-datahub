  "description": "Part two storey, part single storey side and rear extension and porch to front",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed part two storey, part single storey side and rear extension, by reason of its size, scale, bulk, width and design, including the introduction of a crown roof profile, would appear as an incongruous and disproportionate addition that would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original semi-detached dwelling, would be detrimental to the character, appearance and symmetry of the pair of semi-detached houses of which it forms a part and to the visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area. The proposal would therefore be contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "The proposed part two storey, part single storey side and rear extension, by virtue of its size, scale, bulk, depth and proximity, would be detrimental to the amenities of the adjoining occupier at 15 Beech Close by reason of overdominance,  visual intrusion and loss of outlook. The proposal would therefore be contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2016). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020."
