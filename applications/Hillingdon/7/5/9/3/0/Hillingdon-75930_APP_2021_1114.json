    "The proposed two storey side extension, by virtue of its siting, size, scale and design would fail to appear as a subordinate addition and would thus fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original detached dwelling. It would be detrimental to the character and appearance of the original detached dwelling and to the visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
