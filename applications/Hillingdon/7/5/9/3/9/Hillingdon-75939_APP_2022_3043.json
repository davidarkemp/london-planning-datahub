    "The proposal would provide a poor standard of living accommodation, with poor outlook and no defensible space for bedrooms 5 and 6, subsequently harming the amenities of future occupiers. The proposal would therefore be contrary to the requirements of Policies DMH 1, DMH 5, and DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), D6 of the London Plan (2021) and paragraph 130(f) of the NPPF (2021).",
    "The proposed development, given the number of potential occupants across 8no. separate bedrooms would give rise to undue noise and general disturbance to neighbouring residents, particularly as a result of a marked increase in comings and goings from the site, the use of the rear garden and the lack of information relating to sound insulation. The proposal would therefore be contrary to the requirements of Policies DMH 5 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The proposed development would fail to provide both electrical vehicle charging points and no clear practical cycle storage. The proposed development is therefore considered to be contrary to Policies DMT 2 and DMT 6 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), as well as policy T6 of the London Plan and paragraph 112 (c) and (e) of the NPPF (2021).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan - The Spatial Development Strategy for London consolidated with alterations since 2011 (2016) and national guidance."
