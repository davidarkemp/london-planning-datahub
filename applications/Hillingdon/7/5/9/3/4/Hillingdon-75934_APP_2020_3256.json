  "description": "Two storey side extension with alterations to fenestration",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed two storey side extension, by virtue of its siting, size, scale, bulk and width, including the absence of a set-back from the front wall of the host dwelling at all levels and absence of a set-down from the the main ridge line of the host dwelling, would fail to appear as a subordinate addition thus failing to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original dwelling, would be detrimental to the character and appearance of the row of terrace properties it forms a part of and to the visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area. The proposal would, therefore, be contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2016). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020."
