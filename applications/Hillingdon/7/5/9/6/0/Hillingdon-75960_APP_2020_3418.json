  "description": "Installation of vehicular crossover to front and associated works",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed development by reason of the loss of the soft landscaping and grass verge to the frontage which is a common and attractive feature on this part of Hatch Lane and the consequent excessive area of hardstanding, would be detrimental to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the street scene and would fail to either preserve or enhance the character or appearance of the surrounding Harmondsworth Village Conservation Area. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies BE1 and HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 1, DMHB 4, DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHB 14 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), Policy 7.8 of the London Plan (2016) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2019).",
    "The proposed development, by reason of the excessive width of the proposed crossover that would be required to access the proposed parking spaces, its siting in relation to the adjacent bus stop and with vehicles reversing on to Hatch Lane would result in the disruption of the free flow of traffic and obscured visibility to the detriment of highway and pedestrian safety contrary to Policies DMT 2 and DMT 6 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2016). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service."
