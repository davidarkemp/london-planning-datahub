    "The proposed outbuilding, by virtue of its excessive size, scale and bulk, would be wholly uncharacteristic of the area and would represent an intrusive addition to the site, which would visually compete with the host dwelling and be harmful to the established character and appearance of the local area in conflict with Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DHMB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 2 of the London Borough of Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The proposal is for a detached structure which, by reason of its size and scale, is considered capable of independent occupation from the main dwelling and is thus tantamount to a separate dwelling in a position where such a dwelling would not be acceptable as it could result in unacceptable impact on adjoining occupiers and additional requirements for parking and amenity space. The proposal is therefore contrary to policies DMHB 11, DMT 6, DMHB 18 and DMHD 2 of the London Borough of Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service."
