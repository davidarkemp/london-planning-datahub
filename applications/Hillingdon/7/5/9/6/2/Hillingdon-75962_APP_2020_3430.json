  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed side dormer windows and hip to gable conversions, by reason of their siting, size, scale, bulk, and design would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original dwelling and would be detrimental to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area. Therefore, the proposal would be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "The proposed single storey rear extension, by reason of its siting, size, scale, bulk, depth and design would fail to appear a subordinate addition to the main dwelling and would result in an un-neighbourly form of development to the detriment of the residential amenities of occupiers at No. 54 Chapel Lane. Therefore, the proposal would be contrary to Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020)."
