    "Due to its excessive height, bulk and poor design, the proposed building would form an oversized, uncharacteristic and visually incongruous form of development which would fail to harmonise with the established character of the area and appearance of the street scene. The proposal would therefore be detrimental to the visual amenities of the streetscene and the character and appearance of the surrounding area, all contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012), Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policies D1 and D3 of the London Plan (2021) and paragraphs 130 (a) and (c) of the NPPF (2021).",
    "Due to its excessive height, bulk, poor design and position within the setting of the locally listed building and Hayes Village Conservation Area, the proposed building would form an oversized and unduly prominent form of development which would fail to harmonise with the established character of the area, whilst also detracting from the setting of the locally listed building and lessening its contribution to the areas appearance.  The less than substantial harm caused to the setting of the heritage assets would not be outweighed by public benefits.  The proposal is therefore contrary to Section 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended),  paragraph 201, 203, 207 of the NPPF (2021), Policy HE1 and BE1 of the Local Plan Part 1 (2012), Policy DMHB 1, DMHB 3, DMHB 4 and DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan : Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and Policy HC1 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "No pedestrian footpath/cycle route will be provided for future residents leading from the building to Warley road. As such new residents would have to walk or ride through the busy commercial car park, to the main road. This could put them in danger from vehicles entering and existing the site, especially as the access route from Warley Road is narrow. It is therefore considered that proposed development would create a dangerous, unwelcoming and hazardous environment for future residents of the scheme. The proposal is therefore considered to be contrary to paragraph 130 (f) of the NPPF (2021), D3 and T4 of the London Plan, DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMT2 and of the of the Hillingdon Local Plan : Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020)",
    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate the proposal would provide adequate parking for both existing commercial occuipers nearby as well as future occuipers of the proposed development. No legal agreement is in place to resolve this issue by prohibiting future residents of the proposed development from parking in the retained parking spaces, noted as allocated for commercial business users within the area. In the absence of a satisfactory legal agreement, future residents could park in the spaces allocated for commercial use. This would lead to displacement of parking on to surroundings roads and areas, which would not be in the best interests of Highway safety. Consequently, the proposal would be contrary to Policy DMT 2 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020) and Policy T4 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan (2021) and national guidance.",
    "This is a reminder that Under the terms of the Planning Act 2008 (as amended) and Community Infrastructure Levy Regulations 2010 (as amended), should an application for appeal be allowed, the proposed development would be deemed as 'chargeable development' and therefore liable to pay the London Borough of Hillingdon Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and the Mayor of London's Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This would be calculated in accordance with the London Borough of Hillingdon CIL Charging Schedule 2014 and the Mayor of London's CIL Charging Schedule 2012.",
