  "description": "Two storey building with habitable roofspace to form 8 x 3-bed self contained flats involving demolition of existing residential units",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed development, by reason of its size, scale, bulk, massing, layout and design, would result in a poor, incongruous and overly dominant form of development that would be detrimental to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the street scene and the character and appearance of the Northwood Town Centre, Green Lane Conservation Area. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies BE1 and HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 1, DMHB 4, DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), Policy 7.8 of the London Plan (2016) and the NPPF.",
    "The proposal would result in the provision of habitable rooms (serving bedrooms on the ground floor) adjacent to the access for the rear car park resulting in general noise and disturbance as well as light pollution that would result in harm to the residential amenity of future occupants, contrary to Policies DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and Policies 3.5 and 5.3 of the London Plan (2016).",
    "The proposed development, by virtue of it's poor external layout (the accessibility and position of the communal garden) and the position and size of the balconies would fail to provide an adequate level of external amenity for future residents in accordance with the Council's standards to the detriment of the amenity of future occupants. The development is therefore contrary to Policies DMHB 11 and DMHB 18 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and Policies 3.5 and 5.3 of the London Plan (2016).",
    "In the absence of a Tree Survey and Arboricultural Impact Assessment to BS5837:2012 standards, the application has failed to demonstrate that the development will safeguard existing trees on the site and further fails to demonstrate protection for and long-term retention of the trees. The proposal is therefore detrimental to the visual amenity of the Northwood Town Centre, Green Lane Conservation Area contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) Policy DMHB 14, DMHB 4, DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies.",
    "The development would provide off-street parking that would exceed the Council's maximum parking standards. As such the development fails to promote the use of sustainable transport methods contrary to policy DMT 6 of the Council's adopted Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies.",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan - The Spatial Development Strategy for London consolidated with alterations since 2011 (2016) and national guidance."
