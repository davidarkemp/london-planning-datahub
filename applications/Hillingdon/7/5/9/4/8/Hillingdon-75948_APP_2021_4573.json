  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed development, by reason of merging two individual plots and creating an extensive built form, together with excessive size, scale, massing, height, width, external finishes and design (including proposed balconies and numerous dormers) of the proposed building would fail to harmonise with the character and architectural composition of the surrounding properties, appearing as a visually dominant, incongruous and bulky form of development which would be detrimental to the visual amenity of the street scene and harmful to the character and appearance of the surrounding Northwood Town Centre, Green Lane Conservation Area, and the setting of the grade II Listed Building at Northwood Police Station. The proposal therefore conflicts with Policies BE1 and HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One- Strategic Policies (2012) and Policies DMHB 1, DMHB 2, DMHB 4, DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020), Policies HC1, D3 and D4",
    "The proposed development, by virtue of the introduction of the proposed rear balconies and the close proximity of the private driveway, would cause unreasonable harm to the living conditions of the neighbouring residential occupiers at Tudor Lodge and Copper Beach Court, in terms of loss of privacy, overlooking, noise disturbance and light pollution. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policy DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The proposed development, by virtue of position of the windows/dormer windows serving habitable rooms within the proposed flats (labelled as Units 2, 4, 5 and 7) in relation to the proposed driveway and the site's side (northern) boundary, would give rise to substandard forms of residential accommodation, in terms of poor outlook, noise, disturbance and light pollution. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies DMHB 15 and DMHB 16 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021)",
    "In the absence of a BRE daylight and sunlight assessment, the application has failed to demonstrate that the proposed development would afford its future occupiers with a satisfactory level of daylight and sunlight. The proposal would therefore fail to provide adequate internal living environment for future occupiers, contrary to Policy DMHB 16 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021)",
    "The proposed development, by virtue of the inadequate depth of the proposed balconies undermining its functionality and useability, would result in substandard forms of external amenity space provision for future occupiers at the site. The proposal therefore conflicts with Policy",
    "DMHB 18 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "In the absence of an Arboricultural Impact Assessment, Method Statement and Tree Protection Plan, the application has failed to demonstrate that the proposed development could be constructed without undue harm to the trees protected by Tree Preservation Order number 483 and the Conservation Area designation of the site. The potential harm caused to protected trees would undermine the  verdant character and visual amenity of the street scene and surrounding Northwood Town Centre, Green Lane Conservation Area. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One Strategic Policies (2012),  Policies DMHB 11 and DMHB 14 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2: Development Management Policies (2020), Policy G7 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The overprovision of on-site parking spaces in a connected location with a moderate level of public transport accessibility (rating 3) would discourage the use of more sustainable modes of transport, to the detriment of opportunities to create mixed and vibrant places that are designed for people rather than vehicles. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policy DMT 1 and DMT 6 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020), Policies T4, T6 and T6.1 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "a) We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal.",
    "This is a reminder that Under the terms of the Planning Act 2008 (as amended) and Community Infrastructure Levy Regulations 2010 (as amended), should an application for appeal be allowed, the proposed development would be deemed as 'chargeable development' and therefore liable to pay the London Borough of Hillingdon Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and the Mayor of London's Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This would be calculated in accordance with the London Borough of Hillingdon CIL Charging Schedule 2014 and the Mayor of London's CIL Charging Schedule 2012.",
    "For more information on CIL matters please visit the planning portal page at: www.planningportal.gov.uk/planning/applications/howtoapply/whattosubmit/cil",
    "The decision to GRANT planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to GRANT planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan - The Spatial Development Strategy for London consolidated with alterations since 2011 (2016) and national guidance."
