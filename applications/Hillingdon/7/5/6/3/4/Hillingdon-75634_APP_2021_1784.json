    "The development would result in the unacceptable loss of private amenity space reducing it to a level below the Council's standards. As such the development would result in the provision of substandard residential accommodation failing to provide an adequate level of amenity for existing and future occupants. The development would therefore be contrary to policies DMHB 11, DMHB 18 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020) and Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan - The Spatial Development Strategy for London consolidated with alterations since 2011 (2016) and national guidance."
