    "The proposal by reason of its siting in this open prominent position, size, scale, bulk and siting forward of the return building line would result in the loss of an important gap characteristic to the area, resulting in a cramped appearance. The proposal would therefore represent an overdevelopment of the site to the detriment of the character, appearance and visual amenities of the area and to this existing open area of the street scene. Therefore the proposal is contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), Policies D4 and D8 of the London Plan (2021) and the NPPF (2021).",
    "The new home, due to the proximity of main rear windows to the adjacent property at 3 Adelphi Crescent, would result in a poor standard of light and outlook to habitable spaces in the proposed dwelling in conflict with the requirements of Policy DMHB11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan - Part Two (2020) and Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "The proposal fails to provide amenity space of sufficient size and quality commensurate to the size and layout of the said units. The proximity of the space to the street and the near neighbour at No.3 would also enclose and compromise the quality of this space. As such the proposal would provide a substandard form of accommodation for future residents contrary to Policies DHB11 and DMHB18 of the Hillingdon Local Plan - Part Two (2020).",
    "The proposed dwelling, by reason of its size and design would be inaccessible to wheelchair users contrary to Policy D7 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "The proposed development fails to provide sufficient and safe off street parking provision which meets the councils approved parking standards to service the proposed and existing dwellings.  The development also proposes an overprovision of parking, but designed in a way which would lead to additional on-street parking. The layout as a whole would be detrimental of public and highway safety and is therefore contrary to Policies T4 of T6 of the London plan (2021).",
    "This is a reminder that Under the terms of the Planning Act 2008 (as amended) and Community Infrastructure Levy Regulations 2010 (as amended), should an application for appeal be allowed, the proposed development would be deemed as 'chargeable development' and therefore liable to pay the London Borough of Hillingdon Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and the Mayor of London's Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This would be calculated in accordance with the London Borough of Hillingdon CIL Charging Schedule 2014 and the Mayor of London's CIL Charging Schedule 2012.",

    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the 'Saved' UDP 2007, Local Plan Part 1, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service. This is a resubmission of a previously refused scheme, where the Inspectors Report identified issues to be addressed, which were reflected in the reasons for refusal, allowing the opportunity to address those issues within this submission."
