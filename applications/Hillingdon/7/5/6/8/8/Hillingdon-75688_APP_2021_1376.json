    "The proposed development, by reason of the size, design and siting of the proposed monopole and the quantity, size, scale and siting of the equipment cabinets would create an obtrusive form of development which would add visual clutter to the detriment of the character, appearance and visual amenities of the street scene, to the setting of the adjoining Grade II Listed Buildings, namely the Pump, Long Lane, the Coach and Horses Public House, Long Lane and St Giles Church, High Road, and would fail to either preserve or enhance the character or appearance of the surrounding Ickenham Village Conservation Area. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies BE1 and HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 1, DMHB 2, DMHB 4, DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHB 21 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy HC1 of the London Plan (2021) and the NPPF.",
    "In the absence of an appropriate appraisal of the historical importance of the area, the submission fails to adequately assess whether there are other more appropriate sites available for the development, in accordance with Paragraph 115 of the NPPF (February 2019) and Policy DMHB 21 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The applicant has failed to notify the Civil Aviation Authority, the Secretary of State for Defence or the aerodrome operator of the proposal prior to the submission of this application as specified in Schedule 2, Part 16 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended), as the site is located within 3km of a aerodrome.",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan - The Spatial Development Strategy for London consolidated with alterations since 2011 (2016) and national guidance.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
