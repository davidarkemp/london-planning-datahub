  "description": "Two storey side extension. part two storey, part single storey rear extension and conversion of roof space to habitable use to include 7 rooflights and rendered finish",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed extensions by reason of their cumulative size, scale, bulk and design, particularly to the side and to the roof, would represent a visually unsympathetic form of development that would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original dwelling and the terrace of which it forms a part, and would be detrimental to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the street scene. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 11 DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service."
