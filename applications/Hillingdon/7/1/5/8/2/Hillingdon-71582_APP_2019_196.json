    "The proposed telecommunications lattice tower, by virtue of its 30m height and position in close proximity to the Grand Union Canal and the towpath, would appear as an overbearing and visually intrusive addition to the area, resulting in a detrimental impact on the character and appearance of the surrounding area and canal corridor, contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 21 and DMEI 8 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020) and Chapter 10 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2018).",
    "The proposed telecommunications lattice tower, by virtue of its 30m height and location, would disrupt the outlook of future residents of Blocks A and B, particularly in relation to views towards the Grand Union Canal, thereby impacting on the amenity of the approved residential-led development, contrary to Policy DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "The proposed development, by virtue of its siting, results in the loss of two parking spaces for the approved development being implemented on site under Council Ref: 71582/APP/2016/4582, and therefore the development is considered to result in substandard car parking provision, leading to on-street parking/queuing to the detriment of public and highway safety, contrary to Policy DMT 6 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "The proposal fails to demonstrate that alternative sites for the permanent replacement telecommunications installation have been properly explored, contrary to Policy DMHB 21 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020) and Chapter 10 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2018).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Unitary Development Plan Saved Policies (September 2007) as incorporated into the Hillingdon Local Plan (2012) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan - The Spatial Development Strategy for London consolidated with alterations since 2011 (2016) and national guidance.",
    "The applicant is advised that whilst an alternative plan with a roof-top telecommunication installation has been provided, this does not form part of this application and would need to be assessed on its own merits as part of a separate planning application."
