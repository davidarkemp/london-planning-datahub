    "The proposed first floor side extension, in conjunction with existing extensions, by reason of its size, scale, bulk and cumulative width, would result in an incongruous form of development that would not appear as a subordinate addition to the original dwellinghouse and would be detrimental to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the surrounding area.  The proposed development would also be detriimental to the symmetry of the pair of semi-detached houses of which the application site forms a part.  The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHD 1, DMHB 1, DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2021). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020."
