    "Condition 14 of Planning Application No. 3408/APP/2000/703 states 'Notwithstanding the provisions of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 1995, no extensions or changes to the external appearance of any dwellinghouse (including alterations to fenestration) shall be carried out, nor shall any sheds, garages, porches, fences, gates or walls be erected and balconies formed without the prior written consent of the Local Planning Authority'. Taking into consideration the condition, No.13 Barwick Drive does not have permitted development rights for extensions. As such the proposed development cannot be granted as permitted development under the provisions of Article 3, Schedule 2, Part 1, Class B and C of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "In the absence of the property having permitted development rights, Planning permission is required for the proposed works."
