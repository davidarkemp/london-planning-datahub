    "The proposed development, by reason of its siting and layout would result in a development of the site, which would fail to harmonise with the existing local and historic context of the surrounding area. The principle of intensifying the residential use of the site as proposed, as well as the proposed loss of existing private rear garden area would have a detrimental impact on the visual amenity, character and appearance of the street scene and of the area as a whole. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policy DMH 6 and DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), Policies D1, D3 and D6 of the London Plan (2021), guidance within The London Plan Housing Supplementary Planning Guidance (March 2016) and the NPPF (2021).",
    "The proposed development, by reason of its siting, size, scale, bulk, design and proximity, would be detrimental to the amenities of the adjoining occupier at 15 Ash Grove  by reason of overdominance, visual intrusion, and loss of privacy. Therefore, the proposal would be contrary to Policy DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The proposal has not demonstrated a satisfactory policy-led approach to the provision of car parking or that sufficient off street parking arrangements would be provided for both the existing and new dwellings, and therefore the development is considered to result in substandard car parking provision, leading to on-street parking to the detriment of public and highway safety, contrary to Policies DMT 2 and DMT 6 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020) and to Hillingdon's Adopted Parking Standards as set out in Appendix C of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "The proposed development, by reason of its design and layout fails to meet the requirements of people with disabilities and would therefore give rise to a substandard form of living accommodation to the detriment of the amenity of future occupiers. The proposal is thus contrary to Policy DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and Policies D5 and D7 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan - The Spatial Development Strategy for London consolidated with alterations since 2011 (2016) and national guidance.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
