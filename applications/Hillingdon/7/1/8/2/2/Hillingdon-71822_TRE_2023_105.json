    "Both Sycamore's are situated within the car park of The Poplars. One (T67) is highly visible from High Street Harefield and the other (T64) is more prominent from Breakspear Road North. Both Sycamores significantly contribute to the arboreal character of the Harefield Village Conservation Area and have high amenity values.",
    "The applicant has ticked yes to Alleged damage to property and has provided a report from a drainage company. However, the drainage companies report is in relation to roots blocking a drain to the front of the property not near either of the Sycamores, it also does not recommend tree removal instead recommending lining of the drainage to stop the roots.",
    "It is noted that the application is also to lift 2 conifers over the highway by 5m, these are protected by virtue of their location within the conservation area however work to lift branches over the highway is exempt, see informative.",

    "The removal of deadwood, dangerous / hanging branches and ivy:  This does not require the formal consent of the Council.",
