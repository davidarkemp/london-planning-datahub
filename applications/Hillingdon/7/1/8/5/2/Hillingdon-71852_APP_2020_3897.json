  "description": "Variation of condition No. 3 (Materials) of planning permission ref: 71852/APP/2018/3249 dated 12/03/2019 to alter the proposed external materials (Single storey side/front/rear extension, conversion of attached garage to habitable use, and extension and conversion of roof space to habitable use to include 10 side roof lights and gable end window to the rear).",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed external materials, by virtue of the introduction of limestone white render, anthracite grey style window frames, and grey concrete tiles, would be detrimental to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the street scene and would fail to either preserve or enhance the character or appearance of the  Hillside, Northwood, Hills Area of Special Local Character. The proposal therefore fails to comply with Policies BE1 and HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 1, DMHB 5, DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), Policy 7.8 of the London Plan (2016) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2019).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2016). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020."
