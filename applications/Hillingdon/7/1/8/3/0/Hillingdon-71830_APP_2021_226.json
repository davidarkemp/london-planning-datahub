  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed development by reason of its position, siting and proximity to the neighbouring properties at 56b, 50, 52 and the amenity space of 48 High Street, would result in an unacceptable level of mutual overlooking, loss of privacy and visual intrusion. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local plan Part One and Policy DMHB 11 of the Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The proposal, as indicated, would provide an indoor living area of an unsatisfactory size and quality for the future occupiers of the one bedroom flats, with very poor levels of light and outlook to proposed habitable rooms and would therefore give rise to a substandard form of living accommodation to the detriment of the amenity of future occupiers. The proposal is thus contrary to Policy DMHB 16 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy D6 and Table 3.1 of the London Plan (2021), the Mayor of London's adopted Supplementary Planning Guidance - Housing (March 2016) and the Technical Housing Standards - Nationally Described Space Standard (March 2015).",
    "The proposed development, by virtue of its site coverage would fail to provide amenity space of sufficient size and quality commensurate to the size and layout of the proposed units and would thus result in an over-development of the site detrimental to the residential amenity of existing and future occupiers. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy DMHB 18 of the Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service."
