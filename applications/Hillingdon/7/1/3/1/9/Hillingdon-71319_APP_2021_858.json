    "The proposed plans indicate amendments which would result in a breach of condition 5 of the original planning consent which states that any side windows must be obscure glazed and non-openable. As such the changes cannot be considered as non-material as they represent a form of development beyond the scope of the planning approval. The potential impacts therefore need to be considered as part of a new planning application."
