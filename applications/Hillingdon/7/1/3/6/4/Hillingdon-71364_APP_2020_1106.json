    "The proposed first floor side extension by reason of its size, scale, bulk and design, including an uncharacteristic crown/flat roof, would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original dwelling and would be detrimental to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "The proposed detached garage/outbuilding, by reason of its siting, size, scale, bulk, height and gable roof design would be detrimental to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12, DMHD 1 and DMHD 2 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "The proposal is for a detached structure which, by reason of its size, scale, height and independent access, is considered capable of independent occupation from the main dwelling and is thus tantamount to a separate dwelling in a position where such a dwelling would not be acceptable as it could result in unacceptable impact on adjoining occupiers and additional requirements for parking and amenity space. The proposal is therefore contrary to policies DMHB 11, DMHD2, DMHB 18 and DMT6 of the London Borough of Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two-Development Management Policies and Policy 3.5 of the London Plan.",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2016). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service. We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
