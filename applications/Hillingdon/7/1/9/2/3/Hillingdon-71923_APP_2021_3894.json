    "The proposed residential units fail to comply with the nationally described space standards issued by the Department for Communities and Local Government on 27th March 2015 (as amended) in terms of satisfying minimum floor space and bedroom size standards and the units would therefore not provide an acceptable standard of residential accommodation, in accordance with Policy D6 of the London Plan (March 2021) and Policy DMHB 16 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (January 2020) and the proposal therefore fails to comply with Paragraph 3(9A) of Schedule 2 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "The building appears to be in use from photographic evidence gathered from a site visit undertaken on 28th January 2022 and Valuation Office records which suggest that the building has been in continuous office use since 1st April 2017. The submitted application form in Section 4a. (Eligibility - The current building and site), by having both 'Yes' and 'No' boxes ticked, also does not specify that the building has been vacant prior to the submission of the application. Therefore, the application fails to demonstrate that the building has been vacant for a continuous period of at least 3 months immediately prior to the date of the application for prior approval being submitted in order to comply with provision MA.1.(1)(a) of Class MA, Part 3, Schedule 2 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended)."
