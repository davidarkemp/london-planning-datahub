  "description": "Two storey rear extension",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed two storey rear extension, by virtue of its size, scale, bulk, height and proximity, would be detrimental to the amenities of the adjoining occupier at 88 Lansbury Drive by reason of overdominance, overshadowing, visual intrusion, loss of light and loss of outlook. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the 'Saved' UDP 2007, Local Plan Part 1, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service. This is a resubmission of a previously refused scheme, where the Officers Report identified issues to be addressed, which were reflected in the reasons for refusal, allowing the opportunity to address those issues within this submission."
