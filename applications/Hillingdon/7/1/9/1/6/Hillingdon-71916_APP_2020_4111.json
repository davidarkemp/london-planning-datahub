  "description": "Two storey side extension with pitched roof",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed two storey side extension, by reason of its size, scale, bulk and design would represent a discordant and incongruous addition which would fail to appear on keeping with the character and proportions of the original dwellinghouse and would be detrimental to the visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area.  The proposal would also fail to appear as a subordinate addition when viewed from Park Lane.  Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11, DMHD 1 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2016). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020."
