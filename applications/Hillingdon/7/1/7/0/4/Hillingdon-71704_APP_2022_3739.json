    "By virtue of departures to the predominant front and rear building line, the projecting gables to the proposed dwelling would result in a development that does not harmonise with the built form and significantly detracts from the character of the area, contrary to Paragraph 130 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021 and Policies BE1, DMH 6 and DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan 2020, and Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "The proposed development would likely result in an unacceptable loss of sunlight and daylight to the rear elevation of 28 Ash Grove, contrary to Policies BE1, DMHD 1 and DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan 2020.",
    "Due to substandard internal amenity space for a five person occupancy dwelling, poor outlook, light and ventilation for the second floor bedroom and inadequate outdoor amenity space in the rear garden, the proposal will cumulatively not afford an adequate level of amenity for future occupiers, contrary to Policies DMHB11, DMHB16 and DMHB 18 of the Hillingdon Local Plan 2020 and Policy D6 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "By virtue of not providing step free access to the ground floor nor any WC within the ground floor and in the absence of plans showing adequate circulation space within the bedrooms, the Council cannot be satisfied that the proposal will provide for accessible living in accordance with Policy D7 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan - The Spatial Development Strategy for London consolidated with alterations since 2011 (2016) and national guidance.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service. However, the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
