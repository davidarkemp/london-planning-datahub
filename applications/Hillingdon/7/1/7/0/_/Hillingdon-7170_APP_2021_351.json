  "description": "Single storey rear extension (retrospective)",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The rearward projection of the existing extension by reason of its cumulative size and scale would be over 10m deep, such that it would not be subordinate to the host property and would fail to harmonise with the adjacent properties and the existing character and appearance of the local area. The development proposed is considered to be overly dominant and out of character within the local area, likely to significantly harm the character and appearance of the area. The development proposed, therefore, is considered to be contrary to Policy BE 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012) and Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The existing rear extension, by virtue of its size, scale, bulk, depth and proximity would be detrimental to the amenities of the adjoining occupier at 121 Sweetcroft Lane by reason of over-dominance, overshadowing, visual intrusion, loss of light and loss of outlook. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "In the absence of a Flood Risk Assessment in accordance with the requirements of the National Planning Policy Framework and National Planning Practice Guidance, the application has failed to address issues relating to flood risk and the proposal is therefore contrary to Policy EM6 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policy DMEI 9 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies, Policy SI 12 of the London Plan (2021) and the NPPF (2019)."
