    "The proposed development, by reason of its overall size, bulk and scale would be materially larger than the existing building and therefore would significantly increase the built up appearance of the site. The proposal would therefore constitute inappropriate development in the Green Belt, contrary to Policy EM2 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), policies OL4, BE13, BE15 and BE19 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Saved UDP Policies (November 2012), Policy 7.16 of the London Plan (July 2016), the Council's adopted Supplementary Planning Document HDAS: Residential Extensions and the NPPF.",
    "The proposed single storey side/rear extension, by virtue of its size, scale and depth would be detrimental to the amenities of the adjoining occupiers at 18 Heatherfold Way, by reason of overdominance, overshadowing, visual intrusion, loss of light and loss of outlook. Therefore, the proposal would be contrary to policies BE19, BE20 and BE21 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Saved UDP Policies (November 2012) and the Council's adopted Supplementary Planning Document HDAS: Residential Extensions.",
    "The proposed extension would, by virtue of its failure to maintain an adequate amount of private usable external amenity space for the occupiers of the property, result in an over-development of the site detrimental to the residential amenity of existing and future occupiers. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies BE19 and BE23 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Unitary Development Plan Saved Policies (November 2012) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document HDAS: Residential Extensions.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. The Council's supports pre-application discussions however we have been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
