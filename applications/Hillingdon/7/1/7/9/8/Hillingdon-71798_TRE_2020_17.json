The trees appear to be in good health and pruning them would unnecessarily introduce multiple wounds into their crowns, which would likely cause stress and lead to infection, affecting their long-term health; this would affect the safe useful life expectancy of the trees. Pruning would also result in weakly attached re-growth forming that would be prone to future failure.",
