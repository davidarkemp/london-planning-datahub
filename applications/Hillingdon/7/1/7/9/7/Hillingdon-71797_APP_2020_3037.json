  "description": "Variation of condition 1 (Mooring Occupiers) of planning permission 71797/APP/2016/1419 and Appeal Decision APP/R5510/W/17/3183686 dated 28/09/2018 to allow for changes to the time period of the mooring occupiers (change of use to 2 residential moorings)",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "Condition 1 attached to Appeal Decision  APP/R5510/W/17/3183686 (Local Planning Authority reference 71797/APP/2016/1419) limits the permission to a temporary period. By contrast, the Section 73 application is effectively seeking planning permission for permanent moorings to be carried out by Mr Lewin and Mr Hibbett through the proposed variation of Condition 1. Consequently, the proposal being considered under the Section 73 application is fundamentally different to the \"temporary nature\" of the development originally approved at Appeal. This would result in a substantial change to the nature of the original temporary permission. As a result, the proposal goes beyond the parameters of a 'minor material amendment' in Section 73 of the Town and Country Planning Act, and is contrary to the guidance within the National Planning Practice Guidance, specifically Paragraph: 001 Reference ID: 17a-001-20140306.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service. We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reason for refusal.",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan - The Spatial Development Strategy for London consolidated with alterations since 2011 (2016) and national guidance."
