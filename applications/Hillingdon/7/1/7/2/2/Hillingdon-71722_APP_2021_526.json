  "description": "Conversion of roofspace to habitable use to include a rear dormer and conversion of roof from hip to gable end",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The roof alteration/extensions, by reason of the rear dormer window and hip to gable end roof design would fail to preserve or enhance the character and appearance of the Ruislip Village Conservation Area, fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original semi-detached dwelling, would be detrimental to the character and appearance of host dwelling, the symmetry of the pair of semi-detached houses and the wider area. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policy DMHD 1, DMHB 4 and DMHB 11 of the Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020)",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the 'Saved' UDP 2007, Local Plan Part 1, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service."
