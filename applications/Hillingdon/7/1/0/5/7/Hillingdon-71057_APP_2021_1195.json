    "The proposed part two storey, part single storey rear extension, by virtue of its crown roofed design and excessive eaves height fails to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original semi-detached dwellings, and is detrimental to the character, appearance and symmetry of the pair of semi-detached houses of which it forms a part and to the visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area. Therefore the proposal is contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012, Policies DMHD1, DMHB11 and DMHB12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan - Part Two (2020) and Policies D4 and D8 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "The proposed part two storey, part single storey rear extension at No.2, by reason of its size, design and proximity results in an overly dominant extension that overshadows the adjoining property at No.1 Maygoods View, and as such results in a visually intrusive and an un-neighbourly form of development, resulting in a loss of light, harmful sense of enclosure and material loss of outlook. Therefore the proposal is contrary to Policies DMHD1 and DMHB11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan - Part Two (2020)",
    "In the absence of a set of full, detailed plans and elevations, most notably floor plans, and accurate elevation plans, the quality of the proposed accommodation and the impact on the character, appearance and living conditions cannot be fully assessed and demonstrated to comply with Policies  DMHD1; DMHB11 and DMHB12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan - Part Two (2020) and Policies D4 and D8 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "Whilst unable to form a separate reason for refusal, the Local Planning Authority are not satisfied that appropriate the notice was served on No.1 Maygoods View on this application and the previous approval.",
    "The NPPG is clear that Certificate B should be signed for \"Shared Ownership\". This should be completed if the applicant is not the sole owner, or if there are agricultural tenants, and the applicant knows the names and addresses of all the other owners and/or agricultural tenants."
