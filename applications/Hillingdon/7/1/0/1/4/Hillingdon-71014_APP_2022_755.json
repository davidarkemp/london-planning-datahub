    "Due its irregular siting, design, size, layout and access, the proposed dwelling would form an uncharacteristic and incongruous addition to the area, which would fail to integrate the with the smaller scale of other garden development in the area. Due to the mentioned features, as well as the substandard car parking layout and retained gardens for existing and future occupiers, the proposal is considered to be an overdevelopment of the site. The proposal is therefore detrimental to the visual amenity and character of the surrounding area and is considered to be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies, Policies DMH 6, DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHB 18 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policies D1, D3 and D6 of the London Plan (2021), as well as paragraphs 71, 124 and 130 of the NPPF (2021).",
    "Due to its size, bulk, height and close proximity to neighbouring properties, the proposed dwelling would be detrimental to the amenities of the adjoining occupiers at Nos.2 and 2a Elm Close, by reason of noise, disturbance, visual intrusion and loss of outlook. Furthermore due to its tight and unusual access arrangement, the proposal would endanger residents of No.2a Elm Close as cars for the new dwelling would need to drive past the entrance of No.2a to reach the new dwelling.  It is therefore considered that the proposal would be contrary to Policy DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies.",
    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate that the proposed dwelling is accessible via foot and car without blocking or impeding the parking spaces of No.2a Elm Close. Blocking or impeding of the car parking spaces would result in cars being displaced onto the Local Highway Network. Roadside parking would create a more hazardous environment for road users, whilst also causing traffic build up and congestion as vehicles stop to pass parked vehicles. The proposal is therefore considered to result in a more dangerous and hazardous environment for pedestrians, users of the site and neighbouring sites and to cause harm to the free flow of traffic on the local highways network. The  development is therefore considered to be contrary to Policies DMT 2 and DMT 6 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), as well as policy T4 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "The proposed development would result in substandard private amenity space provision for the flats at No.2 and the property at 2a Elm Close. The occupiers of those dwellings would therefore have poor quality and insufficiently sized external amenity space, to the detriment of their amenities and living conditions. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policy DMHB 18 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan and national guidance.",
    "This is a reminder that Under the terms of the Planning Act 2008 (as amended) and Community Infrastructure Levy Regulations 2010 (as amended), should an application for appeal be allowed, the proposed development would be deemed as 'chargeable development' and therefore liable to pay the London Borough of Hillingdon Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and the Mayor of London's Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This would be calculated in accordance with the London Borough of Hillingdon CIL Charging Schedule 2014 and the Mayor of London's CIL Charging Schedule 2012.",
