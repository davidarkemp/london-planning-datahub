  "site_name": "63 HIGH STREET",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed signs by virtue of siting, size, materiality, design and illumination would be detrimental to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the street scene and would fail to either preserve or enhance the character or appearance of the surrounding Old Uxbridge/Windsor Street Conservation Area resulting in less than substantial harm to the significance of the designated heritage asset that would fail to be outweighed by the public benefits of the development. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies BE1 and HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 1, DMHB 4 and DMHB 13A of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), Policy HC1 of the London Plan (2021) and the NPPF (2024).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the 'Saved' UDP 2007, Local Plan Part 1, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service. This is a resubmission of a previously refused scheme, where the Officers Report identified issues to be addressed, which were reflected in the reasons for refusal, allowing the opportunity to address those issues within this submission."
