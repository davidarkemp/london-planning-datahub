    "The proposed development by reason of its design, siting, bulk and massing would result in a discordant and unsympathetic addition to the dwelling which would fail to read as subordinate and respect the architectural integrity of the host dwelling and result in harm to the character and appearance of the streetscene, and wider Area of Special Local Character. The proposal is therefore considered contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB11, DMHB12 and DMHD1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan - Part Two (2020) and Policies D4 and D6 of the London Plan (2021)."
