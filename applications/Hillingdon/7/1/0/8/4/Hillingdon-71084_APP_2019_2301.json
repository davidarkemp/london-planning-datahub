    "The proposed development, by reason of its siting in a rear garden, would fail to harmonise with the existing local and historic context of the surrounding area. The principle of intensifying the residential use involving the loss of existing private rear garden area is unacceptable in principle and contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policy H12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Saved UDP Policies (November 2012), Policy DMH 6 of the emerging Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies with Modifications (March 2019), Policy 3.5 of the London Plan (March 2016), guidance within The London Plan Housing Supplementary Planning Guidance (March 2016) and the National Planning Policy Framework (February 2019).",
    "The proposed dwelling, by reason of its location, design, layout and loss of the existing open garden aspect of the site, would have an unacceptable impact on the character, appearance and setting of the Grade II Listed Little Manor House, contrary to Policies BE1 and HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies BE8, BE9, BE10 and BE13 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Saved UDP Policies (November 2012), Policy DMHB 1, DMHB 2 and DMHB 11 of the emerging Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies with Modifications (March 2019), Policy 7.8 of the London Plan (2016), the adopted Supplementary Planning Document HDAS: Residential Layouts and the NPPF (February 2019).",
    "In the absence of a tree report to BS5837:2012, the applicant has failed to demonstrate that the trees will be unaffected by the development and has not made provision for their long term protection. As such, the proposal would be to the detriment of the visual amenities of the street scene and the character and appearance of the surrounding area and contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies BE19 and BE38 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Saved UDP Policies (November 2012), Policy DMHB 11 of the emerging Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies with Modifications (March 2019), Policies 3.5 and 5.10 of the London Plan (March 2016) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document HDAS: Residential Layouts.",
    "The proposed development, by virtue of the close proximity of the proposed driveway to the existing properties at, Little Manor House and 8 Arlington Drive, would be detrimental to the residential amenity of the occupants of  these properties, by reason of the noise and disturbance resulting from the use of this driveway and its visual impact. As such the proposal would fail to comply with Policies H12, BE13, BE19, BE21 and OE1 of the of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Saved UDP Policies (November 2012), Policy DMH 6 of the emerging Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies with Modifications (March 2019)Policy and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document HDAS: Residential Layouts.",
    "The proposal would be backland garden development which would fail to establish an active frontage with natural surveillance. By virtue of a 50 metre long access road, the entrance to the property would not be visible from the street scene. As such, the proposal is considered contrary to Policy DMHB 15 of the emerging Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies with Modifications (March 2019) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document HDAS: Residential Layouts.",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Unitary Development Plan Saved Policies (September 2007) as incorporated into the Hillingdon Local Plan (2012) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan - The Spatial Development Strategy for London consolidated with alterations since 2011 (2016) and national guidance.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the 'Saved' UDP 2007, Local Plan Part 1, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service. We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
