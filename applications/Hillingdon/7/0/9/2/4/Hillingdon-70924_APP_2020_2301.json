  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed development, by reason of its siting (in rear gardens), orientation, layout and site coverage, would disrupt the established pattern of development within the immediate setting of the site, and would fail to harmonise with the existing local and historic context of the surrounding area. The principle of intensifying the residential use of the site to the level proposed, in conjunction with the proposed loss of existing private rear garden areas, would have a detrimental impact on the character, appearance and local distinctiveness of the residential area as a whole. The proposal is therefore detrimental to the visual amenity and character of its surroundings and contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), Policies 3.5, 7.1 and 7.4 of the London Plan (2016), Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies (2012) and Policies DMH 6, DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The proposal would not be provide any off-street parking provision contrary to the car parking requirements set out in Appendix C Table 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020). Furthermore, the proposal has not demonstrated that the surrounding roads and car park adjoining the site could accommodate the increased demand for street parking spaces. The proposal would therefore have an unacceptable adverse impact on highway safety contrary to paragraph 109 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), Policies 6.3 and 6.13 of the London Plan (2016) and Policies DMT 1, DMT 2 and DMT 6 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The proposed development, by virtue of its close proximity to the adjoining car park and absence of a dedicated footway leading directly to the site, would fail to provide safe and secure access for future occupiers, including cyclists, which in turn, would have an unacceptable impact on highway safety. The proposal would therefore conflict with paragraph 109 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), Policy 6.9 of the London Plan (2016), and Policies DMT 1, DMT 2, DMT 5 and DMHB 15 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "Insufficient details have been provided to demonstrate that refuse and recycling store provision could be provided at the site in a convenient and accessible location for future occupiers, and that refuse collection vehicles could service the site without unacceptably prejudicing highway safety. The proposal would therefore conflict with the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), Policies DMT 1, DMT 2 and DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan - The Spatial Development Strategy for London consolidated with alterations since 2011 (2016) and national guidance.",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2016). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020."
