    "The proposed development would constitute a piecemeal form of backland development that would fail to maintain the open and verdant character and appearance of the surrounding area. The proposal is therefore contrary to Part One Policy BE1 and Part 2 Policies BE13 and BE19 of the adopted Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Saved UDP Policies (November 2012), DMH6, DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 - Development Management Policies with Modifications (March 2019) and Policy 3.5 of the London Plan (March 2016).",
    "The proposed development, by reason of its design, would result in a building which would detract from the character and appearance of the street scene, causing harm to the visual amenities of the surrounding area. The proposal is, therefore, contrary to Part 1 Policy BE1, Part 2 Policies BE13 and BE19 of the Hillingdon Local Plan (November 2012) and DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 - Development Management Policies with Modifications (March 2019).",
    "The proposal, by reason of the excessive encroachment into the root protection area of the Grand Fir Tree (T16) which makes a valuable contribution to the character and visual amenity of the area would be detrimental to the environmental quality of the area and the character, appearance and visual amenities of the street scene. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies BE13, BE19 and BE38 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Saved UDP Policies (November 2012) and policy DMHB 12 and DMHB 14 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 - Development Management Policies With Modifications (March 2019).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Unitary Development Plan Saved Policies (September 2007) as incorporated into the Hillingdon Local Plan (2012) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan - The Spatial Development Strategy for London consolidated with alterations since 2011 (2016) and national guidance.",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant saved policies (referred to as policies from the Hillingdon Unitary Development Plan - Saved Policies September 2007), then London Plan Policies (2016).  On the 8th November 2012 Hillingdon's Full Council agreed the adoption of the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies. Appendix 5 of this explains which saved policies from the old Unitary Development (which was subject to a direction from Secretary of State in September 2007 agreeing that the policies were 'saved') still apply for development control decisions.",
    "You are advised that the proposed development represents chargeable development under the London Borough of Hillingdon and the Mayor's Community Infrastructure Levy Charging Schedules. Should the application be subject to an appeal which was allowed the development would be liable."
