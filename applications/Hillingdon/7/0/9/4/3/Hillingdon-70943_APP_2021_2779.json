    "The proposed development, by reason of its siting, layout, site coverage and design would result in an incongruous and cramped form of back land development that would unacceptably harm the character and appearance of the area. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 - Strategic Policies (2012), Polices DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMH 6 of Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 (2020), Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021) and Chapter 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The proposed dwellings, by virtue of poor levels of light and natural ventilation, compromised outlook and lack of privacy, would result in substandard living conditions to the detriment of future residents. In addition, the lengthy and hemmed in pedestrian accessway would fail to provide a safe, accessible and convenient route to the dwellings, to the further detriment of future residents and visitors. The proposed development is therefore contrary to Policies DMHB 16 and DMT 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020), Policies D3, D5 and D6 of the London Plan (2021) and Chapter 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "In the absence of a satisfactory section 106 legal agreement to prohibit the residents of all dwellings from obtaining residential parking permits in the controlled parking zone, the proposal would result in unacceptable parking pressure on the highway, contrary to policies DMT 1, DMT 2 and DMT 6 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2, and policy T4 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan (2021) and national guidance.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "This is a reminder that Under the terms of the Planning Act 2008 (as amended) and Community Infrastructure Levy Regulations 2010 (as amended), should an application for appeal be allowed, the proposed development would be deemed as 'chargeable development' and therefore liable to pay the London Borough of Hillingdon Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and the Mayor of London's Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This would be calculated in accordance with the London Borough of Hillingdon CIL Charging Schedule 2014 and the Mayor of London's CIL Charging Schedule 2012.
