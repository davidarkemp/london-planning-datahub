    "The Ash trees are situated within the rear garden of 6 Glynswood Place combined they have a moderate amenity value and contribute to the arboricultural character of the local area.",
    "A 50% thin is excessive and will likely lead to the creation of lion-tailing within the canopy. The applicant would also like to reduce the height of the trees however they have not specified how much they would like to remove. No arboricultural reasonings have been provided as to why the work is required.",
    "Having regard to the reasons given for the proposed work, the work is unjustified and will have a detrimental impact on the visual amenity and arboreal character of the area.",
    "The removal of deadwood, dangerous / hanging branches and ivy:  This does not require the formal consent of the Council."
