    "The proposal would, by virtue of its depth, bulk and height, result in a large built form which would be harmful to the amenities of the neighbouring occupiers No 131 and 135 Cromwell Road, through loss of light and outlook, contrary to Policies DMHD1 and DMHB11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two (2020), which seek to protect residential amenity.",
    "The proposal, due to its scale and bulk, would appear incongruous with the prevailing pattern of development within the area and fail to read as a subordinate to the host building, contrary to Policies DMHD1 and DMHB11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two (2020)",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
