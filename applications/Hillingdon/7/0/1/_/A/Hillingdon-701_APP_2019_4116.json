    "In the absence of sufficient information, it is not possible to ascertain the impact of the proposal on the historic fabric and features of this Grade II Listed Building. By virtue of this and the fact that the proposal could result in the loss of/damage to historic fabric and features, the proposal is contrary to Policy HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 1 and DMHB 2 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), Policy 7.8 of the London Plan (March 2016) and the National Planning Policy Framework.",

    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the 'Saved' UDP 2007, Local Plan Part 1, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably. In addition further guidance was offered to the applicant by the case officer during the processing of the application to identify the amendments to address those elements of the scheme considered unacceptable which the applicant chose not to implement."
