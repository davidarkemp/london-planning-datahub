  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed development, by virtue of its size, siting and the positioning of windows and doors is capable of independent living accommodation. As a result, the proposal would be tantamount to a separate self-contained residential unit in a position where such a dwelling would be unacceptable, resulting in harm to the character of the surrounding area and would be considered to result in less than substantial harm to the Eastcote (Morford Way) Conservation Area without sufficient public benefit to outweigh the harm.  The proposal is, therefore, contrary to Policies BE1 and HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2021) and DMH 6, DMHD 2, DMHB 4 and DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), and Chapter 16 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023).",
    "The proposed development would provide internal floorspace below the minimum required standards for a single storey self-contained residential unit with one bedroom. This would give rise to a substandard form of living accommodation to the detriment of the amenity of any future occupiers. The development also would not have access to a dedicated private amenity space and would compromise the quality of the private amenity space dedicated to Number 12 Morford Way. The proposal is thus contrary to Policy DMHB 16 and DMHB 18 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021) and Chapter 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023), and the Technical Housing Standards - Nationally Described Space Standard (2015).",
    "The proposed development is considered capable of independent living accommodation tantamount to a separate self-contained residential unit and due to its location within the private garden space of Number 12 Morford Way, the development would compromise the privacy and amenity of neighbouring properties, in particular Number 12 Morford Way. For this reason, the development is contrary to Policy DMHB 11, part B), of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service."
