    "The proposed development, given the number of potential occupants (9/10) would give rise to undue noise and general disturbance to neighbouring residents, particularly as a result of a marked increase in comings and goings and the use of the rear garden. The proposal would therefore be contrary to the requirements of Policies DMH 5 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and paragraph 130 (f) of the NPPF (2021).",
    "Due to its undersized rooms and limited garden space, the proposed HMO would provide existing and future residents with cramped and unsatisfactory living accommodation to the detriment of their amenities. The proposal is therefore considered to be contrary to paragraph 130 (f) of the NPPF, Policy D6 of the London Plan and Policy DMH 5 of the Hillingdon Local Plan : Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The proposed development would fail to provide adequate car parking to serve the proposed increase in occupants at the site, resulting in increased road side parking, additional traffic, and a more hazardous environment for pedestrian and road users.  The proposed development is therefore considered to be contrary to Policies T2, T4, T5 and T6 of the London Plan (2021) and Policies DMH 5, DMT 1, DMT 2 and DMT 6 of the Hillingdon Local Plan - Part 2: Development Management Policies (2020), as well as paragraph 111 of the NPPF (2021).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan (2021) and national guidance."
