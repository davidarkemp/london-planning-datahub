  "description": "Demolition of existing dwelling and erection of two storey detached building with habitable roof space to provide 9 x 2-bed flats with associated amenity space and parking.",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed development, by reason of its siting, size, scale and design, including a crown roof form, would fail to harmonise with the character and architectural composition of surrounding properties, appearing as an awkward, incongruous and bulky form of development which would be detrimental to the visual amenity of the street scene and harmful to the character and appearance of the surrounding Conservation Area, contrary to Policies BE1 and HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 4, DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the of the adopted Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020) and Policies 3.5 and 7.4 of the London Plan (2016).",
    "The proposed development by virtue of its size, layout, height of the windows (in particular the rear dormer windows) and its proximity to neighbouring properties (in particular 1 Neela Close and 19 Milton Road) would be detrimental to the amenities of the adjoining occupiers by reason of loss of privacy. It is not considered that landscape retention could overcome these concerns. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policy DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies.",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2016). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service."
