    "The proposed development, by reason of its size, scale, massing and design (including its uncharacteristic crown roof profile and lack of detail in respect to the height of the proposed sky lights) , would fail to harmonise with the character and architectural composition of the surrounding properties, appearing as a visually dominant, incongruous and bulky form of development which would be detrimental to the visual amenity of the street scene and would neither preserve or enhance but harm the character and appearance of the surrounding Conservation Area. The proposal therefore conflicts with Policies BE1 and HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One- Strategic Policies (2012) and Policies DMHB 1, DMHB 4, DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020), Policies HC1, D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The proposed development, by virtue of the substandard internal floor area of the single bedrooms,  would result in substandard forms of residential accommodation to the detriment of future occupants of Flats 1, 2, 5 and 6.  The proposal would therefore result in substandard forms of residential accommodation to the detriment of the amenity of future occupants of the proposed development, contrary to Policy DMHB 16 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The proposed development, by virtue of the internal layout of the loft space and position of the proposed rear dormer, skylights and roof lights, would result in poor outlook and an oppressive living environment for the future occupiers of Flat 9. The proposal would therefore result in substandard forms of residential accommodation to the detriment of the amenity of future occupants of the proposed development, contrary to Policy DMHB 16 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "In the absence of an updated Arboricultural Impact Assessment, Method Statement and Tree Protection Plan, the application has failed to demonstrate that the proposed development could be constructed without undue harm to the trees at and adjoining the site which are protected by Tree Preservation Order number 5. The potential harm caused to the protected trees would undermine the verdant character and visual amenity of the surrounding Conservation Area.  The proposal therefore conflicts with Policies BE1 and HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One- Strategic Policies (2012) and Policies DMHB 1, DMHB 4, DMHB 11 DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020), Policies HC1, D3, D4 and G7 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "a) We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal.",
    "This is a reminder that Under the terms of the Planning Act 2008 (as amended) and Community Infrastructure Levy Regulations 2010 (as amended), should an application for appeal be allowed, the proposed development would be deemed as 'chargeable development' and therefore liable to pay the London Borough of Hillingdon Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and the Mayor of London's Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This would be calculated in accordance with the London Borough of Hillingdon CIL Charging Schedule 2014 and the Mayor of London's CIL Charging Schedule 2012.",
