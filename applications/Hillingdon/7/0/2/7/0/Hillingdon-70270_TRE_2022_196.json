    "The tree to be pruned shall be crown reduced as per the approved specification. This work shall comprise a reduction in both height and spread over the whole crown by shortening or removing peripheral branches in a uniform and systematic manner.  Where branches are shortened, they should be cut back to a suitably positioned secondary branch.",
    "Crown reduction shall not be construed as 'lopping' or 'topping' and shall result in a tree of typical form for the species and of balanced appearance. The works shall be carried out in accordance with the recommendations contained in BS 3998:2010 'Tree work - Recommendations'. Climbing irons or 'spikes' shall not be used during the execution of the work.",
    "REASON",
    "In order to protect health of the tree and the visual amenity of the area.",
    "The removal of deadwood, dangerous / hanging branches and ivy:  This does not require the formal consent of the Council.",
    "Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981:  Note that it is an offence under this act to disturb roosting bats, nesting birds or any other protected species.  Therefore, if applicable, it is advisable to consult your tree surgeon / consultant to agree an acceptable time for carrying out the approved works.",
    "Owner(s)'s permission:  Permission should be sought from the owner(s) of the tree(s) and / or the owner(s) of the land that the tree(s) overhang prior to any approved work being carried out.",
    "Expected standard of tree work: The approved works must be carried out in accordance with the conditions laid out above. If they are not, then enforcement action could being taken which could lead to prosecution and heavy fines. Therefore, it is highly recommended that the works are only carried out by a professional and competent arboriculturist who undertakes to comply with the conditions of this consent and in accordance with industry best practice (BS 3998:2010). The Arboricultural Association can provide details of its approved contractors, who have demonstrated such professionalism and competence, on their website (www.trees.org.uk) or by calling 01242 522152. Or on request the Council can provide a list of contractors who are known to carry out tree work to a good standard and to normally maintain an appropriate policy of indemnity insurance."
