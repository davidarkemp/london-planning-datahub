    "The proposed development, by reason of its siting (in a rear garden), design, layout, and site coverage, would result in a cramped development of the site, which is visually incongruous (given the setting) and would fail to harmonise with the existing local and historic context of the surrounding area. The principle of intensifying the residential use of the site, as well as the proposed loss of existing private rear garden area, would have a detrimental impact on the character and appearance of the residential area as a whole. The proposal would be detrimental to the visual amenity and character and appearance of the site and surrounding area and contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), Policies D3, D4 and D6 of the London Plan (2021), guidance within The London Plan Housing Supplementary Planning Guidance (Mar",
    "The proposal has not demonstrated that provision of the on-site car parking and layout is as a result of a satisfactory policy-led approach and therefore the development is considered to result in conditions prejudicial to public and highway safety and contrary to policies DMT 2 and DMT 6 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020) and Policies T6 and T6.1 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "The proposed development, by reason of the siting of the proposed access road to the rear and its use by vehicles and pedestrians, in to the adjoining properties, would be detrimental to the amenities of the adjoining occupiers at 100 and 102 Dawley Road, by reason of noise and disturbance. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy EM8 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policy DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan - Part Two (2020) and Policy D14 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "The proposal would result in the procision of a crossoverof excessive width to the detriment of pedestrian and highway safety and contrary to Policies DMT 2 and DMT 6 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan - The Spatial Development Strategy for London consolidated with alterations since 2011 (2016) and national guidance.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "This is a reminder that Under the terms of the Planning Act 2008 (as amended) and Community Infrastructure Levy Regulations 2010 (as amended), should an application for appeal be allowed, the proposed development would be deemed as 'chargeable development' and therefore liable to pay the London Borough of Hillingdon Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and the Mayor of London's Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This would be calculated in accordance with the London Borough of Hillingdon CIL Charging Schedule 2014 and the Mayor of London's CIL Charging Schedule 2012.
