    "The proposal, by reason of its size, bulk, design and proximity, with inadequate separation distances between it and the neighbouring properties at Nos  15, 17 and 19 Ballinger Way , would result in an overly dominant, visually intrusive and an un-neighbourly form of development, resulting in a material loss of residential amenity. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to policies DMHD1 and DMHB11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan - Part Two (2020).",
    "The proposed projecting balcony on the front elevation would be out of character with the visual consistency of this master planned development, adversely affecting the character and visual amenity of the street scene in this prominent location. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policies DMHB11 and DMHB12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan - Part Two (2020).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service."
