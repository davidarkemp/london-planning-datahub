    "The proposed development, by reason of the existence of an independent access and the provision of facilities within, is considered capable of independent occupation from the main dwelling. As a result, the proposal would be tantamount to a separate self-contained residential unit in a position where such a dwelling would be unacceptable, due to requirements for parking, living accommodation and amenity space and the impact on adjoining properties. The proposal is, therefore, contrary to Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 16, DMHB 18, DMT 2 and DMT 6 of the  Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and Policies D6 and T6 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
