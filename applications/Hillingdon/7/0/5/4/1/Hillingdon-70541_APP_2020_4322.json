  "description": "Part two storey, part single storey rear extension.",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed part two storey, part single storey rear extension, by virtue of its excessive scale, bulk, depth, width and design, including the introduction of a flat roof profile, would appear as an incongruous and disproportionate addition that would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original semi-detached dwelling, would be detrimental to the character, appearance and symmetry of the pair of semi-detached houses of which it forms a part and to the visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2019).",
    "The proposed part two storey, part single storey rear extension, by virtue of its excessive scale, bulk and depth would  unduly detract from the amenities of the adjoining occupiers at Numbers 198 and 202 Ladygate Lane  by reason of visual intrusion, overdominance, overshadowing, loss of daylight, loss of sunlight and loss of outlook. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policies DMHB11 and DMHD1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "In the absence of a Flood Risk Assessment being submitted, the application has failed to address the issues relating to flood risk and has failed to provide adequate solutions to mitigate the flood risk caused by the additional footprint created by the proposed works. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policy EM6 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMEI 8 and DMEI 9 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), Policies 5.12 and 5.13 of The London Plan (2016), the National Planning Policy Framework (2019) and Planning Practice Guidance (March 2014).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2016). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service."
