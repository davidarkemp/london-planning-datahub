  "description": "Change of use from unrestricted Class B8 open storage to a restricted use for positioning of up to 68 containers for self-storage use.",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The development represents inappropriate development within the Green Belt and no very special circumstances have been provided which either singularly or cumulatively overcome the presumption against inappropriate development in the Green Belt. The proposal is therefore contrary to the aims of Policy EM2 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies OL1 and OL4 of the the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Saved UDP Policies (November 2012), Policy DMEI 4 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies With Modifications (March 2019), Policy 7.16 of the London Plan (2016) and the National Planning Policy Framework (February 2019).",
    "The positioning and scale of the proposed containers is close proximity to the boundaries of the site would be clearly visible within the street scene and the wider open countryside to the detriment of the visual amenity of the wider area.  The proposal is therefore contrary to the aims of Policies BE13 and BE19 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Saved UDP Policies (November 2012).",
    "The proposal has failed to demonstrate that the use of the land for the positioning of up to 68 containers on the land would not result in an unacceptable rise in intensity and frequency of traffic movements in and around the application site. It is therefore considered that the proposal would be detrimental to highway and pedestrian safety contrary to Policies AM7 and AM14 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Saved UDP Policies (November 2012), Policies DMT 1 and DMT 2 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies With Modifications (March 2019) and Policy 6.12 of the London Plan (March 2016).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant saved policies (referred to as policies from the Hillingdon Unitary Development Plan - Saved Policies September 2007), then the policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies With Modifications (March 2019), then London Plan Policies (March 2016).  On the 8th November 2012 Hillingdon's Full Council agreed the adoption of the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies. Appendix 5 of this explains which saved policies from the old Unitary Development (which was subject to a direction from Secretary of State in September 2007 agreeing that the policies were 'saved') still apply for development control decisions.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the 'Saved' UDP 2007, Local Plan Part 1, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
