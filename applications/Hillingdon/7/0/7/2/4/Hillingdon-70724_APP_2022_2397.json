    "The proposed two storey side and first floor rear extension, by virtue of its combined design, scale, height and massing including the squat crown roof design and wraparound design of the first floor side and rear extension, would result in , bulky, visually intrusive, disproportionate, incongruous and overbearing addition that would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original dwelling, relationship with neighbouring properties, visual amenities of the streetscene and would fail to preserve or enhance the character and appearance of the Ruilsip, Manor Way Conservation Area.  Therefore, the proposal would be contrary to Policies HC1, D1 and D3 of the London Plan (2021). Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012), Policies DMHB 4, DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and Sections 12 and 16 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021)",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2021). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020."
