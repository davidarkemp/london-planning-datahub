    "The proposed development has failed to demonstrate that unacceptable levels of noise and disturbance to surrounding residential occupiers would not occur. In the absence of any noise surveys or noise mitigation measures, the proposed development is considered to result in noise and disturbance to the detriment of the amenity of adjoining occupiers, contrary to Policies DMHB 11 and DMTC 4 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and Policy D14 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "The proposed development, by virtue of its size, scale, bulk, depth, height and proximity, would be detrimental to the amenities of the adjoining occupier at 2 Hewens Road by reason of overdominance, overshadowing, visual intrusion, loss of light and loss of outlook. Therefore, the proposal would be contrary to Policy DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal.",
    "This is a reminder that Under the terms of the Planning Act 2008 (as amended) and Community Infrastructure Levy Regulations 2010 (as amended), should an application for appeal be allowed, the proposed development would be deemed as 'chargeable development' and therefore liable to pay the London Borough of Hillingdon Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and the Mayor of London's Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This would be calculated in accordance with the London Borough of Hillingdon CIL Charging Schedule 2014 and the Mayor of London's CIL Charging Schedule 2012.
