    "The proposed extension, by reason of its size, scale, bulk and design would diminish an existing gap and unique catslide roof feature and would result in an excessive, bulky, dominant, overbearing and visually intrusive form of development that would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original dwelling, would be detrimental to the character, appearance and symmetry of the similar detached dwellings along St Margarets Road, which it forms a relationship to and the visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020)."
