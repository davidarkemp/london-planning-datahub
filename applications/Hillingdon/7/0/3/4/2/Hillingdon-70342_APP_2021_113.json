    "The proposal would result in the provision of 2 parking spaces of insufficient depth and in a crossover of excessive width, immediately adjacent to an existing crossover and would make inadequate provision for pedestrian refuge and would therefore be prejudicial to pedestrian and highway safety. As a result it would be contrary to Policy DMT 2 of the Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The proposed development would result in an excessive area of hardstanding being provided at the front of the house with a consequent reduction in the overall provision of front garden area/amenity space and landscaping. This would be detrimental to the character and visual appearance of the street scene and surrounding area, contrary to Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of of the Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service."
