    "The multi stem Cherry tree is situated within the front garden of 20 Woodstock Drive. It is a prominent feature within the road especially when approaching from Gibson Road and as a result has a high amenity value. The resident is planning to remove all the trees/shrubs from within the front garden, apart from the cherry the resident does not require council permission to carry out this work however once the other vegetation is removed this will increase the amenity value of the TPO Cherry tree. The Cherry significantly contributes to the arboricultural character of the area.",
    "The tree is situated to the North West of the property and as a result shading will be minimal, it might cause shade to some of the property's driveway but this is insignificant in comparison to the shading to the driveway from the building. In relation to the tree damaging the blocked paving the resident has ticked yes to question 6.2 Alleged damage to property however, no exploratory investigations have been car",
    "The removal of deadwood, dangerous / hanging branches and ivy:  This does not require the formal consent of the Council."
