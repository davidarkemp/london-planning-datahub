    "The removal of deadwood, dangerous / hanging branches and ivy:  This does not require the formal consent of the Council.",
    "Statutory crown lifting of trees: This does not require formal consent of the Council if the clearance only involves the removal of branches to give a separation between the footway and the tips of the lowest branches by up to 2.3m or the carriageway by up to 5.2m.",
    "Clearance of telephone wires: Work to free telephone wires / cables, by cutting back secondary and tertiary branches to provide up to 500 mm clearance between the wires / cables and tree branches (i.e. forming corridors through the canopy and thereby abating the nuisance) does not require the formal consent of the Council.",
    "The medium-mature Beech tree is situated in the front garden of the property on a grass lawn. It has a moderate amenity value due to previous poor tree work. This is one of few Beech trees in the area and it can be seen by a dozen plus houses, as well as any path and road users. The tree is located within the Hillingdon Court Park Area of Special Local Character.",
    "The tree has previously had poor arboricultural work completed and that has lowered its amenity value. But, it has started to recover from this and will continue to do so, providing a moderate amenity. The tree can also be seen by many and is one of few of its species in the area, this also raises its amenity value.",
    "We have refused this application due to the lack of arboricultural reasons given for the work and the amenity value that the tree provides."
