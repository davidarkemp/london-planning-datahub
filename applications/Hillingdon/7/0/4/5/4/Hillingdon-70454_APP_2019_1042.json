The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies AM7 and AM14 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Unitary Development Plan Saved Policies (November 2012), to Hillingdon's Adopted Parking Standards as set out in the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Unitary Development Plan Saved Policies (November 2012), Polices DMT 5, DMT 6 and the Parking Standard of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies With Modifications (March 2019), Policies 6.3, 6.9, 6.10 and 6.13 of the London Plan (2016) and National Planning Policy Framework (2019).",

In the absence of more robust evidence provided by the developer , the Highway Authority cannot be sure that the proposal would not have a severe impact on the operation of the surrounding road network and the viability of the Industrial Business Area, within which the site is located.
