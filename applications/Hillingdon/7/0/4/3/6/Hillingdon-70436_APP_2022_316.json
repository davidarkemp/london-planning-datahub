  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposal for an extension to the existing garage, by reason of its excessive size, scale, layout, height and separate entrance from Dorset Way is considered capable of independent occupation from the main dwelling and is thus tantamount to a separate dwelling in a position where such a dwelling would not be acceptable. The proposal is therefore contrary to policies DMHB 11, DMHD2, DMHB 18 and DMT 6 of the London Borough of Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two-Development Management Policies (2020) and Policy D6 of the London Plan.",
    "The proposed extension to existing garage, by virtue of its size, scale, footprint, bulk, height and design would be out of keeping for its surrounding area. Thus, would be detrimental to the character and appearance of the surrounding area of The Rise and Dorset Way. Therefore, the proposal would be contrary to Policies Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One Strategic Policies (2012), Paragraph A1.34, Policy DMHB 11, Policy DMHB 12 and Policy DMHD 2 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2016). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020."
