    "The proposed extension by reason of its overall size, height, bulk and design, in conjunction with the existing extensions and site context, would fail to appear subordinate to the original property and terrace of which it forms part of. It would represent an over development of the site and an incongruous and out of character addition, which would be detrimental to the visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area generally. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), policies DMHB11; DMHB12 and DMHD1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan - Part One (2020) and policies D3 and D8 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "The proposed first floor rear extension, by reason of its overall size, height, bulk, design and proximity to the boundary, in combination with the existing extensions and site context, would be detrimental to the residential amenities of the adjoining occupier at No.87 Braybourne Close and neighbour at Number 88 Braybourne Close by reason of  loss light, loss of outlook, overshadowing, overlooking, overdominance and overbearing effect. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policies DMHB11 and DMHD1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan - Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020)."
