  "description": "Demolition of existing house and erection of 5 separate dwellings with associated landscaping and parking",
  "decision_date": "03/03/2023",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "By virtue of the backland location, expanse of additional hardstanding, lack of landscaping and biodiversity opportunities, excessive height, neighbour impact and inconsistency in siting and alignment, the proposed development constitutes inappropriate development of a residential garden and would be contrary to Paragraph 130 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021 and Policies BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan (Part 1) 2012, Policies DMH 6 and DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan (Part 2) 2020",
    "By virtue of the raising of the ground level, lack of consistency with the existing pattern of development, poor design treatments and excessive scale, footprint, height and density of the backland development, the proposal represents over development of the site and poses an unsatisfactory impact upon the setting and character of the neighbourhood. The proposal is therefore contrary to Sections 11 and 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021, Policies GC2, D2 and D3 of the London Plan 2021, Policy B1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan (Part 1) 2012 and Policies DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan (Part 2) 2020.",
    "By virtue of its inconsistent siting, width and separation, the replacement dwelling on Uxbridge Road does not conform appropriately with the rhythm and pattern of the street scene, contrary to Sections 11 and 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021, Policy D8 of the London Plan 2021, Policy B1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan (Part 1) 2012 and Policies DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan (Part 2) 2020.",
    "By virtue of the raising of the ground level, excessive building height, blank side facade and a inadequate setback from the north eastern boundary, the development will pose unacceptable neighbour amenity impacts to the rear garden and habitable areas of Cottesloe and Leederville, including dominance, loss of outlook, loss of sunlight and daylight and sense of enclosure, contrary to Policies BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan (Part 1) 2012 and Policies DMHB 1, DMHD 11 and DMH 6 of the Hillingdon Local Plan (Part 2) 2020.",
    "By virtue of the inappropriate siting of the proposed access alongside an existing and proposed dropped kerb and within a bus stop, the introduction of a new access for the replacement dwelling at Dellfield which allows unsafe reversing manoeuvres onto Uxbridge Road, the single width access into the site that would raise potential for unsafe reversing back onto Uxbridge Road, inadequate turning space for cars and refuse vehicles within the rear car park and inadequate pedestrian visibility at the entrance, the proposal represents an unsatisfactory highway arrangement and a high likelihood of risk to vehicular conflict, pedestrian safety and impediment to traffic flows on Uxbridge Road. This is contrary to Section 9 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021, Policy T4 of the London Plan 2021, Policies DMT 1 and DMT 2 of the Hillingdon Local Plan (Part 2) 2020, and Section 4.7.1 of the Hillingdon Domestic Vehicle Footway Crossover Policy.",
    "By virtue of the excessive density and need to meet highway technical requirements, there are inadequate opportunities for soft landscaping, tree planting and biodiversity enhancements to the front and rear of the dwellings on the backland site. There would be an adverse impact upon protected species, nature conservation and the landscape setting, contrary to Section 15 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021, Policy G6 of the London Plan 2021, Policies BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan (Part 1) 2012 and Policies DMH 6, DMHB 14 and DMEI 7 of the Hillingdon Local Plan (Part 2) 2020.",
    "The part subterranean location, room depth and concealed location of the window behind the staircase of bedroom 2 within each of the four backland dwellings adversely compromises the internal amenity of the bedroom, contrary to Section 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021, Policies D6 and D10 of the London Plan 2021, Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan (Part 1) 2012 and Policy DMH 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan (Part 2) 2012",
    "By virtue of the siting of the access road serving the rear backland development immediately alongside the windows of Beechcroft and the replacement dwelling at Dellfield, the proposal would likely result in unacceptable levels of air and noise pollution to existing and future occupiers, contrary to Section 15 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021, Policy SI 1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DMEI 14 of the Hillingdon Local Plan (Part 2) 2020.",
    "In the absence of a swept path assessment and detailed plans for the waste collection area for the backland development, it is not possible to conclude that refuse collection can be achieved in a satisfactory manner or that there is sufficient space for on site storage of waste, recycling, green waste and food waste, contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan (Part 1) 2012 and Policy DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan (Part 2) 2020.",
    "With two of the three bedrooms of each of the four backland dwellings significantly below the minimum surface flood level as identified in the Flood Risk Assessment and Basement Impact Assessment and with additional flood risks posed by the proposed soakaways and no suitable level of mitigation, the proposed basement habitable accommodation poses a flood risk to future occupiers, contrary to Section 14 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021, Policy D10 of the London Plan and Policies DMHD 3 and DMEI 9 of the Hillingdon Local Plan (Part 2) 2020.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service. We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
