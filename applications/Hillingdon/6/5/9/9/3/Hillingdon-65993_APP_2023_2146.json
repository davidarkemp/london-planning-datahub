    "By virtue of the lack of consistency with the existing pattern of development, poor design and excessive scale, footprint, height and density of the backland development, the proposal represents over development of the site and poses an unsatisfactory impact upon the setting and character of the neighbourhood. The proposal is therefore contrary to Sections 11 and 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021, Policies GC2, D2 and D3 of the London Plan 2021, Policy B1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan (Part 1) 2012 and Policies DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan (Part 2) 2020.",

    "By virtue of the siting of the access road serving the rear backland development immediately alongside the adjacent dwelling 'Leederville' and the proposed replacement dwelling 'House 1', the proposal would likely result in unacceptable levels noise pollution to existing and future occupiers, contrary to Section 15 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021, Policy SI 1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DMEI 14 of the Hillingdon Local Plan (Part 2) 2020.",
    "By virtue of the inappropriate siting of the proposed access within a bus stop the proposed development would create a more hazardous highways network. Furthermore it has not been demonstrated that vehicles could enter and exit the site in forward gear. Cars reversing onto the road would reduce pedestrian and highways safety, whilst also causing traffic build up and congestion on the busy Uxbridge Road. This is contrary to Section 9 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021, Policy T4 of the London Plan 2021, Policies DMT 1 and DMT 2 of the Hillingdon Local Plan (Part 2) 2020, and Section 4.7.1 of the Hillingdon Domestic Vehicle Footway Crossover Policy.",

    "The occupiers of Leederville will also be subjected to an unacceptable loss of outlook, due to the size, height and location and overbearing impact of House 2, contrary to Policies BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan (Part 1) 2012 and Policies DMHB 11 and DMH 6 of the Hillingdon Local Plan (Part 2) 2020, as well as paragraph 130 (f) of the NPPF (2021)."
