    "In the absence of a robust, thorough and well supported needs assessment advocating for a special needs school in this location, it has not been adequately demonstrated that there is a need for the proposal. It has also not been adequately demonstrated that the floor area of the proposal would comply with relevant Ofsted SEND space standards. The proposal would also result in the loss of a community facility and no details have been provided with regards to any relocated facility. Consequently, the principle of development is considered to be unacceptable. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies DMCI 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policies S1 and S3 of the London Plan (2021) and Paragraphs 88 and 97 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023).",
    "The proposed rear extension, by virtue of its excessive size, width, bulk and massing, would appear as an insubordinate and incongruous form of development that would fail to respect the form and architectural composition of the host building and would be harmful to the character and appearance of the surrounding area. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policies BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012), Policies DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021) and Paragraphs 128, 131 and 135 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023).",
    "The proposed rear extension, by virtue of its excessive size, height, bulk, depth, massing and proximity to the neighbouring boundary, would be detrimental to the amenities of the neighbouring occupiers at James House, by reason of creating a sense of enclosure, overdominance, overshadowing, visual intrusion and loss of outlook. In addition, the proposed south facing rooflights would result in overlooking and loss of privacy of the neighbouring occupiers at No.11 Albert Road. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policies BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012), Policy DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021) and 135 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023).",
    "The proposal, by virtue of the lack of accessible toilet, unacceptable car parking and travel plan, would not achieve the highest standards of accessible and inclusive design. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies D5 and S3 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "In the absence of an acceptable construction logistics plan, a robust travel plan and a s106 agreement to secure the required off-site parking, and by virtue of the failure to provide an acceptable level of parking within the application site, the development would increase parking stress and prejudice highway safety. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies DMT 1, DMT 2, DMT 5 and DMT 6 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policies T2, T4, T6 of the London Plan (2021) and Paragraphs 115 and 116 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2021). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
