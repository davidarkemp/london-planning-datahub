    "The proposal, by reason of its size, design and bulk, including the proposed crown roof and gable end would result in an incongruous, unsympathetic and visually intrusive form of development that would not be a subordinate addition to the existing dwellinghouse, would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original dwelling and would be detrimental to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the surrounding area. Therefore, the proposed development would be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan (November 2012), Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan - Part Two (2020) and Policies D3 of the London Plan (2021) and Chapter 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The proposed rear/side infill extension by virtue of its size, scale, bulk, depth and proximity, would be detrimental to the amenities of the neighbouring occupier at 20 The Uplands, by reason of overdominance, overshadowing, visual intrusion, loss of light and loss of outlook. Therefore, the proposal would be contrary to Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020)."
