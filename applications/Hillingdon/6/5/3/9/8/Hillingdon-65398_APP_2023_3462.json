    "The proposed single storey rear/side infill extension by virtue of its size, scale, bulk, depth and proximity, would be detrimental to the amenities of the neighbouring occupier at 16 The Uplands, by reason of overdominance, overshadowing, visual intrusion, loss of light and loss of outlook. Therefore, the proposal would be contrary to Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020)."
