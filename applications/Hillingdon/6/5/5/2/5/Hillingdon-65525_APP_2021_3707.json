    "The proposed development would result in the net loss of a three-bedroom dwelling (i.e. a family sized unit) and fails to provide any three or more bedroom (family sized) units. Robust justification has not been provided to demonstrate that the provision of family sized units would be unsuitable or unviable. The proposal would therefore not provide a suitable mix of housing to support sustainable, inclusive and mixed communities contrary to Policy DMH 2 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy H10 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The proposed development, by reason of its siting, width to plot ratio, size,  scale, massing, height and design (including the top-heavy crown roof profile, front light wells and conservatory style front porch), would fail to  respect the established pattern of development. Also, the proposal would fail to harmonise with the character and architectural composition of the surrounding properties, appearing as a visually dominant, incongruous and bulky form of development which would be detrimental to the visual amenity of the street scene and harmful to the character and appearance of the surrounding area. The proposal therefore conflicts with Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One- Strategic Policies (2012) , Policies DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020), Policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "In the absence of an Arboricultural Impact Assessment, Method Statement and Tree Protection Plan, the application has failed to demonstrate that the proposed development could be constructed without undue harm to the trees at and adjoining the site which are protected by Tree Preservation Order number 464.  The potential harm caused to the protected trees would undermine the character and visual amenity of the area. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One Strategic Policies (2012), Policies DMHB 11 and DMHB 14 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2: Development Management Policies (2020), Policy T5 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The proposed development, by virtue of its proximity to the shared boundary, scale, height and bulk (which includes a crown roof profile and dormers), would cause harm to the residential amenities of the occupiers at number 17 and their associated private amenity space, in terms of loss of outlook, sense of enclosure and overbearing impact. The proposal would therefore conflict with Policy DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The proposed development, by virtue of the limited separation distance from the front elevation windows of number 13A The Drive and the upper floor rear elevation windows and dormer windows of the proposed building, would result in overlooking issues and a loss of privacy for the existing occupiers at number 13A The Drive.  The proposal would therefore cause harm to the residential amenities of the occupiers at number 13A The Drive,  contrary to Policy DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The proposed development, by virtue of the position of the windows serving 'Bedroom 1' and the 'Kitchen/Dining room' at basement level, would result in a significant sense of enclosure, loss of outlook and an oppressive living environment for the future occupiers of proposed Flats 1 and 2. The proposal would therefore provide substandard forms of residential accommodation for the future occupiers of Flats 1 and 2, contrary to Policy DMHB 16 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The proposed development, by virtue of the limited separation distance from the front elevation windows of number 13A The Drive and the upper floor rear elevation windows and dormer windows of the proposed building, would result in overlooking issues and a loss of privacy for the future occupiers of Flats 3 and 4.  The proposal would therefore provide substandard forms of residential accommodation for the future occupiers of Flats 3 and 4, contrary to Policy DMHB 16 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The proposed development, by virtue of the site layout and the inadequate footway provision from the car park to the sole entrances points of Flats 1 and 2, would fail to provide safe and suitable access within the site for all users (including those with disabilities).  As a result, the proposal would lead to conflict between road users and pedestrians which would cause harm to highway safety.  The proposal therefore conflicts with Policies DMT 1 and DMT 2 of the  Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy T4 of the London Plan (2021) and paragraphs 110 and 111 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The proposed development, by virtue of its access arrangements, internal design of the building (with the absence of any lift provision), flatted development nature and absence of details to show that the internal layout would comply with Approved Document M of Building Regulation requirement M4(2) and M4(3), fails to demonstrate that adequate provision would be made to meet the needs of people with disabilities. The proposed development therefore conflicts with Policies D5 and D7 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "In the absence of a Basement Impact Assessment by a suitably qualified person, it is not possible to properly assess the impact of the proposed development on material planning considerations, including flood risk, ground instability and the water environment.  Given that this issue is fundamental to the acceptability of the scheme, this matter needs to be addressed at application stage and cannot be dealt with by condition.  The proposal therefore fails to comply with Policies DMHD 3, DMEI 9 and DMEI 10 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020), Policies SI 12 and SI 13 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "a) We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal.",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan - The Spatial Development Strategy for London consolidated with alterations since 2011 (2016) and national guidance.",
    "This is a reminder that Under the terms of the Planning Act 2008 (as amended) and Community Infrastructure Levy Regulations 2010 (as amended), should an application for appeal be allowed, the proposed development would be deemed as 'chargeable development' and therefore liable to pay the London Borough of Hillingdon Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and the Mayor of London's Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This would be calculated in accordance with the London Borough of Hillingdon CIL Charging Schedule 2014 and the Mayor of London's CIL Charging Schedule 2012.",
