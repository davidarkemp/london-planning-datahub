    "The proposed development fails to provide sufficient off street parking provision or secure cycle storage which meets the councils approved parking standards to service the proposed dwellings.  The development would therefore lead to additional on street parking to the detriment of public and highway safety and is therefore contrary to Policies DMT2 and DMT6 of the Hillingdon Local Plan - Part Two (2020).",
    "The proposed development, by virtue of its failure to provide amenity space of sufficient size and quality commensurate to the size and layout of the said units would result in an over-development of the site detrimental to the residential amenity of existing and future occupiers. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy DMHB 18 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "The proposed development by reason of the second entrance door in an uncharacteristic position, alongside its failure to demonstrate refuse storage, cycle storage and car parking would harm the character and appearance of the host property, streetscene and wider area, all contrary to Policies DMH 4 and DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
