    "The proposed rear and roof extensions by reason of their depth, design, scale, size, bulk and massing, would appear as a top heavy and visually unsympathetic form of development that would fail to respect the original roof form and architectural composition of the original dwelling, detrimental to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the wider area and group of three detached bungalows of which it forms part. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 1,  DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy D4 and D8 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
