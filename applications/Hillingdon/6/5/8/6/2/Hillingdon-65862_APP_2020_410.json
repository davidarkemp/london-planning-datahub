    "The proposed development by reason of its siting and overall height in a prominent location, adjacent to the Ickenham Village Conservation Area and within the designated Green Belt would result in an incongruous and visually obtrusive form of development. It would harm the character and appearance of the street scene, which is characterised by only two storey buildings, the adjoining Ickenham Village Conservation Area and the Green Belt. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies BE1, HE1 and EM2 of The Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies (2012), Policies DMHB 4, DMHB 11, DMHB 21, DMEI 4 of The Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020) and Chapter 5 of the National Planning Policy Framework (March 2012).",
    "The decision to REFUSE details of siting and design has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE details of siting and design has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Unitary Development Plan Saved Policies (September 2007) as incorporated into the Hillingdon Local Plan (2012) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including the London Plan (July 2011) and national guidance."
