  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed two storey rear extension, by reason of its size, design and proximity, would result in an overly dominant feature that overshadows the adjoining property at No. 7 Cedar Close and as such would result in a visually intrusive and an un-neighbourly form of development, resulting in a loss of light and material loss of residential amenity in conflict with policies DMHB11 and DMHD1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan - Part Two (2020).",
    "The proposal, by reason of its bulk, depth and staggered siting, would fail to appear as a subordinate addition, detrimental to the appearance of the original house and spacing of development within the area. The proposal would therefore detract from the character and appearance of the dwelling and surrounding area.  The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHD 1, DMHB 11 and DMHD 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020) and Policies D3, and D8 of the London Plan (2021) and the NPPF.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
