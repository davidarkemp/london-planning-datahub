    "The proposed outbuilding by reason of its size, scale, bulk and design would fail to appear as subordinate addition to the site and would thus fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original dwelling, would be detrimental to the character, appearance and  visual amenities of the surrounding area and would fail to either preserve or enhance the character or appearance of the surrounding Ickenham Village Conservation Area. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies BE1 and HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 1, DMHB 4, DMHB 11 and DMHD 2 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), Policy HC1 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2019).",
    "In the absence of a Tree Survey and Arboricultural Implication Assessment to BS5837:2012 standards, the application has failed to demonstrate that the development will safeguard existing trees on the site and further fails to demonstrate protection for and long-term retention of the trees. The proposal is therefore detrimental to the visual amenity of the wider Ickenham Village Conservation Area contrary to Policies BE1 and HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 1, DMHB 4, DMHB 11 and DMHB 14 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), Policy HC1 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2019).",
