    "The proposed two storey side/rear extension, by virtue of its proximity to the neighbouring boundary, would be detrimental to the residential amenity of the neighbouring occupiers at No.174 Aylsham Drive, by reason of overlooking and loss of privacy. The proposal therefore conflicts with Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies  DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021) and Paragraph 130f of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The development proposal would not retain adequate off-street parking within the curtilage to serve the dwelling in accordance with adopted car parking standards. The proposal therefore conflicts with Policies DMHD 1 and DMT 6 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the Local Plan Part 1 and Local Plan Part 2. In addition further guidance was offered to the applicant by the case officer during the processing of the application to identify the amendments to address those elements of the scheme considered unacceptable which the applicant chose not to implement.",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2021). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020."
