    "By virtue of its siting, size, scale, bulk, massing and design, the proposed roof alteration/extensions and flat roof terrace would result in a dominant, incongruous and visually obtrusive form of development that would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original building and thereby cause significant harm to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the surrounding area. The proposal would therefore conflict with Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One (2012), Policies DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two (2020) and Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "By virtue of the lack of policy compliant ceiling heights, the proposed development would result in inadequate living conditions to the detriment of future occupiers. The proposal would therefore conflict with Policies DMHB 11 and DMHB 16 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two (2020) and Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021) and Paragraph 135f) of the National Planning Policy Framework (2024).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan - The Spatial Development Strategy for London consolidated with alterations since 2011 (2021) and national guidance.",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2016). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020."
