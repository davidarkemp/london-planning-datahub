    "The oaks are all situated within the front garden of 140B Vine Lane. They have a moderate to high collective amenity value and significantly contribute to the arboreal character and amenity of Hillingdon Court Park, Area of Special Local Character.",

    "Having regard to the reasons given for the proposed work, the work is unjustified and will have a detrimental impact on the visual amenity and arboreal character of the area.",
    "The removal of deadwood, dangerous / hanging branches and ivy:  This does not require the formal consent of the Council."
