    "The oaks are all situated within the front garden of 140B Vine Lane. They have a moderate to high collective amenity value and significantly contribute to the arboreal character and amenity of Hillingdon Court Park, Area of Special Local Character.",
    "The applicant has ticked yes to both 4.1 dangerous condition of the tree, and 4.2 alleged damage to property however no technical evidence has been provided to support these claims. A reduction would unnecessarily introduce multiple wounds into the Oaks crowns, which would likely cause stress and lead to infection, affecting their long-term health; this would affect the safe useful life expectancy of the Oak trees. Pruning would also result in weakly attached re-growth forming that would be prone to future failure.",
    "Having regard to the reasons given for the proposed work, the work is unjustified and will have a detrimental impact on the visual amenity and arboreal character of the area.",
    "The removal of deadwood, dangerous / hanging branches and ivy:  This does not require the formal consent of the Council."
