    "The Lawson Cypress is situated within a raised brick planter in the front communal gardens of St John's Court. It was retained with several other mature trees when the site was re-developed in the 1970's. The tree is highly visible and is a conspicuous landscape feature, with a high amenity value.",
    "The Lawson Cypress (T7) is an attractive tree. Due to the current height of the tree reducing it in height by 2m would keep the canopy above the properties gutter line, as a result it is unlikely this work would increase light to the property. The proposed height and side reduction however would ruin the tree's appearance.",
    "Having regard to the reasons given for the proposed work, the work is unjustified and will have a detrimental impact on the visual amenity and arboreal character of the area.",
