    "The development is close to the aerodrome and the approach to the runway. The applicant is advised that there is a need to carefully design any lighting proposals. This is further explained in Advice Note 2, 'Lighting near Aerodromes' (available at www.aoa.org.uk/publications/safeguarding.asp). Please note that the Air Navigation Order 2005, Article 135 grants the Civil Aviation Authority power to serve notice to extinguish or screen lighting which may endanger aircraft."
