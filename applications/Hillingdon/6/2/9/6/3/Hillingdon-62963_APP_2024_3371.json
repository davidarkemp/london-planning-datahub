    "The proposed development, by reason of the demolition of a locally listed building and the replacement building's design, scale, and prominence, and proposed landscaping, including the removal of Conservation Area trees, would result in an uncharacteristic form of development that would fail to harmonise with the local character of the Conservation Area and harm designated and non-designated heritage assets whereby the public benefits would not outweigh the harm. The proposed development would have a detrimental impact on the area's character, appearance, and visual amenities. It is, thus, contrary to Chapters 12 and 16 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2024), Policies D3, HC1 and HC7 of the London Plan (2021), Policies HE1 and BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 (2012), and Policies DMHB 1, DMHB 2, DMHB 3, DMHB 4, DMHB 9, DMHB 11 and DMHB 14 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 (2020).",
    "The Applicant has not submitted sufficient evidence to justify the out-of-town centre location of retail floor space and has failed to demonstrate that the proposal would not have an unacceptable harmful impact upon the vitality and viability of town centres and local parades. The proposed development is, thus, contrary to Chapter 7 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2024), Policy SD7 of the London Plan (2021), Policy E5 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 (2012) and Policy DMTC 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 (2020).",
    "The planning application has failed to demonstrate through the submission of authoritative marketing evidence that there is no realistic prospect of the locally listed building (the Old Orchard Public House) being brought back into use as a public house in the foreseeable future. Therefore, the principle of the loss of the public house is unacceptable, contrary to Policy HC7 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "The proposed development would not adequately facilitate walking, cycling, or public transport and would include an oversupply of car parking. The Applicant has failed to submit a Parking Management and Design Plan to detail the car park's management, and the application has not demonstrated that the proposal would not increase road danger. Therefore, the proposed development contradicts Chapter 9 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2024) and Policies T1, T4, T6, and T6.3 of The London Plan (2021), Policies DMT 1, DMT 2, DMT 5, and DMT 6 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 (2020).",
    "The proposed development would result in an inappropriate net loss of biodiversity and an unacceptable loss of trees. The Applicant has not submitted sufficient details regarding the proposal's Urban Greening Factor and the development's potential impact on onsite roosting bats. The proposal is, therefore, contrary to Schedule 7A of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as inserted by Schedule 14 of the Environment Act 2021), Chapter 15 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2024), Policies GG2, D8, G5, G6, and G7 of The London Plan (2021), and Policies DMEI 7, DMHB 12, and DMHB 14 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 (2020).",
    "The proposed development would contribute to unacceptable pollutant emissions in the Ruislip Town Centre Focus Area. The proposed development would not be air quality neutral or air quality positive, and the measures proposed are insufficient to mitigate the total emissions. The Applicant has not agreed to the recommended pre-commencement air quality planning conditions. As such, the development is contrary to Paragraphs 187 and 199 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2024), Policy SI 1 of The London Plan (2021), Policy EM8 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 (2012), Policy DMEI 14 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 (2020), and the London Borough of Hillingdon Air Quality Local Action Plan 2019-2024.",
    "In the absence of a Section 106 Agreement, the Applicant has failed to mitigate the impacts posed by the proposed development (in respect of Air Quality, Employment, Energy Monitoring and Carbon Offsetting and Obligation Monitoring). The scheme therefore conflicts with Policy EM8 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 (2012), Policies DMCI 7, DMEI 14 and DMEI 2 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 (2020); the adopted Planning Obligations Supplementary Planning Document (2014); Policies DF1 and SI 1, SI 2 of the London Plan (2021); and paragraphs 56-58, 187 and 199 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2024)."
