    "The proposal seeks retrospective permission to convert a car workshop (Use Class B2) into a car showroom (Sui Gen Use Class). The proposed use does not fall within the list of appropriate uses for Strategic Industrial Locations, nor has it been proven that the development would comply with Policy DME1 (D) of the Local Plan, which sets out exceptional circumstances where alternate uses will be allowed within designated SIL's. The development would therefore lower the councils provision of designated industrial land without justification, subsequently to the detriment of the SIL, contrary to Policy DME 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 (2020) and Policies E4 and E5 of the London Plan (2021) and paragraphs 86 and 87 of the NPPF (2024)",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan (2021) and national guidance."
