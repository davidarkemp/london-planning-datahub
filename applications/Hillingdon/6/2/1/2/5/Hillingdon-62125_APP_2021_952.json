  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed three storey building, by reason of its size, scale, bulk, height and design and form would fail to respect the traditional appearance of the Old Northwood Area of Special Local Character. The modern block would be a starkly contrasting building, with its scale dominating the existing environment. The flat roof form, at the proposed height, is uncharacteristic of the Old Northwood Area of Special Local Character. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policies BE1 and HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 5, DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies, Policy HC1 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2019).",
    "The proposed development by reason of its, size, scale, bulk and siting, would be detrimental to the amenities of adjacent residential occupiers in the adjoining terrace at the rear of St Matthews Church and 1 to 6 St Matthews Court, by reason of overdominance, overshadowing, visual intrusion, loss of outlook, overlooking and loss of privacy. Therefore, the proposal would be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policy DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The proposed development, by virtue of its failure to provide amenity space of sufficient size and quality commensurate to the size and layout of Flats 3-6 would result in an over-development of the site detrimental to the residential amenity of future occupiers. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies DMHB 11 and DMHB 18 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "The proposed two bedroom flat on the ground floor, by reason of the siting of the ground floor flank windows, given their proximity to the parking space and narrow private amenity space, would result in the provision of a habitable room with limited levels of natural lighting and outlook that would result in a substandard form of living accommodation and reliance upon artificial means of lighting which would fail to satisfy sustainability and energy efficiency objectives and would be to the detriment of the amenity of future occupiers, contrary to Policy DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and Policies D6 and SI2 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "The proposal fails to provide step free access to the proposed dwellings above ground floor and it would not be accessible for wheelchair users and other persons unable to use a staircase to the detriment of the amenity of future occupiers. Therefore, the proposal is contrary to Policy DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy D7 of the London Plan 2021 and the Council's adopted Supplementary Planning Document HDAS: Accessible Hillingdon (September 2017).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan - The Spatial Development Strategy for London consolidated with alterations since 2011 (2016) and national guidance.",
