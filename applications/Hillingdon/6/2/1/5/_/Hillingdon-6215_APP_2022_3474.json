    "The proposed two-storey side extension and single storey front extension, by reason of its size, scale, bulk, siting, height and design (including the uncharacteristic roof design), would appear as a disproportionate and incongruous addition that would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original dwelling or the rhythm and pattern of development in the street. It would also be detrimental to the appearance of the host dwelling, the character, appearance and visual amenities of the area and would fail to neither preserve or enhance the character or appearance of the surrounding Ickenham Village Conservation Area. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies BE1 and HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012), Policies DMHB 1, DMHB 4, DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policies D1, D3, D4 and HC1 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021)."
