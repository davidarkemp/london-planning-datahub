  "description": "Installation of fascia signage and awnings",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The advertisements and awnings by reason of their number, overall size, scale, design, colour, and lettering results in a cluttered appearance that appear visually intrusive and out of keeping with signage in the locality. The sign is detrimental to the character and appearance of the existing and adjoining properties and the visual amenity of the street scene. As such, the proposal is contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11 and DMHB 13A of the  Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The decision to REFUSE Advertisement Consent has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE Advertisement Consent has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan - The Spatial Development Strategy for London consolidated with alterations since 2011 (2016) and national guidance.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "The Council has however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reason for refusal.",
    "It is noted that the application forms state that the adverts are not illuminated, however, there are external lights above the main fascia section. This would need to be clarified prior to any permission being granted in the future."
