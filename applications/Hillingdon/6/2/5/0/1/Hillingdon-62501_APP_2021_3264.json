    "The proposed extensions, in particular the first floor side/rear extension element coupled up with the existing large rear dormer, by virtue of its , combined height, depth, and in particularity width, bulk and massing including the the squat and boxy/flat crown roof, would result in a boxy, bulky, visually intrusive, disproportionate, incongruous, dominant and overbearing addition that would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original dwelling, relationship with the un extended semi-detached pair of no.91 Pinner Road, character and appearance of the the immediate stretch of properties along this part of Pinner Road and visual amenities of the streetscene. Therefore, the proposal would be contrary to Section 16 of the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF - 2021), Policies D1 and D4 of the London Plan (2021), Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012) and Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Pa",
