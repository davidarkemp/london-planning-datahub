    "The proposed extensions, in particular the first floor side/rear extension element coupled with the existing large rear dormer, by virtue of its combined height, depth, width, bulk and massing, would result in a boxy, bulky, visually intrusive, disproportionate, incongruous, dominant and overbearing addition that would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original dwelling, relationship with the un extended semi-detached pair of no.91 Pinner Road, character and appearance of the the immediate stretch of properties along this part of Pinner Road and visual amenities of the streetscene. Therefore, the proposal would be contrary to Section 16 of the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF - 2021), Policies D1 and D4 of the London Plan (2021), Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012) and Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2021). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020.",
    "The Applicant is advised that no rear patio has been considered as part of this proposal. Planning permission would likely be required for a raised patio/ terrace at ground floor level."
