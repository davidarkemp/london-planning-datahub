    "The proposed development fails to provide an adequate internal site roadway nor a sufficiently wide and safe access road into the site, to the detriment of highway and pedestrian safety on and adjacent to the site. The proposal is therefore unsafe and contrary to Local Plan: Part 2 Development Plan (2020) Policies DMT 1, DMT 2 and Policy T6 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "The proposed development by reason of its size, layout, siting, design and proximity to neighbouring boundaries would result in a cramped and contrived form of development which fails to respect the established pattern of development, detrimental to the character and appearance of the site and surrounding area, all contrary to Local Plan Policies BE1 and DMHB11, London Plan Policies D1, D3 and D4 as well as the NPPF in relation to good quality, contextual design.",
    "The proposed dwellings, by reason of their design and layout fail to meet the requirements of people with disabilities and would therefore give rise to a substandard form of living accommodation to the detriment of the amenity of future occupiers. The proposal is thus contrary to Policy D7 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal.",
    "This is a reminder that Under the terms of the Planning Act 2008 (as amended) and Community Infrastructure Levy Regulations 2010 (as amended), should an application for appeal be allowed, the proposed development would be deemed as 'chargeable development' and therefore liable to pay the London Borough of Hillingdon Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and the Mayor of London's Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This would be calculated in accordance with the London Borough of Hillingdon CIL Charging Schedule 2014 and the Mayor of London's CIL Charging Schedule 2012.",
