    "The proposed development, by reason of its backland location, size, scale, massing, height and design (including the incorporation of a side gable roof profile and front and rear dormers) would result in a bulky, visually obtrusive and incongruous form of development. The proposal would therefore cause significant harm to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the street scene and the setting of the Ruislip, Many Way Conservation Area. The proposal therefore conflicts with Policies BE1 and HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One- Strategic Policies (2012) and Policies DMHB 1, DMHB 4, DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020), Policies HC1, D1, D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The proposed development, by virtue of siting, size, scale, bulk, height and design (including the incorporation of a side gable roof profile and front and rear dormers) would cause harm to the living conditions of the neighbouring residential occupiers, in terms of loss of outlook and overbearing impact, at numbers 83/83A to 89/89A Manor Way, the first floor flats at numbers 93 and 95A Manor Way, numbers 40, 40A, 40B and 40C Windmill Hill and numbers 12, 12A, 14, 14A Priory Close. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One- Strategic Policies (2012), Policy DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The proposed dwelling, by virtue of the inadequate floorspace of Bedroom 4, would provide future occupiers of this room with a substandard form of internal residential accommodation. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy and DMHB 16 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "a) We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal.",
    "This is a reminder that Under the terms of the Planning Act 2008 (as amended) and Community Infrastructure Levy Regulations 2010 (as amended), should an application for appeal be allowed, the proposed development would be deemed as 'chargeable development' and therefore liable to pay the London Borough of Hillingdon Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and the Mayor of London's Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This would be calculated in accordance with the London Borough of Hillingdon CIL Charging Schedule 2014 and the Mayor of London's CIL Charging Schedule 2012.",
