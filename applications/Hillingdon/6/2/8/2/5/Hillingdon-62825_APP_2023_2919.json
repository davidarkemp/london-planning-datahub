    "The proposal extensions by reason of their combined and excessive footprint, scale, bulk, width and overall size, and inconsistent design (including roof pitch and form), would result in an over development of the site which would fail to read as a subordinate to the host property, harming the original design and appearance of the host property and detrimental to the character and visual amenity of the area including the adjacent Coppermill Lock Conservation Area and Listed building. Therefore, the proposal fails to comply with Paragraphs 130b) and 134 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021), Policies HE1 and BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One Strategic Policies (2012) and Policies DMHB 1, DMHB 2, DMHB 4, DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2021). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service. We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
