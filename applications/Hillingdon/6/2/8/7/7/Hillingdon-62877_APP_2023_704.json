    "The proposed first floor side and rear extensions to the dwelling, by reason of its size, scale, bulk and design, would appear as an insubordinate and visually incongruous form of development that would be harmful to the character and appearance of the dwellinghouse and the visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area. The proposal, therefore, conflicts, with Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - 1 Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local plan - Part Two (2020) and Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021) and Chapter 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2021). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020."
