    "The proposed hip to gable and rear dormer window extension, in conjunction with the existing two storey side addition, would fail to read as subordinate to the main house, resulting in an overly dominant, bulky and harmful roof form at the property, failing to respect the architectural integrity of the main house. The development proposal therefore conflicts with Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan (2012), Policies DMHB 5, DMHB 11 , DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service."
