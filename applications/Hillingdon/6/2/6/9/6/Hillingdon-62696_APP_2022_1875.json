    "The proposed development, by reason of the size, scale, bulk, width and design would result in a cramped form of development which would fail to read as subordinate to the main house and fail to respond to the established character and context of Cedars Drive. The proposal would, thus, result in an over dominant and visually obtrusive form of development, to the detriment of the visual amenities of the street scene. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020)."
