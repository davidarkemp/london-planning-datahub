  "description": "Two storey side extension, part two storey, part single storey rear extension, porch to front and addition of 2 rooflights",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed two storey side extension, by virtue of its siting, size, scale and design, including the lack of a set back from the front at all levels and lack of a set down of the ridge from the main ridge of the roof, would fail to appear as a subordinate addition and would thus be detrimental to the appearance of the original house, would be detrimental to the character, appearance and symmetry of the pair of semi-detached houses of which it forms a part and to the visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "The proposed two-storey rear extensions by reason of its size, scale, bulk, height, width, depth and massing in this open prominent position, would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original dwelling, would be detrimental to the character, appearance and symmetry of the pair of semi-detached houses of which it forms a part and to the visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "The proposed two storey side/rear extension, by reason of its size, scale, bulk and proximity to the side boundary, would result in a closing of a visually open gap between it and the neighbouring property, giving rise to a cramped form of development which would be detrimental to the visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area generally. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2016). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020."
