    "The proposed two-storey side extension, by virtue of its siting, combined height, width and depth, gabled roof form and lack of set in from the common boundaries with the Brackenbridge Drive properties would result in an excessive, visually intrusive, disproportionate, incongruous, dominant and bulky addition that would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original dwelling, loss of an important established gap between buildings, negatively impact the relation with the attached pair, detrimental to the character and appearance of the neighbouring buildings of which it forms a part to and the visual amenities of the street scene. Therefore, the proposal would be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012) and Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021) and Section 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework (N",
    "The proposed two-storey side extension alongside the single storey side/rear extension, by virtue of its proximity, close siting, combined height, width and depth would result in substantial harm to the occupiers of no.30 Down Barns Road and nos.22 and 24 Brackenbridge Drive in terms of overdominance, outlook, sense of enclosure, visual intrusion, overbearing impact and some loss of daylight/sunlight. Therefore, the proposal would be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012) and Policies DMHD 1, DMHB 11 and DMHB 12  of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
