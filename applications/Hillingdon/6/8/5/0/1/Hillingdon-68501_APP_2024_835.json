    "The proposed extensions by reason of their size, bulk, design and scale, would cumulatively result in a bulky and visually incongruous form of development that would be detrimental to the character and appearance of the original property and surrounding area. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2021), Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management (2020), Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021) and Chapter 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023).",
    "The proposed development, due to the proximity of windows at 52A/52B Station Approach and the proposed new flank windows at first floor level facing onto this neighbouring property would result unacceptable overlooking. The build up of the flank wall and roof along this elevation would also lead to a loos of outlook and light to these adjoining neighbours. As such it would lead to an unacceptable impact on the neighbouring property by virtue of loss of light, loss of outlook and loss of privacy.  The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012), Policy DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2023).",
    "The proposed development, by virtue of the poor overall layout of the first flat (Flat 2) including the reliance of side facing window (serving bedroom 1) would lead to substandard outlook and in  the absence of a BRE daylight and sunlight assessment, the application has failed to demonstrate that the proposed development would have adequate levels of sunlight and daylight. Therefore, it would result in an unsatisfactory quality of internal residential accommodation for the future occupants of the Flat 2.  The proposal would therefore result in a substandard form of internal residential accommodation to the detriment of the amenity of the future occupiers of the proposed development, contrary to Policy DMHB 16 of the  Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2023).",
    "The proposed development, by virtue of its failure to provide private amenity space provision for Flat 2 would be detrimental to the external living conditions of future occupiers of the proposed Flat 2. The proposal would therefore conflict with Policy DMHB 18 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2023).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "a) We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the amendments required to make the application acceptable are substantial and would materially change the development proposal. They would require further consultation to be undertaken prior to determination which could not take place within the statutory determination period specified by the Department of Communities and Local Government. You are therefore encouraged to consider the submission of a fresh application incorporating the material amendments set out below w"
