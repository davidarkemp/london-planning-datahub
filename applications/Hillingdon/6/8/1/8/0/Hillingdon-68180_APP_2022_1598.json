    "Due its irregular plot and siting, overall design and size the proposed dwelling would form an uncharacteristic and incongruous addition to the area, which would fail to integrate with the Press Road Street scene and the smaller scale of other garden development in the area. The proposal would therefore be detrimental to the visual amenity and character of the surrounding area,  contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies, Policies DMH 6, DMHB 5, DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHB 18 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policies D1, D3 and D6 of the London Plan (2021), as well as paragraphs 71, 124 and 130 of the NPPF (2021).",
    "Due to its height, bulk and close proximity to No.18 and No.19 Mead Road, the proposed dwelling would be detrimental to the amenities of those neighbours by reason of visual intrusion, sense of enclosure and loss of outlook. It is therefore considered that the proposal would be contrary to Policies DMH 6 and DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies.",
    "The external amenity space of the new dwelling would be severely overlooked by No.18 and No.19 Mead Road, discouraging use of the space and harming the amenities of its future occupiers. Furthermore the bedroom within the proposed dwelling would be provided with inadequate and poor levels of outlook and light. The proposal is therefore considered to be provide poor quality external and internal accommodation for its future occupiers, contrary to requirements of Policy D6 (D) of the London Plan (2021) and paragraph 130 (f) of the NPPF (2021).",
    "No legal agreement is in place to prohibit future residents of the proposed development from applying to join the Councils on street parking management scheme. In the absence of such an agreement the Councils Parking Management Scheme is likely to be overrun, leading to roadside parking, congestion and reduced highway safety. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policy DMT 2 of the Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020) and T4 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan and national guidance.",
    "This is a reminder that Under the terms of the Planning Act 2008 (as amended) and Community Infrastructure Levy Regulations 2010 (as amended), should an application for appeal be allowed, the proposed development would be deemed as 'chargeable development' and therefore liable to pay the London Borough of Hillingdon Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and the Mayor of London's Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This would be calculated in accordance with the London Borough of Hillingdon CIL Charging Schedule 2014 and the Mayor of London's CIL Charging Schedule 2012.",
