    "The new access will need to be constructed to an appropriate Council standard under a S278 (Highways Act 1980) agreement (or suitable alternative arrangement) at the applicant's expense. The same would apply to the potential adjustment of the existing bus stop outside the property frontage which would require repositioning to facilitate unimpeded entry through the new crossing point.",
    "Under the terms of the Planning Act 2008 (as amended) and Community Infrastructure Levy Regulations 2010 (as amended), this development is liable to pay the London Borough of Hillingdon Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and the Mayor of London's Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL).

Failure to submit a valid Assumption of Liability Notice and Commencement Notice prior to commencement of the development may result in su",
    "Given the nature of the proposed development it is possible that a crane may be required during its construction.  The applicant's attention is drawn to the requirement within the British Standard Code of Practice for the safe use of Cranes, for crane operators to consult the aerodrome before erecting a crane in close proximity to an aerodrome.  This is explained further in Advice Note 4, 'Cranes and Other Construction Issues' (available at www.aoa.org.uk/publications/safeguarding.asp)",
    "The applicant is advised that any flat/shallow pitched or green roof on buildings have the potential to attract gulls for nesting, roosting and loafing and loafing purposes. The owners/occupiers of the building must ensure that all flat/shallow pitched roofs be constructed to allow access to all areas by foot using permanent fixed access stairs ladders or similar.",
    "The owner/occupier must not allow gulls, to nest, roost or loaf on the building. Checks must be made weekly or sooner if bird activity dictates, during the breeding season. Outside of the breeding season gull activity must be monitored and the roof checked regularly to ensure that gulls do not utilise the roof.  Any gulls found nesting, roosting or loafing must be dispersed by the owner/occupier when detected or when requested by BAA Airside Operations staff. In some instances it may be necessary to contact BAA Airside Operations staff before bird dispersal takes place. The contact would be Gary Hudson, The Development Assu",
    "The development requires the formation of a vehicular crossover, which will be constructed by the Council.  This work is also subject to the issuing of a separate licence to obstruct or open up the public highway.

    "You are advised that care should be taken during the building works hereby approved to avoid spillage of mud, soil or related building materials onto the pavement or public highway. You are further advised that failure to take appropriate steps to avoid spillage or adequately clear it away could result in action being taken under the Highways Act 1980.",
    "You should ensure that your premises do not generate litter in the streets and nearby areas.  Sections 93 and 94 of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 give local authorities the power to serve 'Street Litter Control Notices' requiring businesses to clear up the litter and implement measures to prevent the land from becoming littered again.  By imposing a 'Street Litter Control Notice', the local authority has the power to force businesses to clean up the area in the vicinity of their premises, provide and empty bins and do anything else which may be necessary to remove litter.  Amendments made to the 1990 Act by the Clean Neighbourhoods and Environment Act 2005 have made it immediately an offence to fail to comply with the requirements of a Street Litter Control Notice, and fixed penalties may be issued as an alternative to prosecution.",
