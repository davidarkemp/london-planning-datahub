    "The proposed plans indicate amendments which includes the installation of new rooflights, one of which could potentially be harmful on the residential amenity of the neighbour No.2 Greystoke Drive. These proposed works would conflict with Condition 5 of the original permission which specifies that no additional windows, doors or other openings shall be constructed in the walls or roof slopes. The changes would therefore not represent a non material change to the original planning permission, and the application is refused."
