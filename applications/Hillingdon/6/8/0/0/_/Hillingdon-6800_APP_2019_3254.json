  "description": "Part five storey, part four storey, part three storey detached building to provide 8 x 1-bed and 1 x 2-bed self contained flats involving demolition of existing dwelling",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed development, by reason of its scale, height, mass, siting and design, situated in a visually prominent position, would result in a visually intrusive form of development, which would fail to harmonise with the existing local and historic context of the surrounding area. As such the proposal would have a detrimental impact on the character, appearance and visual amenities of this existing open area of the street scene and the residential area as a whole. The proposal is thus contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies BE13 and BE19 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Saved UDP Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the emerging Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies with Modifications (March 2019), Policy 7.4 of the London Plan, the Council's adopted Supplementary Planning Document HDAS: Residential Layouts and the NPPF.",
    "The proposed development, by virtue of its siting, size, scale, bulk and proximity, would be detrimental to the amenities of the adjoining occupiers at 57 and 59 Horton Road and 1 - 3 Colham Avenue, by reason of visual intrusion, overdominance and loss of outlook. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policies BE19 and BE21 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Saved UDP Policies (November 2012), Policy DMHB 11 of the emerging Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies with Modifications (March 2019) and the Council's adopted Supplementary Planning Document HDAS: Residential Layouts.",
    "The proposed development, by virtue of the provision of a raised terrace would be detrimental to the amenities of the adjoining occupiers at 1 - 3 Colham Avenue, by reason of loss of privacy. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policy BE24 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Saved UDP Policies (November 2012), Policy DMHB 11 of the emerging Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies with Modifications (March 2019) and the Council's adopted Supplementary Planning Document HDAS: Residential Layouts.",
    "The proposal has not demonstrated that sufficient off street parking/manoeuvring arrangements would be provided, and therefore the development is considered to result in substandard car parking provision, leading to on-street parking/queuing to the detriment of public and highway safety and contrary to Policies AM7 and AM14 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Unitary Development Plan Saved Policies (November 2012), Policies DMT 2 and DMT 6 of the emerging Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies with Modifications (March 2019), to Hillingdon's Adopted Parking Standards as set out in the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Unitary Development Plan Saved Policies (November 2012) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document HDAS: Residential Layouts.",
    "The proposed development, by virtue of its failure to provide usable quality amenity space would result in an over-development of the site detrimental to the residential amenity of future occupiers. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies BE19 and BE23 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Unitary Development Plan Saved Policies (November 2012), Policy DMHB 18 of the emerging Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies with Modifications (March 2019) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document HDAS: Residential Layouts.",
    "The proposal fails to demonstrate compliance with the technical specification within Approved Document M to the Building Regulations (2015 edition) and as such the proposal fails to comply with the requirements of Policy 3.8(c) of the London Plan (March 2016).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant saved policies (referred to as policies from the Hillingdon Unitary Development Plan - Saved Policies September 2007), then London Plan Policies (2016).  On the 8th November 2012 Hillingdon's Full Council agreed the adoption of the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies. Appendix 5 of this explains which saved policies from the old Unitary Development (which was subject to a direction from Secretary of State in September 2007 agreeing that the policies were 'saved') still apply for development control decisions.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the 'Saved' UDP 2007, Local Plan Part 1, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service."
