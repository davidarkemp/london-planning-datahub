    "The proposed outbuilding, by reason of its excessive scale, bulk, and subsequent massing would result in an overly dominant and visually obtrusive form of development which fails to preserve or enhance the character and appearance of the Cowley Lock Conservation Area. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies BE1 and HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 4 and DMHD 2 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - (2020), Policy HC1 of the London Plan (2021) and the NPPF (2023).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
