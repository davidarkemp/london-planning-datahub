    "Prior to the first operation of the development, a Delivery, Servicing and Waste Management Plan shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority. This should demonstrate that arrival and departure of HGVs shall not take place at the same time to avoid conflict and highway safety issues. This should accord with Transport for London's Delivery and Servicing Plan Guidance.",
    "Thereafter the development shall be operated in full accordance with the approved details.",
    "REASON",
    "To ensure appropriate servicing of the site, to safeguard highway safety and to safeguard the free flow of traffic, in accordance with Policies DMT 1 and DMT 2 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 (2020) and Policy T7 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "Trees, hedges and shrubs shown to be retained on the approved plans shall not be damaged, uprooted, felled, lopped or topped without the prior written consent of the Local Planning Authority. If any retained tree, hedge or shrub is removed or severely damaged during construction, or is found to be seriously diseased or dying another tree, hedge or shrub shall be planted at the same place or, if planting in the same place would leave the new tree, hedge or shrub susceptible to disease, then the planting should be in a position to be first agreed in writing with the Local Planning Authority and shall be of a size and species to be agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority and shall be planted in the first planting season following the completion of the development or the occupation of the buildings, whichever is the earlier. Where damage is less severe, a schedule of remedial works necessary to ameliorate the effect of damage by tree surgery, feeding or groundwork shall be agreed",
    "No contaminated soils or other materials shall be imported to the site. All imported soils for landscaping purposes shall be clean and free of contamination. All imported soils shall be tested for chemical contamination, and the results of this testing shall be interpreted and submitted, in report form, for written approval by the Local Planning Authority.",
    "REASON",
    "To ensure that risks from land contamination to the future users of the land and neighbouring land are minimised, together with those to controlled waters, property and ecological systems and the development can be carried out safely without unacceptable risks to workers, neighbours and other offsite receptors in accordance with Policies DMEI 11 and DMEI 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 (2020).",
