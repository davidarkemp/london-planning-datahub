    "The Oak is situated within the front garden/driveway of 138 Northwood Road. This tree appears in gradual decline but still holds vitality, and represents an important landscape feature, contributing to the arboreal character of the local area and offering habitat to a wide array of species.",
    "The applicant states that the majority of the crown is dead, but evidence suggests that most of the crown is still green and bearing leaf buds. No arboricultural assessment has been provided underlining the presence of unhealed cavities within the tree, nor picus or resistrograph tests have been shown to corroborate this statement. In relation to the presence of deadwood in the crown, the removal of this is exempt from the application process and can be undertaken without the need for the Council's consent.",
    "The proposed work to remove this Oak will substantially affect the aesthetics and visual amenity of the area, as well as remove an important wildlife habitat.",
    "Having regard to the reasons given",
    "The removal of deadwood, dangerous / hanging branches and ivy:  This does not require the formal consent of the Council.",
    "Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981:  Note that it is an offence under this act to disturb roosting bats, nesting birds or any other protected species."
