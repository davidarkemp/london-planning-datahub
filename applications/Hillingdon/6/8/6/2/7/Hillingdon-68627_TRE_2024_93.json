    "The Oak is located in the front garden/driveway of 138 Northwood Road. Although it shows signs of gradual decline, it still retains vitality and serves as a significant landscape feature, and as such has a high amenity value. This tree contributes to the arboreal character of the local area and provides habitat for a diverse range of species.",
    "The proposed work would introduce multiple unnecessary wounds to the tree's crown, likely causing stress and leading to infection. Given that the tree is already in gradual decline, introducing multiple major pruning cuts at this stage would not be advisable. Removing any dead wood would address immediate safety concerns without further compromising the tree's health.",

    "Pockets of decay and bore holes are not valid reasons for an overall reduction. It is normal for mature oaks to exhibit some degree of these characteristics, which do not inherently warrant a",

Therefore, if applicable, it is advisable to consult your tree surgeon / consultant to agree an acceptable time for carrying out the approved works.",
    "Owner(s)'s permission:  Permission should be sought from the owner(s) of the tree(s) and / or the owner(s) of the land that the tree(s) overhang prior to any approved work being carried out.",
    "Expected standard of tree work: The approved works must be carried out in accordance with the conditions laid out above. If they are not, then enforcement action could being taken which could lead to prosecution and heavy fines. Therefore, it is highly recommended that the works are only carried out by a professional and competent arboriculturist who undertakes to comply with the conditions of this consent and in accordance with industry best practice (BS 3998:2010). The Arboricultural Association can provide details of its approved contractors, who have demonstrated such professionalism and competence, on their website (www.trees.org.uk) or by calling 01242 522152. Or on request the Council can provide a list of contractors who are known to carry out tree work to a good standard and to normally maintain an appropriate policy of indemnity insurance."
