  "description": "Single storey rear/side extension",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed single storey side/rear extension, by reason of its siting, excessive width, size, scale, bulk and proximity to the side boundary, would result in harm to the design of the original dwelling and the street scene. The proposal would therefore represent an overdevelopment of the site to the detriment of the visual amenities of the street scene and the character and appearance of the surrounding area. The proposed development is therefore contrary to Policies DMHB11 and  DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "The proposed single storey rear/side extension, by reason of its excessive height and proximity, would result in an overly dominant feature to the adjoining property at No. 9 Repens Way, and as such would result in a visually intrusive and an un-neighbourly form of development, resulting in a material loss of residential amenity. Therefore the proposal would conflict with Policies DMHB11 and DMHD1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020)', Local Plan Part 1, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
