    "By virtue of the cumulative impact of the existing extensions and the size, width, bulk and massing of the proposed rear extensions, the proposal would appear as an insubordinate and incongruous form of development that would fail to respect the architectural composition of the host dwelling and would fail to preserve or enhance the character and appearance of the conservation area. The proposal would therefore conflict with Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One Strategic Policies (2012) and Policies DMHB 4, DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The proposed development, by reason of its proximity, siting, scale, height and roof form, would impact on the residential amenities of the existing neighbouring occupiers at No.43 Long Lane, by reason of overdominance, loss of outlook, sense of enclosure, visual intrusion, loss of daylight/sunlight and overbearing impact. The proposal would therefore conflict with Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service. We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
