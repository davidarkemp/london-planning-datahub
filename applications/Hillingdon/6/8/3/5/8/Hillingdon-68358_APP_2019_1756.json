    "The proposed extension to the existing outbuilding, by reason of its siting, size, scale and bulk, would create a structure which would be detrimental to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the adjoining occupiers by reason of overdominance and visual intrusion. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies BE19 and BE21 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Saved UDP Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 2 of the emerging Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies with Modifications (March 2019) and the Council's adopted Supplementary Planning Document HDAS: Residential Extensions.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the 'Saved' UDP 2007, Local Plan Part 1, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service. We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
