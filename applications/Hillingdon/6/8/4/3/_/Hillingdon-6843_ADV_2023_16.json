    "The proposed advertisement by reason of its size, siting, design, prominent position, height above ground and method of display, would have a very significant harmful impact on the visual amenities of the surrounding area in general and the host building in particular, creating advertising clutter where none exists at present and degrading the visual quality of the urban environment. The proposal is therefore contrary to the Council's adopted policies, in particular Policies HE1 and BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 13 and DMHB 13A of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",

We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
