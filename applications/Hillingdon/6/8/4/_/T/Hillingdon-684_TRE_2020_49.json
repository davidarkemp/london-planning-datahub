    "The Douglas Fir is situated within the rear garden of 36 Court Road and can be seen from the main road above the properties. As a result it has a Moderate amenity value and contributes to the arboreal character of Ickenham Village Conservation Area.",
    "A reduction in height by as much as 1/3rd will bring the tree's crown below the height of the roof and therefore drastically reduce it's amenity value. The applicant mentions the tree has been previously pollarded but there is no record of a TPO application for this and a Douglas fir is not a typical species to pollard. No evidence has been provided that the fork is weak only that there is the potential for weakness.",
    "Having regard to the reasons given for the proposed work, the work is unjustified and will have a detrimental impact on the visual amenity and arboreal character of the area.",
    "The removal of deadwood, dangerous / hanging branches and ivy:  This does not require the formal consent of the Council."
