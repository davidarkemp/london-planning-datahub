    "The outbuilding, by reason of its size, scale and bulk, represents a large and conspicuous addition which is out of keeping with the prevailing character of the area and fails to appear subordinate and proportionate to the footprint of the dwellinghouse and to the residential curtilage in which it stands. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies DMHD 2 and DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The proposal is for a detached structure which, by reason of its size, scale and layout is considered capable of independent occupation from the main dwelling and is thus tantamount to a separate dwelling in a position where such a dwelling would not be acceptable as it could result in an unacceptable impact on adjoining occupiers and additional requirements for parking and amenity space. The proposal is therefore contrary to policies DMHD2, DMHB 11, DMHB 18 and DMT 6 of the London Borough of Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two-Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2016). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020."
