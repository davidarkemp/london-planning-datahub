    "The proposed single storey side/ rear extension, by virtue of its siting, size, scale, bulk, excessive depth and proximity, would be detrimental to the residential amenities of the adjoining occupiers at 50 Ryeland Close by reason of overdominance, overshadowing, visual intrusion, loss of light and loss of outlook. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "The proposed extension, by virtue of its failure to maintain an adequate amount of private usable external amenity space for the occupiers of the existing property, would result in over-development of the site detrimental to the residential amenity of existing and future occupiers. The proposal is therefore contrary to policies DMHB 11, DMHB 18 and DMHD1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "The proposal, by reason of the siting of the ground floor flank living room/kitchen windows, given their proximity to the side boundary would result in the provision of a habitable room with very  limited levels of outlook and natural light that would result in a substandard form of living accommodation and reliance upon artificial means of lighting which would fail to satisfy sustainability and energy efficiency objectives and would be to the detriment of the amenity of future occupiers, contrary to Policy DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020) and Policies 3.5 and 5.3 of the London Plan (March 2016)",
    "The proposed development by reason of the side facing living room window and its proximity to the pedestrian pathway would result in a form of development which would not provide satisfactory amenities for the occupants of the host dwelling due to the loss of privacy that would arise.As such the proposal is considered to be in conflict with policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2016). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the 'Saved' UDP 2007, Local Plan Part 1, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service. This is a resubmission of a previously refused scheme, where the Officers Report identified issues to be addressed, which were reflected in the reasons for refusal, allowing the opportunity to address those issues within this submission."
