  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed extension, by virtue of its size, scale, bulk and proximity, would be detrimental to the amenities of the adjoining occupier at 1 Drayton Gardens, by reason of overdominance and overlooking. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The proposed extension, by virtue of its failure to maintain an adequate amount of private usable external amenity space for the occupiers of the existing property, would result in over-development of the site detrimental to the residential amenity of existing and future occupiers. The proposal is therefore contrary to DMHD 1 and DMHB 18 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2: Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. The Council's supports pre-application discussions. We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
