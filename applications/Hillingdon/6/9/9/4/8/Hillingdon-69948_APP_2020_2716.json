  "decision_conditions": [
    "The front extension, by reason of its siting, size, scale, bulk, design and cumulative width, represents an unduly incongruous form of development, which fails to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original semi-detached dwelling, is detrimental to the character, appearance and symmetry of the pair of semi-detached houses of which it forms a part and to the visual amenities of the street scene and the wider Barnhill Estate Area of Special Local Character. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies DMHB 1, DMHB 5, DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), Policy 7.8 of the London Plan (2016) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2019).",
