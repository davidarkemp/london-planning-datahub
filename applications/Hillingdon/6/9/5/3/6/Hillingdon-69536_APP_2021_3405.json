    "Due to its siting, bulk, scale, and site coverage, the proposed dwelling would form an oversized, uncharacteristic and visually incongruous form of development which would fail to harmonise with the established character of the area or the appearance of the street scene. The proposal would  therefore be detrimental to the visual amenities of the streetscene and character of the surrounding area, contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies, Policies DMH 6, DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policies D1 and D3 of the London Plan (2021), as well as paragraphs 124 and 130 of the NPPF (2021).",
    "Due to its height and location the proposed dwelling would provide overlooking views into the rear conservatory and garden of No.79 Hercies Road, subsequently causing a loss of privacy and harming the amenities of it occupiers. For the same reasons the proposal would provide harmful overlooking views into the rear garden of No.73, causing a loss of privacy and harming the amenities of its occupiers. Furthermore, the proposed dwelling would adversely impact upon the amenities of the adjacent buildings to the east of the site, which appear to be in residential use, by virtue of the design and proximity of the development and the resulting loss of outlook and privacy. The proposal is therefore considered to be contrary to policies DMHB 11 of the Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020) and paragraph 130 (f) of the NPPF (2021).",
