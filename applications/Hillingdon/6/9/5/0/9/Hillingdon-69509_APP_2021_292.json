    "The proposal, by reason of its excessive width and crown roof design, would fail to appear as a subordinate addition and would be detrimental to the appearance of the original house and wider area. The proposal would therefore be detrimental to the visual amenities of the street scene and harmful to the character and appearance of the wider area. The proposal is therefore contrary to policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1, of the Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",

In addition further guidance was offered to the applicant by the case officer during the processing of the application to identify the amendments to address those elements of the scheme considered unacceptable which the applicant chose not to implement"
