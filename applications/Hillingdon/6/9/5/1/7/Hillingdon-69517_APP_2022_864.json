    "The proposed extensions and roof works including the creation of the crown roof and terracing effect, by reason of the siting, uncharacteristic roof transition, combined height, width and depth including design would result in a dominant, disproportionate, incongruous and visually intrusive form of cramped and contrived overdevelopment that would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original dwelling, would negatively impact the relationship with the adjacent and nearby similar styled properties along Hillside Rise of which it forms a part, character and appearance of the Hillside, Northwood Hills Area of Special Local Character and the visual amenities of the streetscene and surrounding area. Therefore, the proposal would be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012), Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021), Policies DMHB 5, DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Poli",
    "The proposed single storey rear extension (in connection with the roof expansion) including the raising of the rear land levels and creation of patio would result in substantial harm to the occupiers of no.1 Hillside Rise in terms of overdominance, loss of outlook, visual intrusion, overbearing impact, overlooking/loss of privacy and some loss of daylight/sunlight. Therefore, the proposal would be contrary to Policies DMHD 1, DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The applicant has not submitted a Flood Risk Assessment and the application has failed to address the issues relating to flood risk and the proposal is therefore contrary to Policy SI12 of the London Plan (2021), Policy EM6 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012), Policy DMEI 9 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",

Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020."
