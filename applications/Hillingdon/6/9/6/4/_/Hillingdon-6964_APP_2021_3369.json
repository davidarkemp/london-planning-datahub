    "The proposed development, by reason of the small size of the rear habitable room window and its proximity to the rear boundary would result in poor outlook from and limited levels of natural lighting to the proposed study. Consequently substandard living accommodation would be provided to prospective occupants and the reliance upon artificial means of lighting would fail to satisfy sustainability and energy efficiency objectives. The proposal is therefore  contrary to policies  DMHB11 and  DMHB16 of the Hillingdon Local Plan - Part Two (November 2020) and Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "The proposed development fails to provide an access to the dwelling of sufficient width, thereby precluding satisfactory access for service/emergency vehicles, pedestrians and cyclists. As such the proposal is considered detrimental to pedestrian and highway safety, contrary to policies DMT 1, DMT2 and DMT 6 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020) and Policies T6 and T6.1 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "The lengthy and enclosed site access would fail to provide a safe, accessible and convenient route to the dwelling to the detriment of future residents and visitors, contrary to policies DMT 6, DMH6 and DMHB15 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 and Policy D11 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "The proposed illuminated site access for motorcyclists and pedestrians between two dwellings would cause harm to the residential amenity of Nos. 32 and 34 Star Road through  a loss of privacy, noise disturbance and light nuisance. The development is therefore contrary to policies DMH6 and DMHB11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan - Part Two (2020).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan (2021) and the NPPF (2021).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
