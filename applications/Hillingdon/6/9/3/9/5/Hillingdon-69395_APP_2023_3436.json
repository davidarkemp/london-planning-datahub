    "Due to its location, design, mass and scale the proposed development would form an uncharacteristic and visually incongruous development which would fail to harmonise with the local character and appearance of the surrounding area.

    "Due to the close proximity of the of the proposed development to the neighbouring properties no's 56A, 58A, 60A and 60B Station Road, the development would cause    loss of light, overshadowing, and be excessively overbearing to the occupiers of these properties to the detriment of the neighbours amenities and living conditions. The proposal is therefore considered to be contrary to Policies DMHB 11, of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021), and paragraph 135 (f) of the NPPF (2023).",
    "The proposed development fails to provide any private outdoor amenity space. As such the future occupiers of the property would be subjected to a poor standard of living accommodation to the detriment of their amenities. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policy DMHB 18 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and paragraph 135 (f) of the NPPF (2023).",
