C0, Covering Letter dated November 2020 and details relating to metal railings dated in email dated 18-01-21 and shall thereafter be retained/maintained for as long as the development remains in existence.",
    "REASON",
    "To ensure the development complies with the provisions Hillingdon Local: Plan Part 1 (November 2012) and Local Plan: Part 2 (January 2020) and the London Plan (2016).",
    "Trees, hedges and shrubs shown to be retained on the approved plan shall not be damaged, uprooted, felled, lopped or topped without the prior written consent of the Local Planning Authority. If any retained tree, hedge or shrub is removed or severely damaged during construction, or is found to be seriously diseased or dying another tree, hedge or shrub shall be planted at the same place or, if planting in the same place would leave the new tree, hedge or shrub susceptible to disease, then the planting should be in a position to be first agreed in writing with the Local Planning Authority and shall be of a size and species to be agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority and shall be planted in the first planting season following the completion of the development or the occupation of the buildings, whichever is the earlier. Where damage is less severe, a schedule of remedial works necessary to ameliorate the effect of damage by tree surgery, feeding or groundwork shall be agreed",
    "The Tree Protection Works hereby approved (Plan no: 6445-ACC-00-ZZ-DR-A-1011 Rev. C0) shall remain in place until the development approved under planning ref: 69346/APP/2020/1294 (20-07-20) and 69346/APP/2020/3717 is completed.",
    "REASON",

    "Prior to the relevant part of the works, a landscape scheme shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority. The scheme shall include: -",

    "Prior to the installation of the platform lift, details of the type and model of platform lift to be installed, including details of the emergency communication devices and uninterrupted power supply to be installed and provisions to ensure adequate means of escape of older and disabled people in the event of an emergency shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority. Thereafter the development shall be carried out and maintained in full accordance with the approved details.",
    "REASON",
    "To ensure the development provides an inclusive environment in accordance with Policies 3.1 and 7.2 of the London Plan (2016).",
    "The rating level of the noise emitted from the site shall be at least 5dB below the existing background noise level.  The noise levels shall be determined at the boundary adjoining Constabulary Place. The measurements and assessment shall be made in accordance to the latest British Standard 4142, 'Method for rating industrial noise affecting mixed residential and industrial areas'.",

    "To safeguard the amenity of the surrounding area in accordance with policy EM8 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012).",
    "The decision to GRANT planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to GRANT planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan - The Spatial Development Strategy for London consolidated with alterations since 2011 (2016) and national guidance.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably.",
    "The Equality Act 2010 seeks to protect people accessing goods, facilities and services from discrimination on the basis of a 'protected characteristic', which includes those with a disability. As part of the Act, service providers are obliged to improve access to and within the structure of their building, particularly in situations where reasonable adjustment can be incorporated with relative ease. The Act states that service providers should think ahead to take steps to address barriers that impede disabled people."
