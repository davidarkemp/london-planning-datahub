    "The proposed single storey rear extension would result in additions to the dwelling that due to their cumulative size and scale would be excessive and disproportionate to the original dwelling and would not appear as subordinate additions. The proposal would therefore be detrimental to the character and appearance of the original dwelling, contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One Strategic (2012) and Policies DMDH 1, DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
