  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed development by reason of its size, scale, mass and height represents inappropriate development within the Green Belt in terms of the guidance contained in the National Planning Policy Framework which is harmful by definition to its open character and appearance. Furthermore, there are no very special circumstances provided or which are evident which either singularly or cumulatively justify the residential use which would overcome the presumption against inappropriate development in the Green Belt. The development is therefore harmful to the Green Belt and the Harefield Village Conservation Area, contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework, Policies 7.8 and 7.16 of the London Plan (2016), Policies BE1, HE1 and EM2 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMEI 4, DMHB 4 and DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2016). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service."
