  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed development, by reason of its siting in a visually prominent position, size, scale, bulk, design and appearance would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the existing and adjoining buildings and would be detrimental to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11, DMCI 1A and DMCI 2 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "The proposal has not demonstrated that the use of the proposed building, by reason of its siting and proximity to residential properties would not be detrimental to the amenities of the adjoining occupiers by reason of increased noise and disturbance contrary to Policies DMHB 11, DMCI 1A and DMCI 2 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "The proposal involves a reduction in car parking spaces and it has not been demonstrated that sufficient off street parking/manoeuvring arrangements would be provided for the existing and proposed uses, and therefore the development is considered to result in substandard car parking provision, leading to on-street parking/queuing to the detriment of public and highway safety and contrary to policies DMT 2 and DMT 6 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020) and to Hillingdon's Adopted Parking Standards as set out in Appendix C of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2016). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020."
