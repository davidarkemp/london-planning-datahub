    "Due to its design, layout and siting (in a rear garden), the proposed dwelling would form a uncharacteristic and visually incongruous development which would fail to harmonise with the existing local and historic character of the surrounding area. The proposal is therefore detrimental to the visual amenity and character of the surrounding area, contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies, Policies DMH 6, DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policies D1, D3 and D6 of the London Plan (2021), as well as paragraphs 72, 128 and 135 of the NPPF (2021).",
    "Due to its location, design and close proximity to No.48 Falling Lane, the proposed dwelling would provide direct, unimpeded views into the rear windows of the mentioned property, causing a unacceptable loss of privacy to its occupiers, which would harm their amenities. Use of the resulting shared garden area and access to the property would also cause unacceptable, noise and disturbance to No.48 Falling Lane.  The proposal is therefore considered to be contrary to policies DMH 6, DMHB 11 of the Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), D3 of the London Plan (2021) and paragraph 135 (f) of the NPPF (2023).",
    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate that proposed dwelling would meet the requirements for a M4(2) accessible and adaptable dwelling as set out in Approved Document M to the Building Regulations (2015 edition). The proposed dwelling would therefore fail to comply with Policy D7 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "The habitable space within the proposed dwelling would be significantly overlooked by No.s 46, 48 and 50 Falling Lane, creating a uncomfortable living environment for its future residents, to the detriment of their amenities (due to a lack of privacy). The dwelling itself would also fail to meet the minimum internal floorspace standards and would therefore provide its future residents with a cramped and unsatisfactory standard of living accommodation. It is therefore considered that the resulting dwelling would provide a poor standard of amenity for its future residents, contrary to to policy D6 of the London Plan (2021) and paragraph 135 (f) of the NPPF (2023).",
    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate that adequate parking would be provided for the new dwelling. The lack of parking provision would lead to kerbside parking (in an area with existing parking provision issues), which in turn reduces highway and pedestrian safety, whilst also prejudicing the free flow of traffic on the local highways network. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy DMT 2 and DMT 6 of the Local Plan and Policy T4 and T6 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan (2021).",
    "This is a reminder that Under the terms of the Planning Act 2008 (as amended) and Community Infrastructure Levy Regulations 2010 (as amended), should an application for appeal be allowed, the proposed development would be deemed as 'chargeable development' and therefore liable to pay the London Borough of Hillingdon Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and the Mayor of London's Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This would be calculated in accordance with the London Borough of Hillingdon CIL Charging Schedule 2014 and the Mayor of London's CIL Charging Schedule 2012.",
