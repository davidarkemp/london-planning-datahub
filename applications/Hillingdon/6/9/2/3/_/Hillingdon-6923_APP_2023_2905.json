    "The proposed development, by virtue of the loss of the existing family dwelling, would conflict with the Borough's strategic housing goal of safeguarding 3-bedroom family dwellings and the proposed change of use to a Large HMO would be harmful to the character of the area and consequently, the principle of development is considered to be unacceptable. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies DMH 1, DMH 5, DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2023).",
    "In the absence of a submitted transport appraisal and travel plan demonstrating that sufficient off-street parking has been provided, as required by the local parking standard for the proposed level of occupancy, the proposal has the potential to lead to undue on-street parking displacement to the detriment of parking capacity and safety on the local public highway. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies DMH 5, DMT 1, DMT 2 and DMT 6 (Appendix C) of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 Development Management Policies (2020) and Policy T4 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2023).",
    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate that the proposal and the high number of potential occupants, would not result in noise and general disturbance to neighbouring properties alongside a harmful over intensification of the use of the site, detrimental to both the occupiers and neighbouring properties and the residential amenity of the area. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies DMH 5, DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policies D3 and D13 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2023).",
    "The development, by virtue of it's failure to maintain an adequate amount of private usable internal living space for the occupiers of the proposed development, would result in substandard living accommodation and an over-development of the site to the detriment of the residential amenity of future occupiers. The development is therefore contrary to the requirements of Policies DMH 5, DMHB 11 and DMHB 16  of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020) and Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2021). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020."
