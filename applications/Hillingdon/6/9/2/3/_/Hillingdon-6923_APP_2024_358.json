    "Due to the overall size of bedroom 1 and bedroom 4, the proposal would be more akin to a large HMO (sui generis). The establishment of a large HMO for up to eight occupants is inappropriate and incompatible with the character and form of existing residential development in the local area. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies DMH 5 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate that the proposal and the high number of potential occupants, would not result in noise and general disturbance to neighbouring properties alongside a harmful over intensification of the use of the site, detrimental to both the occupiers and neighbouring properties and the residential amenity of the area. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies DMH 5, DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policies D3 and D13 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2023).",
    "The development, by virtue of it's failure to maintain an adequate amount of private usable internal living space for the occupiers of the proposed development.  Moreover, the application fails to demonstrate that noise transfer between the communal area and bedroom 2 could be adequately controlled, in order to provide a suitable level of acoustic amenity for the future occupants of bedroom 2. Collectively, these issues would result in a substandard form of accommodation for future occupants. contrary to Section 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023), Policies D6 and D14 of the London Plan (2021) and Policies DMH5, DMHB 11 and DMHB 16  of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2021). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020."
