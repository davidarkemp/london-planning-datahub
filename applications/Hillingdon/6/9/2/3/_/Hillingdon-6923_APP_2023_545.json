    "The proposed dwelling by reason of its size, scale, bulk, depth, width, site coverage, siting and design, in this prominent position, would fail to harmonise with the local context, established street pattern and building lines and would result in a cramped for of development that closes an important gap characteristic to the area. The proposed dwelling would be incongruous, visually dominant and detrimental to the visual amenities of the street scene and the character and appearance of the area. The proposed development is unacceptable in principle and conflicts with Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One Strategic Policies (2012), Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMH 6 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021) and Chapter 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The proposed development would place undue development pressure on various healthy Council owned trees on adopted highway within a tree preservation area, that contribute positively to the local landscape character of the area. Inadequate provision is made to safeguard these existing trees within the site and the adjacent tree preservation area that would be affected. The development proposal therefore conflicts with Policies DMHB 11 and DMHB 14 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policies G1 and G7 of the London Plan (2021) and Chapter 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The proposed new dwelling, by virtue of its proximity, scale, and depth, would be harmful on the residential amenity of the occupiers of No.4 Rofant Road, in terms of overdominance, loss of outlook and creating an undue sense of enclosure. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012), Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local plan - Part Two (2020), Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021) and Paragraph 130f) of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "Both the host dwelling at No.4 Rofant Road and the proposed new dwelling would be provided with insufficient and impractical private garden areas that would result in poor quality private amenity space, and substandard living conditions for residents at both properties.  The development proposal therefore conflicts with Policy DMHB 18 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020) which places emphasis on good quality and useable amenity spaces.",
    "The proposed new dwelling would not be provided with adequate living conditions for future occupiers due to its substandard floor to ceiling heights, poor outlook and substandard provision of sunlight and daylight. The development proposal therefore conflicts with the housing standards of Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021) and Policy DMHB 16 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020), and Chapter 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The new dwelling does not have a defined frontage that faces towards the street, the design and layout of the proposed dwelling is not considered appropriate to deter opportunities for crime. The development proposal therefore conflicts with Policy D11 of the London Plan (2021) and Policy DMHB 15 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "In the absence of a basement impact assessment, it has not been satisfactorily demonstrated that the development proposal would not cause harm to the built and natural environment, and local amenity and does not result in flooding. The development proposal therefore conflicts with Policies DMHD 3, DMEI 9 and DMEI 10 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan (2021) and national guidance.",
    "This is a reminder that Under the terms of the Planning Act 2008 (as amended) and Community Infrastructure Levy Regulations 2010 (as amended), should an application for appeal be allowed, the proposed development would be deemed as 'chargeable development' and therefore liable to pay the London Borough of Hillingdon Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and the Mayor of London's Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This would be calculated in accordance with the London Borough of Hillingdon CIL Charging Schedule 2014 and the Mayor of London's CIL Charging Schedule 2012. For more information on CIL matters please visit the planning portal page at: www.planningportal.gov.uk/planning/applications/howtoapply/whattosubmit/cil",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principle of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
