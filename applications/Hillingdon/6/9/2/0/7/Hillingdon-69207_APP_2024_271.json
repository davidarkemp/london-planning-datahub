    "Due to the excessive massing, size, bulk, depths and design of the extensions, the proposal would form a disproportionate and overly dominant collections of additions to the host dwelling which would fail to respect its original size or architectural composition, subsequently causing harm to its character and appearance. Furthermore due to the design and prominent open plot location, the resulting property would appear unduly prominent and overdeveloped when viewed from the flats at Littlefield Court and from the main road, causing significant harm to the character and appearance of the surrounding area contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 4, DMHD 1, DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service. This is a resubmission of a previously refused scheme, where the Inspectors Report identified issues to be addressed, which were reflected in the reasons for refusal, allowing the opportunity to address those issues within this submission."
