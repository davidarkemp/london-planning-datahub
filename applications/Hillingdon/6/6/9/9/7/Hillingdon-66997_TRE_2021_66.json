    "The Oak is situated within the front garden of 10B Monarchs Way. The tree represents a prominent landscape feature for the residents of Monarch's Way and it is highly visible from multiple angles within the street. The tree greatly contributes to the visual amenity of the area and it has a high-to-very-high amenity value. The benefit in amenity and biodiversity afforded by the tree is both present and future because it has the potential for long-life expectancy.",
    "The Oak has previously received a crown reduction and thinning, but has never been pollarded. Pollarding of this tree is considered too drastic, as the complete removal of the crown would both negatively impact the visual amenity and arboreal character of the tree, and would likely cause high stress to the tree and potentially lead to infection, affecting the long-term health of the tree.",
    "Having regard to the reasons given for the proposed work, the work is unjustified and will have a detrimental impact on the visual amenity",
    "The removal of deadwood, dangerous / hanging branches and ivy:  This does not require the formal consent of the Council."
