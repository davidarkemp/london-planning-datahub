    "The proposed hip to gable conversion over garage and side/rear dormer, by reason of its siting in this visually prominent position, size, scale, bulk, roof form and design would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original and nearby dwellings and would be detrimental to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the street scene and surrounding area. Therefore, the proposal would be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021) and Chapter 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021)."
