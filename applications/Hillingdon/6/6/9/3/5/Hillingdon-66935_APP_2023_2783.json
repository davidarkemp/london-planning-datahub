    "Due to its design, size and siting (in a rear garden), the proposed dwelling and associated development would form a cramped, uncharacteristic and visually incongruous development which would fail to harmonise with the existing local and historic character and appearance of the surrounding area. The principle of intensifying the residential use of the site to the level proposed, as well as the proposed loss of existing private rear garden area, would have a detrimental impact on the character, appearance and visual amenity of the residential area as a whole. The proposal is therefore detrimental to the visual amenity and character of the surrounding area, contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies, Policies DMH 6, DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policies D1, D3 and D6 of the London Plan (2021), as well as paragraphs 71, 124 and 130 of the NPPF (2021).",
    "The proposed building would be sited in close proximity to the rear gardens and windows of No.187 and No.189 Grosvenor Avenue. Due to its height, depth, bulk and close proximity to those neighbours,  the building would cause a signficant loss of light and overshadowing to their habitable rear windows and garden spaces. The building would also be visually oppressive and overbearing when viewed from the rear windows and gardens of those properties causing a signficant loss of outlook. The loss of light and outlook would be significantly harmful to the amenities of the mentioned neighbours. The development would therefore be contrary to Policy DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies and paragraph 130 (f) of the NPPF (2021).",
    "Due to the fact that it would be severely overlooked by the first floor rear windows of No.187 and No.189 Grosvenor Avenue, the external amenity space for the new dwelling would be of poor quality to the detriment of the living conditions and amenities of its future residents. Furthermore the existing dwelling would be provided with undersized external amenity space commensurate to its level of occupation, the lack of amenity space for a house of this size would be of detriment to the amenities of its existing and future occupiers. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy DMHB 18 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies, Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021) and paragraph 130 (f) of the NPPF (2021).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan (2021) and NPPF (2021).",
    "This is a reminder that Under the terms of the Planning Act 2008 (as amended) and Community Infrastructure Levy Regulations 2010 (as amended), should an application for appeal be allowed, the proposed development would be deemed as 'chargeable development' and therefore liable to pay the London Borough of Hillingdon Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and the Mayor of London's Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This would be calculated in accordance with the London Borough of Hillingdon CIL Charging Schedule 2014 and the Mayor of London's CIL Charging Schedule 2012.",
