    "The proposed building, by reason of its excessive size, scale, bulk and height (noting the variance in ground levels at the site) would result in an  over dominant and visually obtrusive form of development that fails to respect the prevailing pattern of development within the area and would appear insubordinate to the main host dwelling. As a result, the proposal would be detrimental to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the surrounding area. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012), Policies DMHD 2, DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The proposed development, by reason of the extensive coverage of the rear garden by the proposed outbuilding and raised patio, would erode the open soft landscaping within the rear garden which currently makes a positive contribution to the suburban character of the area. The proposal would therefore be detrimental to the visual amenities of the verdant character and appearance of the surrounding area, contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012), Policies DMHD 2, DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The proposed outbuilding, by reason of its proximity, size, scale, bulk and height (noting the variance in ground levels at the site) would cause harm to the living conditions of the existing neighbouring occupiers at numbers 1 St Edmunds Avenue, 5 St Edmunds Avenue and 1  Broadwood Avenue and their associated private external amenity space, in terms of loss of outlook, sense of enclosure and overbearing impact. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The proposed raised patio, by virtue of proximity, size, scale and height, would cause harm to the living conditions of the existing neighbouring occupiers at numbers 1 and 5 St Edmunds Avenue and their associated private external amenity space, in terms of loss of privacy and overlooking issues. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "In the absence of an Arboricultural Impact Assessment, Method Statement and Tree Protection Plan to BS5837:2012, the application has failed to demonstrate that the proposed outbuilding could be constructed without undue harm to the trees within the adjoining rear garden at number 1",
    "Broadwood Avenue, which includes an 'A' grade Oak that is protected by Tree Preservation Order 277. The potential harm caused to the trees",
    "would undermine the character and visual amenity of the area. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One Strategic Policies (2012) and Policy DMHB 11 and DMHB 14 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2: Development Management Policies (2020) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2021). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
