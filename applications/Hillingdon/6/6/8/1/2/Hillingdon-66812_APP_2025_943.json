    "The proposed front/side and rear extension, by reason of its size, scale, bulk and overall design would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original dwelling and, would be detrimental to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding Hillside, Hillside Northwood Hills Area of Special Local Character. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies BE1 and HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 1, DMHB 5, DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), Policy 7.8 of the London Plan (2021) and the NPPF 2024.",
    "The proposed roof extensions by reason of their bulk, form, design, depth, size and siting would be overly large, fail to harmonise with the existing character of the dwelling and fail to read as subservient additions, subsequently failing to preserve or enhance the character and appearance of the streetscene of Hillside Northwood Hills Area of Special Local Character, all contrary to the NPPF (2021), Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One Strategic Policies (2012) and Policies DMHD 1, DMHB 5 and DMHB 11 of of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The proposed rear extension, by virtue of its height, bulk, form, depth, size, siting and proximity, would be detrimental to the amenities of the neighbouring occupiers, by reason of overdominance, overshadowing, loss of light, loss of outlook and creating a sense of enclosure. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policies BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan (2021) and national guidance."
