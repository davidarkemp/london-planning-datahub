    "The visual impact of the proposed outbuilding  by reason of its excessive scale, bulk, design and subsequent massing along with the loss of two trees would result in an overly dominant and visually obtrusive form of development which would be out of keeping with the backland pattern of development in the area, to the detriment of the character and appearance of the surrounding area. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies D3, D4 and G7 of the London Plan (2021), Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHD1; DMHB 11, DMHB14 and DMHD 2  of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - (2020)."
