    "The proposed hip to gable conversion for both the front and rear elevation, by virtue of the design, scale, size, bulk and massing, would fail would appear as disproportionate and incongruous addition that would fail to respect the original roof form,  architectural composition of the original dwelling, and would visually unbalance the appearance and the proportions of the group of terraced properties. Consequently, the proposal would cause significant harm to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the host property and the surrounding area, contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One- Strategic Policies (2012), Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policies  D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021) and Chapter 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "a) We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal.",
