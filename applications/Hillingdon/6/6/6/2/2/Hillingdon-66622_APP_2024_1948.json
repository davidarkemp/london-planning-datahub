    "The proposed outbuilding, due to its elevated position and design, would be inconsistent with the established pattern of development in the area and is considered to have an unacceptable impact on the character and visual amenity of the surrounding area and would undermine the significance of the Conservation Area resulting in a low level of less than substantial harm that would not be outweighed by the public benefits of the development. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies HE1 and BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies; Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12, DMHB 1 and DMHB 4 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020); Policies D4 and HC1 of the London Plan 2021; and Paragraphs 139 and 215 of the NPPF.",
    "The proposed outbuilding, due to its elevated position, scale, design, and proximity to neighbouring properties, specifically 4 and 5 Caroline Close, would have an oppressive and overbearing impact, by reason of scale and height and would result in an unacceptable level of overlooking, causing a detrimental impact on the privacy and amenity of these residents. The proposal is therefore contrary to policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12, DMHD 1 and DMHD 2 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
