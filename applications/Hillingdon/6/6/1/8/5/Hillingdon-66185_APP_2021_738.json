  "description": "Part two storey, part single storey rear extension and conversion of roof space to habitable use to include a rear dormer and and 1 front rooflight",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed part two storey extension, by reason of its size, scale, bulk and design in relation to the proposed changes to the roof and the creation of a crown/flat roof element and the size, scale, bulk, and design of the rear dormer window, would result in an incongruous form of development, which would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original dwelling and would thus be detrimental to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "In the absence of a Tree Survey and Arboricultural Implication Assessment to BS5837:2012 standards, the application has failed to demonstrate that the development will safeguard the existing protected tree (T2) and further fails to demonstrate protection for and long-term retention of the tree. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies, DMHB 11 and DMHB 14 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies.",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2016). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020."
