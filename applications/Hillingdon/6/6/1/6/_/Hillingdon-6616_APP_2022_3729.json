Sections 93 and 94 of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 give local authorities the power to serve 'Street Litter Control Notices' requiring businesses to clear up the litter and implement measures to prevent the land from becoming littered again.  By imposing a 'Street Litter Control Notice', the local authority has the power to force businesses to clean up the area in the vicinity of their premises, provide and empty bins and do anything else which may be necessary to remove litter.  Amendments made to the 1990 Act by the Clean Neighbourhoods and Environment Act 2005 have made it immediately an offence to fail to comply with the requirements of a Street Litter Control Notice, and fixed penalties may be issued as an alternative to prosecution.",

    "in some circumstances, carry out groundworks within 6 metres of an adjoining building.",
    "Notification and agreements under this Act are the responsibility of the building owner and are quite separate from Building Regulations, or Planning Controls. The Building Control Service will assume that an applicant has obtained any necessary agreements with the adjoining owner, and nothing said or implied by the Council should be taken as removing the necessity for the building owner to comply fully with the Party Wall Act.

As part of the Act, service providers are obliged to improve access to and within the structure of their building, particularly in situations where reasonable adjustment can be incorporated with relative ease. The Act states that service providers should think ahead to take steps to address barriers that impede disabled people.",
