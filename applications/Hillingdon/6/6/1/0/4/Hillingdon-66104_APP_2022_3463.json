    "The proposed development and resultant roof form, by reason of its cumulative size, scale, bulk, massing and design, would appear as a disproportionate and incongruous form of development that would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original dwelling, detrimental to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the street scene and the wider Hillingdon Court Area of Special Local Character. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies BE1 and HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 1, DMHB 5, DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), HC1 and D4 of the London Plan and the NPPF.",
    "The Applicant has failed to demonstrate with an appropriate tree survey, the location, height, spread and species of trees on and adjacent to the site which are subject to a Tree Preservation Order. Without this information, the applications fails to demonstrate the development would retain or enhance existing landscaping, trees, biodiversity or other natural features of merit, all contrary to Policies DMHB14 of the Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and the NPPF.",
    "The extent of demolition is unclear as no demolition drawings have been received. The applicant is however, advised that this development is likely to require FULL planning permission given the extent of demolition proposed.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service. We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
