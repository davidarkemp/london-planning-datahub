    "The development, by reason of its height, bulk, and proximity, would unduly harm the residential amenity of the neighbouring occupiers at 13-15 Swakeleys Road due to loss of daylight/sunlight. The development, therefore, conflicts with Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012), Policy DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan - Part Two (2020) and Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "The development, by reason of its height, depth, size, bulk, design, massing, and balconies, would unduly harm the character and appearance of the area and the visual amenities of the street scene. The development, therefore, conflicts with Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 - Strategic Policies (2012), Policies DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021) and Paragraph 135(b) and (c) of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023).",
    "The development, by reason of its failure to provide an appropriate provision of a good quality outlook, private outdoor amenity areas, and daylight and sunlight to habitable rooms, would be unduly harmful to the living conditions of future occupants. The development, therefore, conflicts with Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 16, and DMHB 18 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020) and Policies D3 and D6 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "The cycle parking, by reason of the first-floor location, would be poorly accessible, potentially restricting or preventing the use of the parking by some future occupants and being detrimental to the overall uptake of cycling by future occupiers, contrary to Policy DMT 5 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 (2020) and Policy T6 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "The proposed refuse layout, by reason of its inaccessible location and long carry distances, raises safety and accessibility concerns for future residents and is contrary to Policies SI7 and D6 of the London Plan (2021) and Policy DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 (2020).",
    "In the absence of water usage and design information, it has not been demonstrated that the proposal would achieve sufficient water efficiency contrary to Policy DMEI 10 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The proposal has not demonstrated the existing public house use would not be adversely affected by the development in accordance with the Agent of Change principle by reason that the remediation of the significant loss of existing public house floorspace has not been detailed and insufficient noise information has been provided to confirm the proposed residential flats would not restrict the ongoing noise generation and use of the public house. The development is, therefore, contrary to Policies HC7 and D13 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "In the absence of satisfactory acoustic information, it has not been demonstrated that the proposed residential flats would not be exposed to excessive internal noise levels from the ground floor public house use that could result in ongoing harm to onsite residential amenity, contrary to Policies D13 and D14 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2021). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal.",
    "This is a reminder that Under the terms of the Planning Act 2008 (as amended) and Community Infrastructure Levy Regulations 2010 (as amended), should an application for appeal be allowed, the proposed development would be deemed as 'chargeable development' and therefore liable to pay the London Borough of Hillingdon Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and the Mayor of London's Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This would be calculated in accordance with the London Borough of Hillingdon CIL Charging Schedule 2014 and the Mayor of London's CIL Charging Schedule 2012.
