  "description": "Two storey front extension, single storey rear extension and first floor rear extension",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed rear extension, by reason of its size, scale, bulk and design, would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original building and would fail to either preserve or enhance the character or appearance of the surrounding Ruislip Village Conservation Area. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies BE1 and HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 1, DMHB 4 and DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), Policy 7.8 of the London Plan (2016) and the NPPF.",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant saved policies (referred to as policies from the Hillingdon Unitary Development Plan - Saved Policies September 2007), then London Plan Policies (2016).  On the 8th November 2012 Hillingdon's Full Council agreed the adoption of the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies. Appendix 5 of this explains which saved policies from the old Unitary Development (which was subject to a direction from Secretary of State in September 2007 agreeing that the policies were 'saved') still apply for development control decisions.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the 'Saved' UDP 2007, Local Plan Part 1, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "The Council has  however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal.",
    "The submitted information does not include a heritage statement and/or a design and access statement, thus failing to meet the minimal requirements of paragraph 189 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), Policy DMHB 4 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020) and Paragraph 5.15 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020). In the event of a resubmission, the proposal should be supported by a Heritage Statement, which demonstrates how the proposals have adopted a design-led approach to take account of the special character of the area."
