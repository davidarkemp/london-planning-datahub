    "The roof alteration/extensions, by reason of the hip to gable end roof design and the size, scale, bulk, design and siting in this visually prominent position, of the rear dormer window would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original dwelling and would be detrimental to the character, appearance and the visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies BE13, BE15 and BE19 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Unitary Development Plan Saved Policies (November 2012) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document HDAS: Residential Extensions.",
