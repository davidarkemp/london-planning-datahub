    "Given the nature of the proposed application, it is possible that a crane may be required during development.  We would, therefore, draw the applicant's attention to the requirement within the British Standard Code of Practice for the safe use of Cranes, for crane operators to consult the aerodrome before erecting a crane in close proximity to an aerodrome. This is explained further in Advice Note 4, 'Cranes' (available at http://www.aoa.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Advice-Note-4-Cranes-2016.pdf)",
    "There is a possibility there may be contaminating substances present in the ground at depth. We have some limited information on nearby ground conditions. We would therefore advise persons working on site to take basic precautions in relation to any contamination they may find. Precautions should be taken to minimise the mixing of any excavated material with clean shallow soils that are to remain on site.",
    "You are advised this development is on a former landfill. The advice is provided on the grounds of Health and Safety of the workers on site and to ensure the appropriate restoration of the site once works are complete to minimise risk to the occupants of the site."
