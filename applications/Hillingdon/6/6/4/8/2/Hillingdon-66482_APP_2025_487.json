    "The development hereby permitted shall not be carried out except in complete accordance with the details shown on the submitted plans:",
    "1.0 LOCATION - SITE PLAN",
    "5.0 PROPOSED PLAN & ELEVATION",
    "REASON",
    "To ensure the development complies with the provisions of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020), and the London Plan (2021).",
    "The materials to be used in the construction of the external surfaces of the development hereby permitted shall match those used in the existing building and shall thereafter be retained as such.",
    "REASON",

    "The shopfront hereby approved shall ensure that step-free access for wheelchair users is maintained from the public footway, via a profiled threshold or water bar not exceeding 15 mm in height and a doorway width of no less than 1000 mm, with all such features remaining in place for the life of the building.",
    "REASON: To ensure an Accessible and Inclusive development for everyone in accordance with London Plan policy D5.",
    "This permission does not authorise the display of advertisements or signs, separate consent for which may be required under the Town and Country Planning (Control of Advertisements) Regulations 2007.

For further information and advice, contact - Residents Services, 3N/04, Civic Centre, High Street, Uxbridge, UB8 1UW (Tel. 01895 250574).",
    "The Equality Act 2010 seeks to protect people accessing goods, facilities and services from discrimination on the basis of a 'protected characteristic', which includes those with a disability. As part of the Act, service providers are obliged to improve access to and within the structure of their building, particularly in situations where reasonable adjustment can be incorporated with relative ease. The Act states that service providers should think ahead to take steps to address barriers that impede disabled people.",
    "The decision to GRANT planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2021). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020.",
