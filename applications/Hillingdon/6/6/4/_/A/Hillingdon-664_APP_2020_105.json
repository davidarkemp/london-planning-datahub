  "description": "Reconfigure access road to create one way vehicular circulation, provision of 26 additional parking bays and an enlarged terrace adjacent to the dining hall",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed development would involve the unacceptable loss of open space/playing fields reducing access to sports and recreation opportunities for existing pupils and the wider community, contrary to Policy EM4 of the adopted Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policy DMCI 3 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020) and paragraph 97 of the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF).",
    "In the absence of a comprehensive Transport Statement which justifies the need for additional on site parking at the school the development would give rise to conditions prejudicial to pedestrian and highway safety. As such the development would be contrary to Policies DMT 1, DMT 2 and DMT 6 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020) and Policies 6.1, 6.3 and 6.13 of the London Plan (2016).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan - The Spatial Development Strategy for London consolidated with alterations since 2011 (2016) and national guidance.",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2016). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020."
