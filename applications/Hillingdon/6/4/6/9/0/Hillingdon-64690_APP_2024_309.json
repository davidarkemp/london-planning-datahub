    "Due to the combination of its roof pitch, height, bulk, scale and mass, the proposed front and roof extensions would form an oversized set of additions that would not be subordinate to the existing dwelling and fail to respect its original design and appearance. Due to its location, size and design, the resulting building would also form an unduly prominent, incongruous, and visually harmful addition to the, Area of Special Local Character and Belmont Close. The proposed development is therefore contrary to Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 5 and DMHD 1 of the Local Plan, Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020), as well as Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021) and paragraph 135 of the NPPF (2023)."
