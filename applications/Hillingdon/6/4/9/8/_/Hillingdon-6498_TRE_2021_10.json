  "decision_conditions": [
    "The pine is located in the front garden of Calver Lodge, Frithwood Avenue and is highly visible. It makes a positive contribution to the landscape character and amenity of the area. The tree has moderate-to-high amenity value.",
    "At the time of inspection, the tree was found to be in reasonable overall physiological condition with no obvious significant structural defects. The stem does have a reasonable lean toward Calver Lodge. The proposed work will result in the loss of a significant tree. The application has not been supported by written arboricultural advice or other diagnostic information from an appropriate expert.",
    "Having regard to the reasons given for the proposed work, the work is unjustified and will have a detrimental impact on the visual amenity and arboreal character of the area.",
    "The removal of deadwood, dangerous / hanging branches and ivy:  This does not require the formal consent of the Council."
