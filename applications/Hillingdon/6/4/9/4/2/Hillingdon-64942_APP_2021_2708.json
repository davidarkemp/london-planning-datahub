Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11, DMH 6, and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), policy D3 of the London Plan (2021) and Section 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",

As such the application fails to comply with Policy DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies, policy D3 of the London Plan (2021) and Section 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",

As such the proposal fails to satisfy Policies DMT 1, DMT 2 and DMT 6 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 Development Management Policies (2020)."
