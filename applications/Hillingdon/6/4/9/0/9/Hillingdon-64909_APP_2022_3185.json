  "description": "Erection of a single storey rear extension and a part single storey, part double side extension. Conversion of roof space to habitable use to include a rear dormer, 3 front roof lights and conversion of roof from hip to gable end",
  "decision_date": "16/01/2023",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed roof extensions combined with first floor side extension by reason of the combined scale, bulk, massing and design would result in a dominant, disproportionate, and visually intrusive form of development that would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original dwelling and the established character and appearance of the Raisins Hill Area of Special Local Character. Consequently the proposal would cause harm to the visual amenity of the streetscene and the character and appearance of the area, contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012), Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021), Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12, DMHD 1 and DMHB 5 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "By virtue of its depth, height and proximity, the proposed single storey rear extension would cause harm to the residential amenities of no. 43 Raisins Hill through overbearing impact, overshadowing, a sense of enclosure and loss of light, contrary to Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan (2021) and national guidance."
