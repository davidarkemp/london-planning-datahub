    "The proposed rear dormer, by reason of it's size, scale, bulk and design would represent a discordant and incongruous addition which would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original dwelling and would be detrimental to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the street scene and the wider area. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "The proposed hip to gable roof extension, by reason of it's size, scale, bulk and design would represent a discordant and incongruous addition which would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original dwelling and would unbalance the appearance of the host property and the adjoining property and would be detrimental to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the street scene and the wider area. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2021).
