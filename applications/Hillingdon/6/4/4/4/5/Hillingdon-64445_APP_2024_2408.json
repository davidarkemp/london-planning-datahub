    "There is a possibility that there are some contaminating substances in the ground of the site. Our contaminated land record shows the site to be on a former contaminated land use identified as MOD Land/Rifle Range and Works (various). It is therefore advised that persons working on site shall take basic precautions in relation to any contamination they may find. This advice is provided on the grounds of Health and Safety of the workers on site and to ensure the appropriate restoration of the site is done. Should there be any contamination identified during the development where there is a need for ground work once such works are complete to minimise risk to the occupants of the site."
