    "The conversion of the four-bedroom dwelling into 1 x 1-bed and 1 x 2-bed flats would result in the loss of a residential unit that is suitable and appropriately sized for a family. The proposal would therefore unacceptably undermine the supply of family housing within the Borough for which there is an identified need, contrary to Policies DMH 1 and DMH 2 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy H10 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2023).",
    "The proposed first floor flat would have no private outdoor amenity space. The occupiers of the new dwelling would therefore be subjected to a poor standard of living accommodation to the detriment of their amenities. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policy DMHB 18 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and paragraph 135 (f) of the NPPF (2023).",
    "The proposed development proposes three car parking spaces which would result in an over provision of car parking, the proposal would therefore be contrary to Policy T6.1 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "The proposed development, by virtue of the proximity of the on-site car parking space in relation to the front habitable windows, would cause unacceptable noise, disturbance, overlooking and loss of privacy for the future occupants of the ground floor flat. The proposal would therefore result in a substandard form of internal residential accommodation to the detriment of the amenity of the future occupiers of the proposed development, contrary to Policies DMHB 15 and DMHB 16 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2023).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan (2021) and NPPF(2023)."
