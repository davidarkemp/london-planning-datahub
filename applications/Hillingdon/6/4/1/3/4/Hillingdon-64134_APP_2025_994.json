    "The conversion of the three-bedroom dwelling into 2 x 2-bedroom flats (one of which is substandard) would result in the loss of a residential unit that is suitable and appropriately sized for a family. The proposal would therefore unacceptably undermine the supply of family housing within the Borough for which there is an identified need, contrary to Policies DMH 1 and DMH 2 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy H10 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2024).",
    "Due to its cramped and substandard internal floor layout Flat B would provide future residents with poor and unacceptable living accommodation to the detriment of their amenities. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policy DMHB 16 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021) and paragraph 135 (f) of the National Planning Policy Framework (2024).",
    "In the absence of evidence demonstrating the applicant's eligibility for the self-build register, a satisfactory legal agreement to ensure the proposed development is self-build or a Biodiversity Net Gain Assessment confirming that the required 10% net gain can be provided onsite, the proposed development is contrary to Schedule 7A of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as inserted by the Environment Act 2021), Policy DMEI 7 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and paragraphs 179 and 180 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2024).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan (2021) and NPPF (2024)."
