    "The proposed first floor side/rear extension alongside the first floor rear wrap-around projection, by virtue of its siting, combined height, width, depth, bulk and massing including the flat roof design, would result in a boxy, bulky, visually intrusive, disproportionate, incongruous, dominant and overbearing addition that would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original dwelling, relationship with the properties within the Cullera Close cul-de-sac of which it forms a part to, visual amenities of the streetscene and character and appearance of the Frithwood Conservation Area. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012), Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy HC1 of the London Plan (2021) and Section 16 of the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF).",
    "The proposed first floor side/rear extension alongside the first floor rear wrap-around projection, by virtue of its close siting, combined height, width, depth, bulk and massing including the flat roof design, would give rise to unacceptable loss of outlook, overbearing impact, visual intrusion, sense of enclosure and some loss of daylight/sunlight to the occupiers at at No.4 and 5 Cullera Close. Therefore, the proposal would be contrary to Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2021). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020."
