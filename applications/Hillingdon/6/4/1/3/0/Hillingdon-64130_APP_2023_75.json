    "The proposed first floor rear extension by virtue of its unsympathetic design and resulting roof forms, would result in a bulky, visually intrusive, incongruous and dominant addition that would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original dwelling, the relationship with the properties within the Cullera Close cul-de-sac, the visual amenities of the streetscene and would fail to preserve or enhance the character and appearance of the Frithwood Conservation Area. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012), Policies DMHB 4, DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policies D3 and HC1 of the London Plan (2021) and Chapters 12 and 16 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The development proposal would fail to retain an adequate private amenity space and would impact on the outlook from and the source of natural light entering the rear bedroom, thereby detrimentally harming the living conditions of the occupiers. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policies DMHB 18 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021) and Section 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2021). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
