    "The proposed development, by reason of the reduced rear garden size, combined with the creation of additional bedrooms, would be detrimental to the amenities of the current and future occupiers of 17 Floriston Avenue, and would give rise to a substandard form of accommodation, by reason of loss of significant private amenity space and an uncharacteristically small rear garden. As such, the proposal would be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One Strategic Policies (2012) and Policies DMHD 1, DMHB 11 and DMHB 18 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service."
