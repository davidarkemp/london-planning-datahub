    "The proposed development by reason of its excessive size, scale, width, proximity to the boundary and roof form would fail to appear as a subordinate addition and would thus fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original semi-detached dwellinghouse and would be detrimental to the visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area.  The proposal would also result in the closing of an important gap characteristic to the area resuling in a cramped appearance. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), Policies D4 and D8 of the London Plan (2021) and the NPPF (2021).",
    "The proposed development by reason of its size, design and proximity to the boundary of the site would be detrimental to the residential amenities of the adjoining propert at No.4 Eastwood Road by reason of overdominance, overshadowing, visual intrusion, loss of light and loss of outlook.  Therefore the proposal would be contrary to the requirements of Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
