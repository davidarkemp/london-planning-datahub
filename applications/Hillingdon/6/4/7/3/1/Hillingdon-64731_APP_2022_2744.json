    "The development proposal, by reason of its scale, height, width, depth, siting and design would result in an excessive, bulky, incongruous, dominant, overbearing and visually intrusive form of development that would be detrimental to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area and would harm the residential amenities of the adjacent occupiers. The proposal would therefore conflict with Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One Strategic Policies (2012) and Policies DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), policy D3 of the London Plan (2021) and Chapter 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The National Planning Policy Guidance classifies development types according to their vulnerability to flood risk and provides guidance on which developments are appropriate within each Flood Zone. This site lies within Flood Zone 3b, the functional floodplain, which is land defined by the submitted Strategic Flood Risk Assessment as having the highest probability of flooding. The development is classed as more vulnerable in accordance with table 2 of the Flood Zones and flood risk tables of the PPG. Tables 1 and 2 make it clear that this type of development is not compatible with this Flood Zone and therefore should not be permitted. The proposal therefore conflicts with Policy EM6 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1- Strategic Policies (Nov 2012), Policy DMEI 9 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 - Development Management Policies (Jan 2020), Policy SI 12 of the London Plan (2021), the Flood Risk and Coastal Change section of the National Planning Policy Guidance and Paragraph 167 of",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2021). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal.",
    "This is a reminder that Under the terms of the Planning Act 2008 (as amended) and Community Infrastructure Levy Regulations 2010 (as amended), should an application for appeal be allowed, the proposed development would be deemed as 'chargeable development' and therefore liable to pay the London Borough of Hillingdon Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and the Mayor of London's Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This would be calculated in accordance with the London Borough of Hillingdon CIL Charging Schedule 2014 and the Mayor of London's CIL Charging Schedule 2012.
