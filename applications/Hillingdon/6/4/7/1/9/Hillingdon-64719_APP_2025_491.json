    "The proposed development, by virtue of its excessive width across the entire frontage of the existing dwelling would not read as a subordinate addition to the host dwelling in this visually prominent corner location, harming the character and appearance of the street scene and area.  The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2021), Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management (2020) and Chapter 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework.",
