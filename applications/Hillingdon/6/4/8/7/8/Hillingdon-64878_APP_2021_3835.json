    "The proposed two storey side/rear extension, by reason of its size, scale, bulk, width and design would result in an incongruous addition which would would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original dwelling, would be detrimental to the character, appearance and symmetry of the small terrace of houses of which it forms a part and to the visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the  Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "The proposed two storey side/rear extension, by reason of its size, design and proximity, would result in an overly dominant feature that overshadows the adjoining properties at Nos. 98.96,94 and 92 Stowe Crescent and as such would result in a visually intrusive and an un-neighbourly form of development, resulting in a loss of light and material loss of residential amenity. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to policies DMHB11 and DMHD1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan - Part Two (2020).",
    "The application site is located within a Critical Drainage Area, an area known for surface water flooding and Flood Zone 2/3.  The applicant has failed to demonstrate compliance with Policy DMEI 9 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) which states development proposed in Flood Zone 2 will be required to submit an appropriate Flood Risk Assessment to demonstrate the development is resilient to all sources of flooding. As no details have been submitted the application fails to comply and poses and unacceptable flood risk.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
