    "The Council is aware of the presence of land, situated within 250 metres of the subject site, with the potential to emit landfill gas. However, the risk of gas migration is considered minimal due to the age, nature and/or location of the fill. It is recommended that ground penetrating structure/s and any associated electrical enclosures and supply cables are designed and constructed to prevent/minimise possible entry of any migrating landfill gas."
