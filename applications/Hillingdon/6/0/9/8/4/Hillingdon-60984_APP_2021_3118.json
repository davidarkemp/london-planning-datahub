    "The proposed telecommunications lattice tower and associated equipment would, by virtue of their siting, size, scale, bulk and height, represent a visually dominant development that would harm the open character of the green belt and wider area. The development would therefore be contrary to paragraph 115 and Section 13 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy G2 of the London Plan (2021), EM2 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012) and Policies DMHB 21 and DMEI 4 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The Local Planning Authority considers that the applicants have failed to provide robust evidence to demonstrate that other more suitable and less harmful sites do not exist, and that they have actively explored the possibility of erecting the proposed telecommunications equipment on existing buildings, masts or other structures. Furthermore, very special circumstances have not been demonstrated to justify the proposed inappropriate development on green belt. The development would therefore be contrary to paragraphs 115, 117 c), and Section 13 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy G2 of the London Plan (2021) and Policies DMHB 21 and DMEI 4 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020)."
