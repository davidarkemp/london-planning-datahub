    "The proposal, by reason of its size, scale, bulk, height, depth, width, proximity to the side boundary and siting in this open prominent position, would result in the loss of an important gap characteristic to the area, particularly at first floor level, resulting in a cramped appearance. The proposal would therefore represent an overdevelopment of the site to the detriment of the visual amenities of the street scene and the character and appearance of the surrounding area. Therefore the proposal is contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies BE13, BE15 and BE19 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Saved UDP Policies (November 2012), Policies 3.5 and 7.4 of the London Plan (2016) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Documents HDAS: Residential Layouts and  HDAS: Residential Extensions.",
    "The roof alteration/extensions, by reason of its siting in this open prominent position and the size, scale, bulk and design of the rear dormer window would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original semi-detached dwelling, would be detrimental to the character, appearance and symmetry of the pair of semi-detached houses of which it forms a part and to the visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies BE13, BE15 and BE19 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Unitary Development Plan Saved Policies (November 2012) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document HDAS: Residential Extensions.",
    "The proposed new dwelling, by virtue of the siting of the first floor rear bedroom window, would be detrimental to the amenities of the adjoining occupier at 7 Aintree Close by reason of overlooking and loss of privacy. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to policies BE19, BE21 and BE24 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Saved UDP Policies (November 2012) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Documents HDAS: Residential Layouts and  HDAS: Residential Extensions.",
