  "description": "Single storey rear extension, first floor rear extension and conversion of existing garage to habitable use for use as an annexe/office.",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed first floor rear extension, by reason of its design, siting, width, scale, and bulk would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original semi-detached dwelling, would be detrimental to the character, appearance and symmetry of the pair of semi-detached houses of which it forms a part, would be detrimental to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 1, DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), and the National Planning Policy Framework (2019)."
