  "description": "ERECTION OF A TWO STOREY PART SIDE/ REAR AND SINGLE STOREY PART REAR EXTENSION AND CONVERSION OF ROOFSPACE TO HABITABLE USE INVOLVING INSTALLATION OF A REAR DORMER.",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed two storey side extension, by reason of its size, siting, excessive width, subordinate and angled raised crown roof design, fenestration details, would represent an incongruous addition to the side of this terraced house, detracting from the architectural composition of the original house and terrace, thereby unbalancing its appearance. It would fail to preserve or enhance the character and appearance of this part of the Hayes Village Conservation Area. The proposal would therefore be contrary to BE4, BE13, BE15 and BE19 of the Hillingdon Unitary Development Plan Saved Policies (September 2007) and section 5.0 of the Hillingdon Design & Accessibility Statement (HDAS): \"Residential Extensions\".",
