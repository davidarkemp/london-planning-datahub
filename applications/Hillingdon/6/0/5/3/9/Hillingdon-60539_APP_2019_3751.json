    "The proposed single storey side extension, by reason of its siting in this very prominent location, size, scale, bulk, orientation to the road and projection forward of the building line along Hanover Circle, is considered to represent an unduly intrusive and incongruous form of development which would be detrimental to the visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB11 and DMHD1 of the Hillingddon Local Plan - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The roof alteration/extensions, by reason of the hip to gable end roof design and siting, size, scale, bulk and design of the rear dormer, and half hipped roof form of the rear extension, would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original dwelling, the character, appearance and symmetry of the pair of semi-detached houses of which it forms a part and the visual amenities of the street scene and the wider area. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB11 and DMHD1 of the Hillingddon Local Plan - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies Local Plan Part , Local Plan - Development Management Policies, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service. This is a resubmission of a previously refused scheme, where the Inspectors Report identified issues to be addressed, which were reflected in the reasons for refusal, allowing the opportunity to address those issues within this submission."
