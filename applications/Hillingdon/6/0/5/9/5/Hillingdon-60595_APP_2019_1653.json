  "description": "Proposed telecommunications removal and replacement",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed telecommunications mast installation by reason of its excessive height, scale, design and location would be an incongruous and visually obtrusive form of development, thereby resulting in a detrimental impact on the character and appearance of the street scene and surrounding area. Furthermore, the proposed cabinets, by reason of their size, siting and design would add undue clutter to the detriment of the visual amenity of the street scene. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies BE13 and BE37 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Saved UDP Policies (November 2012).",
    "The proposed development, by virtue of its size, scale and proximity would be detrimental to the amenities of the adjoining occupiers at 590 Field End Road by reason of visual intrusion. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to policy BE21 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Saved UDP Policies (November 2012).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Unitary Development Plan Saved Policies (September 2007) as incorporated into the Hillingdon Local Plan (2012) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan - The Spatial Development Strategy for London consolidated with alterations since 2011 (2016) and national guidance."
