    "The proposed conversion of the existing three-bedroom single dwelling at number 99 Laburnum Road into 1 x one-bedroom flat and 1 x two-bedroom flat would result in the loss of a residential unit that is suitable for a family. The proposal would therefore unacceptably undermine the supply of family housing within the Borough, contrary to Policies DMH 1, DMH 2 and DMH 4 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy H10 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The proposed part two storey, part single storey rear extension, by virtue of its proximity, size, scale, bulk, depth and height, would be detrimental to the residential amenities of the neighbouring occupiers at number 101 Laburnum Road, in terms of loss of light, loss of outlook, sense of enclosure and overbearing impact. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1of the  Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The proposed development, by virtue of its failure to demonstrate an adequate provision of private external amenity space, would be detrimental to the living conditions of future occupiers. The proposal would therefore be conflict with Policy DMHB 18 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 - Development Management Policies (2020) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan - The Spatial Development Strategy for London consolidated with alterations since 2011 (2016) and national guidance.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "a) We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
