    "The proposed single storey side extension in conjunction with the current side extension, by reason of its prominent siting, cumulative and combined height, depth and width, design, bulk and massing would result in an awkward, incongruous, disproportionate, visually intrusive and excessively wide addition that would harm the architectural composition of the original dwelling, relationship with no.50 Lynhurst Crescent of which it forms part to, character and appearance of the area and visual amenities of this prominent streetscene. Therefore, the proposal would be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012) and Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2016). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020."
