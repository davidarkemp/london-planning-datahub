  "description": "Part two storey part single storey rear extension and single storey front extension.",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed part two storey part single storey rear extension, by reason of its size, design and siting, would result in an overly dominant feature that would overshadow the adjoining property at No. 32 Minet Drive. It would result in a visually intrusive and an un-neighbourly form of development that would result in a loss of light and a loss of residential amenity. Therefore, the proposal would be contrary to Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan - Part Two (2020).",
    "The proposed development by reason of the location of the proposed side facing window to bedroom 3 would result in the direct overlooking of No. 32 Minet Drive, causing an unacceptable loss of privacy to the occupiers.Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan - Part Two (2020).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
