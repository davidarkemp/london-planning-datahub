    "The proposed development, by virtue of its design and siting and footprint, results in a cramped overdevelopment of the site and a loss of the open space and landscape character, which fails to harmonise with the existing pattern of development. The proposal is also likely to result in damage and removal of existing trees within and adjoining the site, and would therefore result in a detrimental impact to the visual amenities of the site and the character of the area. As such, the proposal is contrary to Policies BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 (2012), and Policies DMH 6, DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHB 14 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 (2020), Policy D6 of the London Plan and Chapter 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023).",
    "The application submission fails to fully demonstrate that the proposal would not give rise to adverse impacts upon the highway network to the detriment of traffic congestion, parking stress and highway safety. Based on the information submitted, the proposed development is considered to have an unacceptable impact on highway safety. As such, the proposal is contrary to Policies DMT 1 and DMT 2 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 (2020), and Policies T2, T4 and T5 of the London Plan (2021), and is refused in accordance with paragraph 111 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023).",
    "In the absence of a robust Tree Survey and Arboricultural Impact Assessment, the application has failed to demonstrate that the development will safeguard existing trees within and adjacent to the site for long-term retention. Accordingly, the development could result in adverse and irreversible impacts to landscaping, trees, biodiversity or other natural features of merit, contrary to Section 15 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023) and Policies DMH 6, DMHB 11 and DMHB 14 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 (2020).",
    "The proposed unit mix fails to provide sufficient family sized units, as required by the latest information on housing need in the Borough. The proposed development fails to contribute towards mixed and balanced communities and the range of housing types required within the Borough contrary to Policy DMH 2 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 (2020), Policy H10 of the London Plan (2021) and Sections 4 and 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023).",
    "The proposed development would likely contribute to the production of unacceptable pollutant emissions in the Hillingdon Air Quality Management Area and the Uxbridge Road Air Quality Focus Area. In the absence of an Air Quality Assessment, it is not possible to ascertain the full measure of transport emissions into the atmosphere and whether the proposed development would be air quality neutral. Further, the proposed development is not air quality positive and there are insufficient measures proposed to mitigate the total emissions. As such, the development is contrary to Policy EM8 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 (2012), Policy DMEI 14 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 (2020), Policy SI 1 of the London Plan (2021) and paragraphs 174(e) and 186 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023).",
    "The Applicant has failed to secure Section 106 planning obligations required to mitigate the harm and demands created by the development in respect of air quality. The development therefore conflicts with Policy DMCI 7 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 (2020), the adopted Planning Obligations Supplementary Planning Document (2014), Policy DF1 of the London Plan (2021), and paragraphs 55-57 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service. We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal.",
    "This is a reminder that Under the terms of the Planning Act 2008 (as amended) and Community Infrastructure Levy Regulations 2010 (as amended), should an application for appeal be allowed, the proposed development would be deemed as 'chargeable development' and therefore liable to pay the London Borough of Hillingdon Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and the Mayor of London's Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This would be calculated in accordance with the London Borough of Hillingdon CIL Charging Schedule 2014 and the Mayor of London's CIL Charging Schedule 2012.",
