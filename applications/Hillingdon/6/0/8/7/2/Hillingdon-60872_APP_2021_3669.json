  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed part two storey, part single storey side extension, by reason of its size, scale, design and proximity to the side boundary, would result in a closing of the visually open gap between it and the neighbouring property, 38 Raleigh Avenue, giving rise to a cramped form of development and possible terracing effect, which would be detrimental to the visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area generally. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), policies DMHB11; DMHB12 and DMHD1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan - Part Two (2020) and policies D3 and D8 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
