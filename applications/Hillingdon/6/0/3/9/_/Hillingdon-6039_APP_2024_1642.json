    "Insufficient information has been submitted with regards to the appearance of the proposed External Lighting, Hard Landscaping, Refuse and Cycle Storage in order to ensure that the proposed development will preserve and enhance the visual amenities of the locality and provide adequate facilities in compliance with policies DMHB 11, DMHB 14, DMEI 1 and DMT 6 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 (2020). Furthermore, the details submitted indicate the proposal of a ramped access to the proposed Scout Hut which was not approved under the original application (ref. 6039/APP/2021/3465). This is a fundamental amendment to the scheme which requires planning permission. As such permission cannot be granted. The application is recommended for refusal.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably. In addition further guidance was offered to the applicant by the case officer during the processing of the application to identify the amendments to address those elements of the scheme considered unacceptable which the applicant chose not to implement."
