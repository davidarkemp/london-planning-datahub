    "The proposed extensionsl, by reason of their combined and excessive scale, design, bulk, width, and siting would result in an overdevelopment of the site which would fail to appear subordinate to the host property, harming the original design and appearance of the dwelling and failing to preserve or enhance the character and appearance of the Conservation Area. Therefore, the proposal fails to comply with Policies HE1 and BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHD 1, DMHB 4, DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021) and Chapter 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The proposal, by reason of its overall size, height, bulk, design and proximity to the boundary, would be detrimental to the residential amenities of the adjoining occupiers at Numbers 59a and 61a Kingsend by reason of loss of light, privacy, over dominance and overbearing effect. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policies DMHB11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan - Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2021). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020."
