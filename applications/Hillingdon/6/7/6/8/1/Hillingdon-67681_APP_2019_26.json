    "The roof alteration/extensions, by reason of the size, scale, bulk and design of the side dormer window would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original dwelling, would be detrimental to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the street scene and would fail to either preserve or enhance the character or appearance of the surrounding Ruislip Village Conservation Area. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies BE1 and HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies BE4, BE13, BE15 and BE19 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Saved UDP Policies (November 2012), Policy 7.8 of the London Plan (2016), the adopted Supplementary Planning Document HDAS: Residential Extensions and the NPPF.",
    "The proposed development, by virtue of the position of the side facing window, would be detrimental to the amenities of the adjoining occupier at 24 Manor Road, by reason of overlooking and loss of privacy. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to policies BE21 and BE24 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Saved UDP Policies (November 2012) and the Council's adopted Supplementary Planning Document HDAS: Residential Extensions",
    "In order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably. In addition further guidance was offered to the applicant by the case officer during the processing of the application to identify the amendments to address those elements of the scheme considered unacceptable. One revised plan was received and  further consultation was undertaken prior to determination. However, the second amendments required to make the application acceptable are substantial and would materially change the development proposal. They would require further consultation to be undertaken prior to determination which could not take place within the statutory determination period specified by the Department of Communities and Local Government. You are therefore encouraged to consider the submission of a fresh application incorporating the material amendments set out below which are necessary to make the scheme acceptable."
