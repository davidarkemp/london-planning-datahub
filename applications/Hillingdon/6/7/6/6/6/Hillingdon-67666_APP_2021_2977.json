    "The proposed development, by reason of the number, size and siting of vehicles, the expected vehicle movements in and out of the site and the 24-hour use of the site, would not preserve the openness of the Green Belt and would constitute inappropriate development within designated Green Belt land. Very special circumstances have not been sufficiently evidenced in order to outweigh the harm to the Green Belt by reason of inappropriateness. As such, the proposal is contrary to Policy EM2 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 (2012), Policy DMEI 4 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 (2020), Policy G2 of the London Plan (2021) and Paragraphs 147 to 150 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The on-site parking arrangements (including vehicles parked to the West of the site), results in a detrimental impact on the street scene and visual amenities of the area, contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 (2012), Policy DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 (2020), Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021), paragraph 130 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021) and the National Design Guide (2021).",
    "Insufficient information has been submitted to demonstrate that the proposed use would avoid significant adverse impacts on the health and quality of life of neighbouring residents, contrary to Policy EM8 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 (2012), Policy DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 (2020), Policy D14 of the London Plan (2021) and paragraph 130 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The location of the entrance gates, just 13 metres from the public highway, would result in large vehicles overhanging onto Sipson Road when they are closed. As such, the proposal creates a use with a layout which would be prejudicial to the free-flow of traffic and the safety of all highway users, contrary to Policies DMT 1 and DMT 2 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 (2020), Policy T4 of the London Plan (2021), and paragraphs 110 and 112 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The applicant has failed to secure Section 106 planning obligations required as a consequence of demands created by the proposed development (in respect of air quality, travel planning, project management and monitoring). The scheme therefore conflicts with Policy DMCI 7 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2 (2020); the adopted Planning Obligations Supplementary Planning Document (2014); Policy DF1 of the London Plan (2021); and paragraphs 55-57 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan (2021) and national guidance.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably. In addition further guidance was offered to the applicant by the case officer during the processing of the application to identify the amendments to address those elements of the scheme considered unacceptable which the applicant chose not to implement."
