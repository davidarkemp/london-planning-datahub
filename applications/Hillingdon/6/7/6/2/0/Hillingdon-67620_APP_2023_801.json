    "The proposed front porch extension, by reason of its cumulative size, scale, bulk, height and design when viewed together with the existing heavily developed building, would represent an incongruous form of development which would be detrimental to the architectural composition of the existing building and would fail to harmonise with the local context on Frays Avenue to the detriment of the visual amenities of the street scene and the character and appearance of the wider area. The proposed development is therefore contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 5, DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2016). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020."
