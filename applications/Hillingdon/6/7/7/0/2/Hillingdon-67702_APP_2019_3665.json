    "REASON",
    "To ensure the development complies with the provisions of the  Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and the London Plan (2016).",
    "Any apparatus or structure provided in accordance with this approval shall be removed from the land, as soon as reasonably practicable after it is no longer required for electronic communications purposes, and such land, shall be restored to its condition before the development took place, or to any other condition as may be agreed in writing with the Local Planning Authority.",
    "REASON",
    "To ensure that the development is removed as soon as it is no longer required in order to protect the character and appearance of the area in accordance with Policies DMHB 11 and DMB21 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The decision to GRANT planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to GRANT planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) set out below and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan - The Spatial Development Strategy for London consolidated with alterations since 2011 (2016) and national guidance.",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant saved policies (referred to as policies from the Hillingdon Unitary Development Plan - Saved Policies September 2007), then London Plan Policies (2016).  On the 8th November 2012 Hillingdon's Full Council agreed the adoption of the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies. Appendix 5 of this explains which saved policies from the old Unitary Development (which was subject to a direction from Secretary of State in September 2007 agreeing that the policies were 'saved') still apply for development control decisions."
