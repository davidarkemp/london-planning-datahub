    "The proposed extension, by virtue of its size, scale, bulk and depth would be detrimental to the amenities of the adjoining occupiers at Nos. 179 and 183 Torcross Road, by reason of overdominance, visual intrusion and loss of outlook. Therefore, the proposal would be contrary to Policy BE21 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Saved UDP Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the emerging Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies with Modifications (March 2019) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document HDAS: Residential Extensions.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the 'Saved' UDP 2007, Local Plan Part 1, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "The applicant is advised that the proposed plans are inconsistent in terms of the projection forward of the side extension shown on the Proposed Block Plan (Drw. No. 05) as compared to the Proposed Plan (Drw. No. 03) and the Proposed Side Elevations (Drw. No. 04). For the purposes of this determination, the side extension shown in Drw. Nos. 03 and 04 has been taken as being correct."
