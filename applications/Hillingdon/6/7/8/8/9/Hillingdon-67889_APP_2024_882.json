    "The proposed single storey rear extension, by virtue of its excessive scale, depth and design would result in an incongruous addition which would be detrimental to the architectural composition of the existing building as well as the character and appearance of the wider area contrary to the requirements of Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies (November 2012),  Policies DMHB11; DMHB12 and DMHD1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan - Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and Policy D4 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "The proposed single storey rear extension, by virtue of its excessive depth, would appear as an over-dominant addition to the application property and would have an overbearing impact on the residential amenity of 128 and 132 The Fairway. The proposal thereby fails to comply with Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to /REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan - The Spatial Development Strategy for London consolidated with alterations since 2011 (2016) and national guidance."
