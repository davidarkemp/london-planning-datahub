    "The proposed redevelopment of the building, by reason of its scale, bulk, massing and poor quality of design (including the proposed front dormers and double storey extension to the rear)  would fail to appear as a subordinate addition and  as such would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original building. It would be detrimental to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the street scene and would fail to either preserve or enhance the character or appearance of the surrounding Ruislip Village Conservation Area.Overall the proposed development would therefore cause less than substantial harm to the conservation area, as well as harm to the host building. The less than substantial harm caused to the Conservation Area would not be outweighed by public benefits. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies, Policies DMHB 1, DMHB 4, DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two",
    "The proposed development, by virtue of the position of the windows serving flat 4, would be detrimental to the amenities of the adjoining occupier at No 63A High Street by reason of overlooking and loss of privacy. Due to the position of the windows and their close proximity to the mentioned neighbouring property, the proposed development would cause excessive overlooking and a significant loss of privacy to the detriment of the mentioned neighbours amenities and living conditions. The proposal is therefore considered to be contrary to Policies DMHB 11, of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021), and paragraph 135 (f) of the NPPF (2023).",
    "The proposal would result in the provision of habitable rooms within the roofspace of Flat 2 which would be single aspect with limited levels of outlook, natural light/sunlight and ventilation.Due to its undersized dormers and single aspect design, it is considered that the residents of flat 2 would receive poor levels of natural light and outlook. Additionally in the absence of external amenity space it is considered that the new residental units  would result in a substandard form of living accommodation to the detriment of the amenity of future occupiers. The proposal is therefore considered to be contrary to Policy DMHB 18 of the Local Plan, Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021), and paragraph 135 (f) of the NPPF (2023).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan (2021) and NPPF (2023).",
    "This is a reminder that Under the terms of the Planning Act 2008 (as amended) and Community Infrastructure Levy Regulations 2010 (as amended), should an application for appeal be allowed, the proposed development would be deemed as 'chargeable development' and therefore liable to pay the London Borough of Hillingdon Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and the Mayor of London's Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This would be calculated in accordance with the London Borough of Hillingdon CIL Charging Schedule 2014 and the Mayor of London's CIL Charging Schedule 2012.",
