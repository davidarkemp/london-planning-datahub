    "The resultant development, by reason of the cumulative size, scale, bulk, and massing of the existing and proposed extensions, together with its crown roofed design, would result in a visually dominant and incongruous form of development that fails to harmonise with the architectural composition of the host dwelling and terrace in which it sits to the detriment of the character, appearance, and visual amenities of the surrounding area. The proposed development therefore conflicts with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies D1, D3, D4 of The London Plan (2021), Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One Strategic Policies (2012), and Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The proposed first-floor side/rear extension, by reason of its size, design, and proximity, would result in an overly dominant feature that would unduly overshadow the adjoining properties at 10 and 14 Wesley Road and, as such, would result in a visually intrusive and an un-neighbourly form of development, resulting in a loss of light, and material loss of residential amenity. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021) and  Policies DMHD 1 and DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan - Part Two (2020).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service."
