  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed first floor side/rear extension  by virtue of its cumulative bulk, size, scale,  gabled roof design, and proximity to the side boundary in this open prominent position, would result in the closing of an important gap characteristic to the area and a cramped appearance which would fail to read as subordinate or successfully harmonise with the architectural composition of the original semi-detached dwelling. The proposed development is therefore contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11  and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020) and Policy D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "The proposed first floor side/rear extension, by virtue of  its siting, cumulative scale and bulk would give rise to an unacceptable loss of outlook, overbearing impact, visual intrusion and sense of enclosure to the occupiers at 52 Wentworth Crescent causing harm to residential amenity. Therefore, the proposal would be contrary to Policies D3 and D6 of the London Plan (2021) and Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
