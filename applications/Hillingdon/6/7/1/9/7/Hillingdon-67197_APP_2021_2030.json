    "The proposed extension, in particular the front wrap around and forward projection element, by reason of its combined height, depth, width, roof form and general siting would result in an incongruous, dominant and visually intrusive addition that would substantially harm the form, proportion and appearance of the dwelling, the character and appearance of the area and visual amenities of the streetscene. Therefore, the proposal would be contrary to Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
