    "The proposed development, by reason of its cumulative width, size, scale, bulk and design, would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original properties and would be detrimental to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the surrounding area. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "The proposed layout, in particular, Bedroom 2 for Nos. 18 and 20 Wilmar Close at first floor, would fail to provide an adequate outlook and natual light resulting in poor quality and substandard accommodation for future occupiers of the dwellings. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy DMHB 11 and 16 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020) as well as Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "In order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably. In addition further guidance was offered to the applicant by the case officer during the processing of the application to identify the amendments to address those elements of the scheme considered unacceptable which the applicant chose not to implement."
