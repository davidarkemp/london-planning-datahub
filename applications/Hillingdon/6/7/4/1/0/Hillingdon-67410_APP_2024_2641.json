    "The proposed development, by reason of the provision of facilities within the outbuilding and independent access to the outbuilding, would be tantamount to the creation of separate self-contained residential units in a position where such dwellings would be unacceptable. Consequently, the proposed development would harm the area's character and appearance and the amenity of neighbouring residents. The proposal is, therefore, contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2024), Policies D1, D3, D4, and D6 of the London Plan (2021), and Policies DMH 6, DMHD 2, and DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan - The Spatial Development Strategy for London consolidated with alterations since 2011 (2016) and national guidance."
