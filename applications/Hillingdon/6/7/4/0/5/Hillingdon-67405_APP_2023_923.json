    "The proposed two storey side extension, by reason of its design, size, scale and bulk, and particular proximity to No. 14 Thornton Avenue would result in an incongruous and cramped form of development that would not appear as a subordinate addition to the original dwellinghouse and would be detrimental to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the street scene and surrounding area. The proposed development would also be an over development of the site, contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHD 1, DMHB 1, DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021) and Chapter 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The proposed two storey side extension, by virtue of their size, scale, bulk, depth and proximity, would result in an unneighbourly development detrimental to the amenities of the adjacent occupiers of 14 Thornton Avenue by reason of visual intrusion, enclosure, overbearing impact, and overdominance. Therefore, the proposal would be contrary to Policies DMHD 1 and DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021)."
