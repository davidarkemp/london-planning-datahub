    "The use of the outbuilding hereby confirmed as approved is for the purposes stated on the application form as ancillary accommodation as a home gym. Future use of the outbuilding for purposes such as a bedroom, kitchen, or as a separate unit of accommodation constitutes a primary use that is not incidental and likely to invalidate this certificate. Furthermore, the Local Planning Authority may pursue enforcement against breaches of planning control, which may involve legal action through the Courts"
