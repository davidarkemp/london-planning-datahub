    "The combination of the proposed development and existing extensions by reason of their size, width, design, siting and proximity to the side boundary would cumulatively result in an insubordinate and visually incongruous, cramped form of development that would be detrimental to the character and appearance of the original property, surrounding area and would therefore fail to preserve or enhance the Harlington Village Conservation Area. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy BE1 and HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2021), Policies DMHB 4, DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management (2020), Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021) and Chapter 12 and 16 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service."
