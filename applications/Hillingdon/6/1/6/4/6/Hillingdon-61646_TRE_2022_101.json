    "The Oak is situated within the garden of 277 Swakeleys Road. Swakeleys Road is a main trunk road through the borough and as a result this Oak has a high amenity value. It significantly contributes to the Arboricultural Character of the area.",
    "The reason supplied by the applicant is \"to maintain size\" however it is not believed that the Oak is an inappropriate size for its location. Furthermore, a reduction by 20-25% will create multiple pruning wounds throughout the canopy, which would likely cause stress and lead to infection, affecting its long-term health; this would affect the safe useful life expectancy of the tree. Pruning would also result in weakly attached re-growth forming that would be prone to future failure.",
    "Having regard to the reasons given for the proposed work, the work is unjustified and will have a detrimental impact on the visual amenity and arboreal character of the area.",
    "The removal of deadwood, dangerous / hanging branches and ivy:  This does not require the formal consent of the Council."
