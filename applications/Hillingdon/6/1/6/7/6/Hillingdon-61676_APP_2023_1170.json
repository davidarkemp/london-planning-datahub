    "The proposal by reason of the proximity and position of the proposed crossover, has failed to demonstrate that the development will safeguard the protection and long term retention of the existing street tree which contributes positively to the local landscape character of the area. The proposal would, thus, result in harm to and potential loss of the tree to the detriment of the character and appearance of the street scene and the wider area contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHB 14 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two- Development Management Policies (2020), Policies G1 and G7 of the London Plan (2021) and Chapter 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The proposal by reason of the loss of the grass verge and front boundary wall and addition of hard landscaping of the front garden, which are attractive features on this part of Victoria Road, would be detrimental to the visual amenity and character of the street scene, in which it would set, by creating an open parking area, undefined boundary between the public and private domain and emphasising the appearance of an excessively hard surfaced area. The proposals is thus, contrary to Policies BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHHB 14 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020) and the Council's 'Domestic Vehicle Footway Crossover' Policy (2022) and Policies DMT 1 and DMT2 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policies D3 and G1 of the London Plan (2021) and Chapter 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The proposed front parking space would be of insufficient dimensions to accommodate a vehicle and by reason of inadequate manoeuvring details would likely result in undesirable turning movements over the pavement in and out of the site. This would result in risk of harm to highway safety for all users (pedestrian, cyclist and vehicle users), contrary to the Council's 'Domestic Vehicle Footway Crossover' Policy (2022), Policies DMT 1 and DMT2 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), and Policy T4 of the London Plan (2021)."
