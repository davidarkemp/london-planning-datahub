  "description": "Single storey side and part two storey, part single storey rear extension",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed part two storey/part single storey rear extension, by reason of its size, scale, bulk and design, would appear as a disproportionate and incongruous addition that would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original dwelling, and would be detrimental to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the area and would fail to either preserve or enhance the character or appearance of the surrounding Ruislip, Manor Way Conservation Area. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies BE1 and HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 1, DMHB 4, DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), Policy 7.8 of the London Plan (2016) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2019).",
    "The proposed single storey side extension, by reason of its siting, size and design, would appear as a discordant and unsympathetic addition that would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original building, would be detrimental to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the street scene and would fail to either preserve or enhance the character or appearance of the surrounding Ruislip, Manor Way Conservation Area. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies BE1 and HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 1, DMHB 4, DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), Policy 7.8 of the London Plan (2016) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2019).",
    "The proposed part two storey/part single storey rear extension, by virtue of its scale, bulk, height and proximity, would have a harmful impact on the living conditions and external amenity space of the occupiers at number 3 Almond Avenue, in terms of loss of outlook, overdominance and overbearing effect. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policies DMHD 1 and DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020) and the National Planning Policy Framework (February 2019).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2016). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020."
