    "The proposed development, in combination with the existing extensions,  by reason of the cumulative size, scale, bulk, width, and crown roofed design would be an overly-dominant and incongruous development which would be detrimental to the architectural composition of the original dwelling and to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the surrounding area. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the adopted Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "The proposed extension, by virtue of its size, scale, bulk, height, width and proximity, would be detrimental to the amenities of the neighbouring occupiers at No. 32 St Marys Road, by reason of over-dominance, overshadowing, visual intrusion, loss of light and loss of outlook. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the adopted Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
