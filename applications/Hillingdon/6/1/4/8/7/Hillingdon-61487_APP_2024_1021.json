    "The proposed development, in combination with the existing extensions, by reason of the cumulative size, scale, bulk, width, and crown roofed design would be an overly-dominant and incongruous development which would be detrimental to the architectural composition of the original dwelling and the character, appearance, and visual amenities of the surrounding area. Therefore, the proposal would be contrary to Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021), Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012) and Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The proposed extension, by virtue of its size, scale, bulk, height, width, and proximity, would be detrimental to the amenities of the neighbouring occupiers at 32 St Marys Road by reason of over-dominance, overshadowing, visual intrusion, loss of light, and loss of outlook. Therefore, the proposal would be contrary to policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the adopted Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "In dealing with the application, the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the 'Saved' UDP 2007, Local Plan Part 1, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service. This is a resubmission of a previously refused scheme, where the Officer's Report identified issues to be addressed, which were reflected in the reasons for refusal, allowing the opportunity to address those issues within this submission.",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020), including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan (2021) and national guidance."
