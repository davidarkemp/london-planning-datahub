    "The change of use of 16C High Street from Use Class E(a) to Use Class E(d) is permitted development as set out in the Town and Country Planning (Use Classes) Order 1987 (as amended). Associated internal works are lawful under Section 55(2) of the Town and Country Planning Act (1990). On balance, it is accepted the unit has previously been used for retail (Use Class E(a)) for 10 years. The proposed development is, therefore, lawful.",
    "It should be noted that whilst the proposed works are lawful, odour and noise emission associated with the proposed change of use must comply with the restrictions set out in the Environmental Protection Act 1990 (and other relevant legislation),  in order to protect the public and nearby occupiers from unacceptable and harmful levels of noise or odour emission."
