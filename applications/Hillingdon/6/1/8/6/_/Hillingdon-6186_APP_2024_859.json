    "The proposed single storey rear/side extension, by virtue of its excessive scale, bulk, depth and design would result in an incongruous addition which would be detrimental to the architectural composition of the existing building, the character and appearance of the wider area and the street scene contrary to the requirements of Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies (November 2012),  Policies DMHB11; DMHB12 and DMHD1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan - Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and Policy D4 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "The proposed side and rear extension, by virtue of the overall size, bulk and scale, and the close proximity to the shared side boundary, would appear as an over-dominant addition to the application property and would have an overbearing impact on the residential amenity of 98 Campden Road. The proposal thereby fails to comply with Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020)."
