  "decision_conditions": [
    "Due to its excessive width, size, bulk, two storey wrap around design, and incongruous roof form, the proposed extension would form a disproportionate and overly dominant addition to the host dwelling which would fail to respect its original size or architectural composition, subsequently causing harm to its character and appearance. Furthermore due to the design and prominent corner plot location of the extension, the resulting property would appear unduly prominent and overdeveloped when viewed from the Pillions Lane, causing significant harm to the character and appearance of the surrounding area. The proposed development is therefore considered to be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHD 1, DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020) and paragraphs 135 (a) and (c) of the NPPF (2023)."
