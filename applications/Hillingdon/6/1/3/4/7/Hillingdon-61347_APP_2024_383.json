    "Due to its its siting, height, bulk, scale, layout, and site coverage, and the resultant loss of rear garden space, the proposed development would result in an cramped, uncharacteristic and oversized form of development which would fail to harmonise with the urban grain and character of the surrounding area. The proposal is therefore considered to be detrimental to the visual amenity and character of the surrounding area, contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies, Policies DMH 6, DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policies D1, D3 and D6 of the London Plan (2021), as well as paragraphs 72, 128 and 135 of the NPPF (2023).",
    "Due to its orientation and close proximity to No.16 Hilliards Road, the rear habitable room windows and garden of the new dwelling would be severely overlooked. The lack of privacy to habitable internal and external spaces would create a poor and unsatisfactory living environment for future residents of the dwelling, to the detriment of their amenities. The proposed development would therefore be contrary to paragraph 135 (f) of the NPPF (2023) and Policy D6 of the London (2021).",
    "Due to its close proximity to the rear living room window of No.2 Hilliards Road, the new northern boundary fence/treatment would cause a signficant loss of light and outlook to the habitable space, creating a unsatisfactory and poor living environment for existing and future residents of No.2, to the detriment of their amenities. The proposed development would therefore be contrary to Policy DMH 6 and DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two (2020), as well as paragraph 135 (f) of the NPPF (2023).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan - The Spatial Development Strategy for London consolidated with alterations since 2011 (2016) and national guidance.",
    "This is a reminder that Under the terms of the Planning Act 2008 (as amended) and Community Infrastructure Levy Regulations 2010 (as amended), should an application for appeal be allowed, the proposed development would be deemed as 'chargeable development' and therefore liable to pay the London Borough of Hillingdon Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and the Mayor of London's Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This would be calculated in accordance with the London Borough of Hillingdon CIL Charging Schedule 2014 and the Mayor of London's CIL Charging Schedule 2012.",
