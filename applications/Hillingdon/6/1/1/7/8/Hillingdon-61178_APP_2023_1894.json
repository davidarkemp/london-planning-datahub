    "The proposed two storey side / rear extension, by virtue of its design, scale, size, bulk and massing, would fail to read as a subordinate addition to the host building and appear as an incongruous addition within the wider area, failing to comply with Policies DMHD1, DMHB11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two (2020).",
    "The proposal would result in a habitable room, shown as a dining room on the ground floor, to be fully enclosed with no outlook. It is considered this would result in poor living conditions for the current and future occupiers of the property, contrary to Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021)."
