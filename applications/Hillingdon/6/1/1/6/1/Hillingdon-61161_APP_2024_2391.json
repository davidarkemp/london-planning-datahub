    "The proposed part two-storey, part single storey side/rear extension by reason of scale, siting and design, would result in an excessive and disproportionate form of development that would disrupt the visual relationship with adjoining sites. As such, the development would fail to be seen as a subordinate form of development that would not be in keeping with the scale and form of the semi-detached formation and it would have a detrimental impact on the character and appearance of the host property and on the visual amenity of the street scene and surrounding residential area. The development would therefore be contrary to Policy D4 of the London Plan (2021), Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11 and DHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.",
    "In order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably. In addition further guidance was offered to the applicant by the case officer during the processing of the application to identify the amendments to address those elements of the scheme considered unacceptable which the applicant chose not to implement."
