  "description": "Conversion of roofspace to habitable use to include a side dormer, a rear dormer, Juliette balcony and 2 x front rooflights and porch to front with alterations to fenestration.",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed side and rear dormers, by reason of their design, siting, size, bulk and massing, would fail to respect the original roof form and architectural composition of the host dwelling, resulting in the loss of symmetry with the attached neighbouring property at number 96 Catlins Lane, and would be harmful to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the street scene and the Raisins Hill Area of Special Local Character. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policies BE1 and HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 1, DMHB 5, DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), Policy 7.8 of the London Plan (2016) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2019).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2016). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020."
