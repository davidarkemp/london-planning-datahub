    "The proposed single-storey side/rear extension, by reason of its combined siting, bulk, massing, height, width, depth, and design, would result in an excessive, bulky, dominant, overbearing, and visually intrusive form of development that would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original dwelling, would be detrimental to the character, appearance, and symmetry of the immediate detached properties and context of which it forms a part and to the visual amenities of the surrounding area. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012) and Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The proposed single-storey side/rear extension, by reason of its combined siting, bulk, massing, height, width, and depth, would be detrimental to the amenities of the adjacent occupiers at 55 Kewferry Road, causing overdominance, visual intrusion, overbearing impact, and loss of outlook. As such, the proposal would be contrary to Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The applicant has failed to satisfactorily justify the loss of the adjacent Silver Birch tree, which is protected under Tree Preservation Order 114, or demonstrate adequate replacements would be planted based on the existing tree's value. The proposal is, therefore, detrimental to the existing tree of value and the visual amenity of the area, contrary to Policy G7 of The London Plan (2021), Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012) and Policy DMHB 11, DMHB 14, and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the Local Plan Part 1 and Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service. This application is a resubmission of a previously refused scheme, where the Officers Report identified issues to be addressed, which were reflected in the reasons for refusal, allowing the opportunity to address those issues within this submission."
