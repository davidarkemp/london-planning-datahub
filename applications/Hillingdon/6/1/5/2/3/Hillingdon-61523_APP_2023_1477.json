    "Due to its size, prominent siting, unsympathetic design, the proposed dwelling would form an uncharacteristic, cramped and visually incongruous form of development which would fail to harmonise with the established character of the area and appearance of the street scene. The proposal would therefore be detrimental to the visual amenities of the streetscene and character of the surrounding area, all contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies, Policies DMH 6, DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policies D1 and D3 of the London Plan (2021), as well as paragraphs 124 and 130 of the NPPF (2021).",
    "Due to its height, design and close proximity to No.73 Willow Tree Lane, the proposed dwelling would give rise to significant loss of outlook, overbearing effects and a degree of overlooking for No. 73 Willow Tree Lane, causing a unacceptable loss of privacy to its occupiers, which would harm their amenities.  The proposal is therefore considered to be contrary to policies DMHB 11 of the Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020) and paragraph 130 (f) of the NPPF (2021).",
    "The proposal fails to provide a step free access for the new dwelling and fails to meet the internal floorspace and layout standards set out in Diagram 27 of Approved Document M to the Building Regulations. The proposal is therefore considered to be contrary to Policy D7 A(2) of the London Plan, which requires all houses (which are created via works to which Part M volume 1 of the Building Regulations applies) meet Building Regulation requirement M4(2) 'accessible and adaptable dwellings'.",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan (2021)."
