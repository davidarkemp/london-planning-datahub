    "The proposed extension, by reason of its size, scale, bulk, excessive width and design would would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original dwelling, would accentuate the imbalance between the pair of semi-detached houses of which it forms a part and would be detrimental to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "The proposed extension, by reason of its size, scale, bulk, width and proximity to the side boundary, would result in a closing of the visually open gap between it and the neighbouring property, 38 Morello Avenue, giving rise to a cramped form of development, which would be detrimental to the visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area generally. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies."
