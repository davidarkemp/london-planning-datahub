  "description": "Two storey side extension with alterations to front elevation.",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed two storey side extension, by reason of its size, scale, bulk and design in relation to the proposed changes to the roof and the creation of a crown/flat roof element, would result in an incongruous form of development, which would fail to harmonise with the architecture of the host dwelling and would thus be detrimental to the appearance of the original house, the visual amenities of the street scene and the character and appearance of the wider area. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2016). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020."
