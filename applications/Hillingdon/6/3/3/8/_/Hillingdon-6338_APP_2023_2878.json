    "The proposed single storey rear extension, by reason of its excessive depth, scale and proximity to the shared boundary, would result in an overly dominant development that fails to appear subordinate to the dwelling, is incongruous with the prevailing pattern of development, resulting in harm to the appearance of the original dwelling and character of the area. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to policies DMHB11 and DMHD1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan - Part Two (2020), Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021) and Chapter 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023).",
    "The proposed single storey rear extension, by reason of its excessive depth and scale in proximity to the shared boundary, would result in an overly dominant development that would harm the residential amenities of No.269 Swakeleys Road, through loss of light to and outlook from this property, and through creating an overbearing sense of enclosure. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to policies DMHB11 and DMHD1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan - Part Two (2020).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service."
