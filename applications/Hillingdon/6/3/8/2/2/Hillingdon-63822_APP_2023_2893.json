    "The proposed development does not constitute permitted development by virtue of the provisions of Schedule 2, Part 1, Class A of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015, as the maximum height would exceed 4 metres contrary to provision A.1(g)(ii). Therefore the proposed height would exceed permitted development, and the development is therefore unlawful. In addition, the proposed development due to its depth, height and siting would cause unacceptable harm to the residential amenities of the neighbouring residence at No. 113 Southbourne Gardens. Accordingly, whilst the application is unlawful, prior approval would also have been required and refused."
