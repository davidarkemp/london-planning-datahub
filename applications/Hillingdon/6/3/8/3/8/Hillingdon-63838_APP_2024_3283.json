    "The proposed single-storey rear canopy, by reason of its cumulative size with the existing approved rear extension, poor quality design, and proximity to the shared boundary, would result in an overly dominant feature that is incongruous within the prevailing pattern of development, resulting in harm to the character and visual appearance of the dwelling and surrounding area. Therefore, the proposal would be contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2024), Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021), Policy BE 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One (2012), and Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The proposed single-storey rear canopy, by reason of its cumulative size with the existing approved rear extension, poor quality design, and proximity to the shared boundary, would harm the residential amenities of the adjoining neighbouring properties by creating an overbearing sense of enclosure, loss of light, and loss of outlook. Therefore, the proposal would be contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2024), Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021),  Policy BE 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One (2012), and Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",

    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan (2021) and national guidance."
