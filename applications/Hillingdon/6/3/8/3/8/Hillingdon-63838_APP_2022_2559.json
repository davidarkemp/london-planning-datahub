    "The proposed single storey rear canopy in conjunction with the single storey rear extension, by reason of its cumulative size, poor quality design and proximity to the shared boundary, would result in an overly dominant feature that is incongruous with the prevailing pattern of development, resulting in harm to the character of the area, and would harm the residential amenities of the adjoining properties at No. 13 and No. 17 Rushdene Road, through loss of light to and outlook from this property, and through creating an overbearing sense of enclosure. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to policies DMHB11 and DMHD1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan - Part Two (2020).",
    "The proposed front canopy, by virtue of its scale, design, siting and materials, would appear as an unduly prominent and unsympathetic addition to the host dwelling. It would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original semi-detached dwelling, would be detrimental to the character, appearance and symmetry of the pair of semidetached houses of which it forms a part, and result in harm to the visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policies DMHD 1 and DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021) and Chapter 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021)."
