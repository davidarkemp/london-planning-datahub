    "The proposed front canopy, by virtue of its scale, design, siting and materials, would appear as an unduly prominent and unsympathetic addition to the host dwelling. It would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original semi-detached dwelling, would be detrimental to the character, appearance, and symmetry of the pair of semi-detached houses of which it forms a part, and would result in harm to the visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area. The proposal would, therefore, be contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2024) and Policies DMHD 1, DMHB 11, and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan (2021) and national guidance."
