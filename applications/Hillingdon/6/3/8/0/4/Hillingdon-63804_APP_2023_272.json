    "The proposed front infill extension fails to read as a subordinate and visually sympathetic addition to the application dwelling and would result in a loss of consistency, symmetry and rhythm in the row of terraced properties. As a result the development harms the character and appearance of the application property, the terrace group of which it forms a part and the visual amenity of the street scene. Therefore the application is contrary to BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One Strategic (2012) and Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020).",
    "On this decision notice policies from the Councils Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies appear first, then relevant Local Plan Part 2 (2020), then London Plan Policies (2016). Hillingdon's Full Council adopted the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 1 - Strategic Policies on 8 November 2012 and the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 2 on 16 January 2020."
