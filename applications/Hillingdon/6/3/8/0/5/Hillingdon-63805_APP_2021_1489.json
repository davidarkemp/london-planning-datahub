    "The proposed dwelling on Plot 4, by reason of its siting in a rear garden, layout, site coverage and design, would result in a visually incongruous form of development that would disrupt the prevailing pattern of development within the local area. The principle of intensifying the residential use of the site, as well as the proposed loss of existing private rear garden space, would have a detrimental impact on the character and appearance of the area. The proposal would therefore be detrimental to the visual amenity and the character of the surrounding area, contrary to Policy BE 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One- Strategic Policies (2012), Policies DMH 6, DMHB 11, DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2- Development Management Policies (2020), Policies D1, D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The proposed development as a whole, by reason of its layout, the number of dwellings being proposed and their siting, scale, height and design (including the introduction of overly sized rear dormers), would result in a cramped, incongruous and visually obtrusive form of development. The proposal would therefore cause significant harm to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area. The proposal would therefore by contrary to Policy BE 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One- Strategic Policies (2012), Policies DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2- Development Management Policies (2020), Policies D1, D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The proposed development, by virtue of the proximity, siting, scale, bulk and height of the proposed dwelling on Plot 4, would cause a loss of outlook, loss of privacy, overshadowing and a sense of enclosure for the users of the existing private amenity space at number 15 Beech Avenue. The proposal would therefore be contrary to  Policy BE 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One- Strategic Policies (2012), Policy DMHB 11 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2- Development Management Policies (2020) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The proposed dwellings on Plots 1, 2 and 3, by virtue of their proximity, siting and orientation in relation to Plot 4, would result in a substandard form of internal residential accommodation for the future occupiers, in terms of poor outlook, poor levels of natural light, overshadowing, sense of enclosure and overbearing impact. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policy DMHB 16 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2- Development Management Policies (2020), Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The proposed development, by virtue of its failure to provide useable private amenity space of a sufficient size on Plot 2, and the inadequate quality of private amenity space on Plots 1, 2 and 3, in terms of poor outlook, overshadowing, sense of enclosure and overbearing impact,  would give rise to a substandard form of living accommodation to the detriment of the amenity of future occupiers. The proposal therefore conflicts with  Policy DMHB 18 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part 2- Development Management Policies (2020) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan - The Spatial Development Strategy for London consolidated with alterations since 2011 (2016) and national guidance.",
    "This is a reminder that Under the terms of the Planning Act 2008 (as amended) and Community Infrastructure Levy Regulations 2010 (as amended), should an application for appeal be allowed, the proposed development would be deemed as 'chargeable development' and therefore liable to pay the London Borough of Hillingdon Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and the Mayor of London's Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This would be calculated in accordance with the London Borough of Hillingdon CIL Charging Schedule 2014 and the Mayor of London's CIL Charging Schedule 2012.",
