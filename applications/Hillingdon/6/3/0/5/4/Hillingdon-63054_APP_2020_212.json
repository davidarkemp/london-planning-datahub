  "description": "Single storey front/side extension",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed front/side extension, by reason of its projection forward, size, scale, bulk and design, would fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original dwelling and, would be detrimental to the character, appearance and visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding Hillside, Northwood Hills Area of Special Local Character. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies BE1 and HE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012), Policies DMHB 1, DMHB 5, DMHB 11, DMHB 12 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020), Policy 7.8 of the London Plan (2016) and the NPPF.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the Hillingdon Local Plan - Part One (2012) and the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), as well as offering a full pre-application advice service. We have however been unable to seek solutions to problems arising from the application as the principal of the proposal is clearly contrary to our statutory policies and negotiation could not overcome the reasons for refusal."
