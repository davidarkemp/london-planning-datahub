    "By virtue of its proximity, depth, size, scale, bulk and height, the proposed single storey rear extension would cause unacceptable harm to the residential amenity of the occupants of the adjoining properties at numbers 7 and 9 Tanworth Close, in terms of loss of light, overshadowing, loss of outlook, sense of enclosure and overbearing impact. The proposed development is therefore contrary to Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021). Prior approval is therefore refused."
