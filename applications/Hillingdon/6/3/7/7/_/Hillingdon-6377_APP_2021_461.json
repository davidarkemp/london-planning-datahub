  "description": "Part two storey part single storey side extension and crossover to front.",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed extension by reason of its size, scale, bulk, height, depth, width and proximity to the side boundary, in this open prominent corner plot position, would result in the closing of an important gap characteristic to the area, resulting in a cramped appearance. The proposal would therefore represent an overdevelopment of the site to the detriment of the visual amenities of the street scene and the character and appearance of the surrounding area. The proposed development is therefore contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "The proposed two storey side extension, by virtue of its siting, size, scale, width and design, including the excessive width and crown roof design, would fail to appear as a subordinate addition and would thus fail to harmonise with the architectural composition of the original semi-detached dwelling, would be detrimental to the character, appearance and symmetry of the pair of semi-detached houses of which it forms a part and to the visual amenities of the street scene and the surrounding area. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020).",
    "The proximity of the proposed second vehicle access to the junction between Royal Lane and Bryony Close would increase the road safety risk to all road users and be contrary to Policy DMT 2 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (January 2020) and national planning guidance contained in the National Planning Policy Framework (Feb 2019)."
