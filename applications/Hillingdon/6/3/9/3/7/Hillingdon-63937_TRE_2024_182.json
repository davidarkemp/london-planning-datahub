    "The oak tree is situated to the rear of 28 Nicholas Way, and is set back from the road. Due to the location of the tree to the rear of the property and other surrounding vegetation, the view of the tree from outside the property is limited.",
    "Although the tree has a limited wider amenity value, it does help to contribute to the arboreal character of the Copse Wood Estate, and alongside other nearby trees forms a gradual transition of mature canopy cover from the nearby Ruislip Woods into the residential area. For this reason the tree has a moderate amenity value.",
    "This application has been refused on the grounds that not enough evidence has been provided to show that the tree is unstable or the ground is heaving.",
    "It is claimed that the tree is leaning towards the house and showing early signs of ground heaving. In our opinion, the images provided in this application does not support this claim, with only a minor lean visible and superficial ground cracks close to the base of the tree.",
    "The removal of deadwood, dangerous / hanging branches and ivy:  This does not require the formal consent of the Council.",
    "Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981:  Note that it is an offence under this act to disturb roosting bats, nesting birds or any other protected species.  Therefore, if applicable, it is advisable to consult your tree surgeon / consultant to agree an acceptable time for carrying out the approved works."
