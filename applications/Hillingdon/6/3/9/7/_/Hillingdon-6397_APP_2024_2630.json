    "The proposed first floor side extension, by virtue of its excessive size, width, bulk and massing, would appear as an insubordinate and incongruous form of development that would fail to respect the form and architectural composition of the host dwelling and would be harmful to the character and appearance of the surrounding area. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policies BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (2012), Policies DMHD 1, DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "Policy DMHB 18 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two (2020) requires a minimum of 100 square meters of private outdoor amenity space for a 4-bedroom house. However, with the presence of two existing rear outbuildings, only 37 square meters of private outdoor amenity space would remain. As a result, the proposal would fail to provide sufficient external amenity space for both current and future occupants, thereby conflicting with Policies DMHD 1 and DMHB 18 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two (2020).",
    "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination)."
