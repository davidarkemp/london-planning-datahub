  "decision_conditions": [
    "The applicant has failed to provide proof that the application property was not constructed before 1st July 1948 or after 28th October 2018. The application submission therefore fails to accord with Schedule 2, Part 1, Class AA.1. (c) of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "The proposed development does not constitute permitted development by virtue of the provisions of Schedule 2, Part 1, Class AA of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2020 (as amended) as the proposal, by reason of its siting, height, scale, bulk and design, would fail to harmonise with the character and architectural composition of the existing property and terrace in which it sits and would subsequently be detrimental to the visual amenity of the street scene and harmful to the character and appearance of the surrounding area, contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies (November 2012) and Policies DMHB 11 and DMHD 1 of the Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020). Prior approval is, therefore, refused under Condition AA.2.-(3)(a)(ii).",
    "Insufficient information has been submitted in order to enable the Local Planning Authority to establish whether the development complies with AA.1.(h) in respect of the floor to ceiling of any additional storey, measured internally, would not exceed the lower of- (i) 3 metres; or (ii) the floor to ceiling height, measured internally, of any storey of the principal part of the existing dwelling house.  The application submission therefore fails to accord with Schedule 2, Part 1, Class AA.1. (h) of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended)."
