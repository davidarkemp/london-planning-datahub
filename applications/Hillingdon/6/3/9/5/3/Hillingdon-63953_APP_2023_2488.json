This is because the cubic content of the resulting roof space would exceed the cubic content of the original roof space by more than 50 cubic metres; the proposed materials would not be of a similar appearance to those used in the construction of the exterior of the existing dwellinghouse; and the new gable-end side window is not shown to be obscure-glazed and non-opening unless the parts of the window which can be opened are more than 1.7m above the floor of the room in which the window is installed."
