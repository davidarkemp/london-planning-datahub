Bespoke marker posts will signpost the two entrances to the trail and will provide additional interest along it. The construction of the play trail will necessitate the selective removal of the scrub layer within the woodland. Scrub regeneration is expected to occur naturally within the woodland however, so this will not have a significant impact on the the condition of the retained woodland or on the opportunities presented to nesting birds.
