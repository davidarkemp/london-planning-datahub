  "application_type_full": "Listed building consent",
  "reference_no_of_permission_being_relied_on": "On the 24th of September 2014, the Thames Water Utilities Limited (Thames Tideway Tunnel) Development Consent Order (‘TTT DCO’) came into force, after consideration was made by the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government and the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs.\n\nOne of the development sites for the Tideway Project was the Greenwich Pumping Station (‘GREPS’) worksite. Alongside the various tunnel infrastructure elements permitted, the DCO also required various refurbishment works to be conducted to the Grade II listed EBEH (listing ref: 1213334). The works to be conducted to the EBEH were fairly prescriptive within the DCO, and were outlined within the DCO approved set of plans. \n\nSubsequently, an application was submitted to the Royal Borough of Greenwich (RBG) to attain consent for these refurbishment works, with RBG issuing the approval on 21 March 2022 (RBG planning reference: 22/0806/G). One of the works permitted by the application was the refurbishment of the EBEH’s timber front doors, with the scope of works being identical to that outlined within the DCO drawings.\n\nOn the 6th of June 2024, the doors were removed from their brackets to undertake the prescribed refurbishment works at an offsite location. Despite the control measures in place at site and the doors being placed into a labelled crate indicating the nature of the contents, the crate was accidentally removed from site by our waste handler. The loss of the doors was identified on the 12th of June when they were due to be transported off site. RBG & Historic England were notified of the loss the following day. \n",
