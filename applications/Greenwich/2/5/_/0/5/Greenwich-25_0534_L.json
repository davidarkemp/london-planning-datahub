  "description": "Replacement of a hedge that serves as a boundary between 141 Shooters Hill Road, and 143 Shooters Hill Road. Consent has been given by the owners of 141 Shooters Hill Road. Replacing an aged privet hedge which formed 143's boundary, with property 141, (with prior verbal acceptance from the neighbours at 141) with a low painted feather board fence, (152cm tall only - same height as front wall pillars) which starts from the bottom of the steps leading up to the house, (215cm from the building wall). Rationale: the hedge was dying and and grown to 250cm high x 225cm wide, was blocking out light, had become impossible to prune due to its excessive dimensions and covered part of the path to my resident's entrance.",
