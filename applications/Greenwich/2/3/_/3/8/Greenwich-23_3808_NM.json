  "description": "S96A application to amend the scheme the subject of planning permission dated 09/04/2021 Planning Ref: 20/2323/F for The construction of buildings to provide residential accommodation and a retail unit (Class A1) together with associated landscaping, amenity and playspace, refuse, cycle and car parking spaces, to allow;-  1. Faâ€¡ade articulation and levels: On all houses bar the pitched roof ones, horizontal banding channels have been added.  Fenestration to pitched roof houses on Zone 1 in Ridgebrook have been rationalised, omitting the cranked window. -  2: Levels Adjustment due to change of manufacturer. -  3. Materiality: In very localised areas, the landscape bricks have been changed to darker engineering bricks. The cladding on pitched roof houses on Zone 1 in Ridgebrook has been clarified as standing seam and more detail added to the roofs, such as the introduction of the required photovoltaic panels to achieve operational Net Zero Carbon. Colour accents to the side of front entrance doors to houses has been removed. -  4. Additional minor updates Omission of plant screens on the roof of flat blocks. Simplification of retail unit parapet detail to better integrate with the horizontal channels in the rest of the building. Access to said roof has also been limited to from within the retail unit only for security purposes.-  5. Updated wording of planning condition 016 Wording to be changed to 'prior to occupation' rather than 'within 3 months of practical completion' as the tenant might not be secured.",
