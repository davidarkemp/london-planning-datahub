  "description": "Application for a Minor Material Amendment under Section 73 of the Town & Country Planning Act 1990 to vary condition 1 (approved plans) and condition 5 (obscure glazing) of planning permission ref. 17/3451/F, dated 25/05/2018 for 'Change of use of upper floors from Residential (Class C3) to a 5-bed, 8 person HMO (Sui Generis), including external alterations including new rear dormer and changes to front roof lights'. The amendments are the following:The variation to condition 1 is sought to modify the height of the approved dormers by 0.5m and installation of an additional dormer (for a total of 3 dormers including flat roof link between each dormer).The variation to condition 5 is sought to amend the requirement that all the windows in the dormer windows shall be obscure glazed and non-opening below 1.7 metres from internal floor level. This would be modified so that all windows shall be fixed closed and include full obscure glazing up to a height of 1.7 metre from internal floor level.",
