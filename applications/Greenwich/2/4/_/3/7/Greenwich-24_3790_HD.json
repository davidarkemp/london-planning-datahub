  "description": "Replacing an aged privet hedge which formed 143's boundary, with property 141, (with prior verbal acceptance from the neighbours at 141) with a low painted feather board fence, (152cm tall only - same height as front wall pillars) which starts from the bottom of the steps leading up to the house, (215cm from the building wall). Rationale: the hedge was dying and and grown to 250cm high x 225cm wide, was blocking out light, had become impossible to prune due to its excessive dimensions and covered part of the path to my resident's entrance. Mr Cimen, of planning control has viewed the site and advised that this replacement boundary treatment is not in contravention of Grade II listing requirements, since it: (i) Is not out of character, (no consistent building materials have been used for all boundaries between lots across this row of terrace houses), i.e. there is no precedent for a particular material or style for these properties; (ii) Provides good shielding and looks attractive, whilst being lower and within regulation height restrictions, (significantly lower than the original hedge); (iii) Does not abut to the property; and (iv) There is no precedent for planning applications for these borders in the history of the council's planning records, so historically no one has ever sought permission to instate a boundary of any type, therefore there is no set treatment specification from which a precedent may be taken.",
