The purpose of the work is to maintain the health and structure of the tree, and to prevent overhanging branches from encroaching further onto my property roof.\r\rThe branches currently overhang the roof of my property and pose a risk of:\r\r1.Accumulation of leaves and debris in gutters, leading to drainage issues\r\r2.Restricted air flow and light to the roof surface, potentially promoting moss growth and damp\r\rThe proposed work will involve:\r\r1.Crown lifting to achieve a clearance of approximately 2?3 metres above the roofline\r\r2.Selective thinning of the canopy by no more than 20% to reduce density and allow light penetration, while preserving the tree?s natural shape\r\rAll work will be carried out in accordance with BS 3998:2010 ? Tree Work Recommendations, by a qualified and insured tree surgeon.\r\rAdditional Works for mixed trees (Conservation Area):\rIn addition, I would like to carry out trimming and maintenance of all mixed species trees and shrubs located at the front and side garden. Although these trees are not individually protected by a TPO, the property lies within a conservation area, and I understand that consent is required before undertaking any work on them.\r\rThese trees and shrubs have become overgrown, causing obstruction to the public pedestrian pathway and significantly blocking natural sunlight to the front of my property. I propose to reduce them to a manageable size while maintaining their health and appearance.--- Status: INV--- Decision: --- Date Decision Issued: ---"
