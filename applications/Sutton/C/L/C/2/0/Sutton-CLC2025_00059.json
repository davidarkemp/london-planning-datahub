For land that is included within the WSI, no demolition/development/excavation shall take place other than in accordance with the approved WSI programme of site evaluation. Written schemes of investigation will need to be prepared and implemented by a suitably qualified, professionally accredited archaeological practice.\r\rReason: To safeguard the archaeological heritage of the Borough in accordance with Policy 30 of the Sutton Local Plan 2018.  This condition is required to be pre-commencement as any ground works without the required investigation could result in harm to the archaeological heritage of the Borough."
