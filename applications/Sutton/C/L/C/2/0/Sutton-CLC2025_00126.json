    "Prior to the commencement of development, measures for the protection of all tree(s) shown to be retained shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority. The measures shall be in accordance with the British Standard BS5837:  Trees in relation to design, demolition and construction. Any works/development on site shall be carried out in strict accordance with the approved details and the protective measures shall only be removed on completion of the development.  \r\rReason: Required prior to commencement of development to satisfy the Local Planning Authority that the tree (s) to be retained will not be damaged during demolition or construction and to ensure tree(s) significant in terms of their provision of local amenity are protected from construction damage, in accordance with best practice and Policy 28 of the Sutton Local Plan 2018.\r",
    "No development shall begin, including demolition and site clearance works, until a Construction Logistics Plan (CLP) and Construction Management Plan (CMP), to include details of: (a) loading and unloading of plant and materials; (b ) storage of plant and materials; (c) programme of works (including measures for traffic management); (d) provision of boundary hoarding, behind any visibility zones of construction traffic routing; (e) hours of operation; (f) and means to prevent deposition of mud on the highway have been submitted, to and approved in writing by, the Local Planning Authority. The development shall be constructed in accordance with the approved statement. \r\rReason: To ensure that the proposed development does not interfere with the free flow of traffic and conditions of safety on the public highway, and to ensure the development process does not have a significant adverse impact on the amenities of nearby residential properties in accordance with Policy 36 of the Sutton's local Plan 2018.\r",
    "Prior to the commencement of development, a finalised scheme for the management of surface water run-off must be submitted to the Local Planning Authority and approved in writing which provides further details of proposed SuDS measures as part of the detailed drainage design in order to manage surface water run-off as close to its source as possible in accordance with the Mayor's drainage hierarchy. The submitted scheme must:\r\r(i) include the results of on-site infiltration testing to BRE Digest 365 in order to assess the feasibility of infiltration SuDS measures at this location;\r(ii) give consideration to green infrastructure (SI) measures as part of the proposed SuDS strategy in line with step 3 of the Mayor's drainage hierarchy, such as a green roof or raingardens;\r(ii) where necessary include revised hydrological calculations carried out by an appropriately qualified professional to show that peak run-off rates and volumes for the 1 in 100 year 6-hour rainfall event (plus 40% for climate change) will be as close as reasonably practicable to the greenfield run-off rates and volumes for the same event;\r(iv) demonstrate that the 1 in 30 year rainfall event (plus 40% for climate change) can be contained without flooding; any flooding occurring between the 1 in 30 and 1 in 100 year event (plus 40% for climate change) will be safely contained on site; and that rainfall in excess of the 1 in 100 year event is managed to minimise risks.\r\rReason: To comply with London Plan Policy SI13 and Policy 32 of the Sutton Local Plan 2018.",
    "Prior to the commencement of development above ground (excluding demolition) the type and treatment of the materials, including samples, to be used on the exterior of the building(s) shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority. The approved materials shall be used in the construction of the development hereby approved, completed prior to its occupation/use and retained thereafter.\r\rReason: To safeguard the visual amenities of the area and to ensure compliance with Policy 28 of the Sutton Local Plan 2018. This condition is required to be pre-commencement to ensure that materials are considered at a early stage of the construction process and it is important that details are agreed at this stage as this could potentially impact on construction methods."
