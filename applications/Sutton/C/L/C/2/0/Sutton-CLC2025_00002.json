This will take the form of a Biodiversity Enhancement and Management Plan (BEMP) and include an updated Biodiversity Net Gain assessment of the development, working to LBS's methodology (and bespoke calculator) and in general accordance with BS42020:2013, to\rprovide the highest possible biodiversity values on site.\rThe BEMP will provide:\r     a) The sizes of each habitat area to be created, how they will be created and full details and responsibilities on at least       30 years of aftercare and ongoing management and monitoring from creation;\r     b) An update to the submitted BNG Assessment based on the final landscaping details;\r    c) Green infrastructure, including but not limited to:\r          a) Extensive substrate based biodiverse roofs, including how access for management will be created and           maintained (community hall and cycle storage)\r          b) Perimeter living wall and any internal fences / screens to be greened\rThese will be provided to maximise local biodiversity and contribute to increased urban permeability. Full details on substrate (including physico-chemical information), species, planting density and abundance will be provided, including cross-sectional views. Biodiverse / biosolar roofs must utilise solely native species.\rGreen infrastructure should select species appropriate for the type of roof / planting\rproposed, in accordance with Clause d).\r    d) A soft landscaping masterplan will detail biodiversity enhancement through planting schemes that provide nectar,         pollen and fruit resources throughout the seasons, a variety of structural diversity and larval food plants, through no          less than 60% native and local species by number and diversity. Substrate, provenance and numbers of all bulbs, seeds      and plugs / whips / trees will be detailed, as will aftercare and ongoing management. Ornamental plants will not          include any genera or species on Schedule 9 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act (1981) or the LISI list and should be      on the \"RHS Plants for Pollinators\" lists (or of documented wildlife value), to provide increased resource availability;\r     e) Current substrate physico-chemical values / soil sampling analysis for the proposed poor semi-improved neutral      grassland, to determine suitability of the proposed habitat creation and seed mixture;\r     f) A timetable of delivery for each habitat to be created;\r     g) Details on the monitoring of habitats and the provision of a report, which shall be provided to the LPA on the 1st      November of each year of monitoring (years 1-3 after creation, years 5, 7 & 10 and every 5 years thereafter), which will      assess the condition of all habitats created and any and all necessary management or replacement / remediation      measures required to deliver the Net Gain values set out in the BEMP for each habitat;\r     h) Details of the contingency methods for management and funding, should the monitoring identify changes are      required to ensure the habitat(s) are in the appropriate condition to deliver the Net Gain values set out in the BEMP      for each habitat.\rWork shall be undertaken in accordance with the approved scheme and thereafter retained\rin perpetuity.\r\rReason: To enhance the biodiversity value of the land in accordance with Policy 26 of the Sutton Local Plan 2018.\rReason for pre-commencement: This condition is required to be pre-commencement to ensure that the biodiversity value of the land is fully assessed and is not harmed and / or fully mitigated for, prior to the demolition / construction process."
