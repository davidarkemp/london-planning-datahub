    "Prior to the commencement of development (excluding demolition) the type and treatment of the materials, including samples, to be used on the exterior of the building(s) shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority. The approved materials shall be used in the construction of the development hereby approved, completed prior to its occupation/use and retained thereafter.\r\rReason: To safeguard the visual amenities of the area and to ensure compliance with Policies 28 and 30 of the Sutton Local Plan 2018. This condition is required to be pre-commencement to ensure that materials are considered at a early stage of the construction process and it is important that details are agreed at this stage as this could potentially impact on construction methods.",
    "Prior to the occupation of the development, full details of hard and soft landscaping shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority. All hard and soft landscaping and tree planting shall be carried out in accordance with the approved details and to a reasonable standard in accordance with the relevant recommendations of appropriate British Standards (in particular, BS 3882:  Specifications for Topsoil, Recommendations (2015) and BS 8545:  Trees from Nursery to Independence in the Landscape, Recommendations (2014) or other recognised codes of good practice). The works shall be carried out prior to the occupation of any part or relevant phase of the development or in accordance with the timetable agreed with the Local Planning Authority. Any tree(s) or plants that (within a period of five years after planting) are removed, die, or (in the opinion of the Local Planning Authority) are damaged or defective shall be replaced as soon as is reasonably practicable with others of a similar size/species/number as originally approved, unless the Local Planning Authority gives its consent to any variation. \r\rReason: To ensure the provision, establishment and maintenance of a reasonable standard of landscape in accordance with the approved designs in accordance with Policy 28 of the Sutton Local Plan 2018.",
    "The site and building works required to implement the development shall only be carried out between the hours of 08.00 and 18.00 Mondays to Fridays, and between 08.00 and 13.00 on Saturdays, and not at all on Bank Holidays and Sundays. \r\rReason: To protect the amenities of adjoining and nearby properties during the construction of the development hereby permitted in accordance with Policy 34 Of the Sutton Local Plan 2018.",
    "Prior to the commencement of development, an energy statement incorporating 'as-designed' Standard Assessment Procedure (SAP) outputs must be submitted to the Local Planning Authority and approved in writing which demonstrates how each of the proposed dwellings will:\r(i) minimise CO2 emissions through application of the Mayor's energy hierarchy (be lean; be clean; be green);\r(ii) achieve at least a 35% reduction in regulated CO2 emissions compared to a 'notional' Part L 2021 compliant dwelling;\r(iii) demonstrate at least a 10% reduction in total CO2 emissions (regulated and unregulated) through on-site renewable energy generation.\r\rReason: To comply with Policy 31 of the Sutton Local Plan 2018.",
    "Prior to the commencement of development, a scheme for the management of surface water run-off must be submitted to the Local Planning Authority and approved in writing which identifies appropriate site drainage and flood risk management measures, including SuDS, in order to manage surface water run-off as close to its source as possible in accordance with the Mayor's drainage hierarchy. The submitted scheme must:\r(i) provide details of the design storm period and intensity, proposed SuDS measures to delay and control the rate of surface water discharged from the site and proposed measures to prevent pollution of the receiving groundwater and/or surface waters;\r(ii) include calculations carried out by an appropriately qualified professional to show that the peak run-off rate for the 1 in 100 year 6-hour rainfall event (plus 30% for climate change) will be as close as reasonably practicable to the greenfield run-off rate for the same event\r(iii) demonstrate that the 1 in 30 year rainfall event (plus 30% for climate change) can be contained without flooding; any flooding occurring between the 1 in 30 and 1 in 100 year event (plus 30% for climate change) will be safely contained on site; and that rainfall in excess of the 1 in 100 year event is managed to minimise risks The development must be carried out in accordance with the approved details and thereafter retained.\r\rReason: To comply with Policy 32 of the Sutton Local Plan 2018.",
    "Prior to commencement of the development, a completed Water Efficiency Calculator must be submitted to the Local Planning Authority and approved in writing to show that internal potable water consumption for the newly created dwelling will be limited to no more than 110 litres per person per day (l/p/d) based on the Government's national calculation method for the purposes of Part G of the Building Regulations. \r\rReason: To comply with Policy 33 of the Sutton Local Plan 2018",
    "Prior to occupancy of the development hereby permitted, a scheme for wildlife and nesting features shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority. These will include but not limited to:\ro 2 x general purposes bird boxes (at least 3m high and facing into amenity shrub/vegetation)\r\rFull details should be provided of the feature's location, height and distance from any external lighting (which if located too close, could prevent them from being successfully used), in plan and elevation views.\r\rReason: To enhance the biodiversity value of the land in accordance with Policy 26 of the Sutton Local Plan 2018.\r\rGuidance on what type of habitat /features would be suitable is provided in Sutton's Biodiversity Strategy (page 70)"
