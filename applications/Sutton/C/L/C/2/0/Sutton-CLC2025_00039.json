Any piling must be undertaken in accordance with the terms of the approved piling method statement.\" \r\rReason: The proposed works will be in close proximity to underground sewerage utility infrastructure. Piling has the potential to significantly impact / cause failure of local underground sewerage utility infrastructure.

This should consider the impacts of road traffic emission at selected receptor locations taking into account both existing residents and future users of the development;\r-       The applicant should provide details of emissions from the energy plant and any air quality impacts this will have at locations of future users of the development and at nearby residential locations;\r-       When modelling future concentrations, the impacts from other committed developments will need to be included.\r-       An air quality neutral assessment to determine that the proposed development is \"Air Quality Neutral\" in accordance with London Plan Policy SI1.\r-       The assessment will need to consider whether the development complies with Buildings and Transport Emissions benchmarks established in the Mayors 'Sustainable Construction and Design SPG. The report should be prepared in accordance with the GLAs 'Air Quality Neutral Planning Support Guidance'. The assessment should assess whether mitigation is required by determining whether calculated building or transport-related emissions associated with the development exceed the benchmarks.\r-       Attention to the GLA's SPG on controlling dust and emissions during construction is recommended. Please note the requirement of the low emission zone for NRMM.     \r\rThe development shall be undertaken in accordance with the approved details.\r\rReason: To comply with London Plan Policy SI1 and Policy 34 of the Sutton Local Plan 2018.\r",
