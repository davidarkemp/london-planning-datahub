    "Prior to the occupation of the development, full details of hard and soft landscaping shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority. All hard and soft landscaping and tree planting shall be carried out in accordance with the approved details and to a reasonable standard in accordance with the relevant recommendations of appropriate British Standards (in particular, BS 3882:  Specifications for Topsoil, Recommendations (2015) and BS 8545:  Trees from Nursery to Independence in the Landscape, Recommendations (2014) or other recognised codes of good practice). The works shall be carried out prior to the occupation of any part or relevant phase of the development or in accordance with the timetable agreed with the Local Planning Authority. Any tree(s) or plants that (within a period of five years after planting) are removed, die, or (in the opinion of the Local Planning Authority) are damaged or defective shall be replaced as soon as is reasonably practicable with others of a similar size/species/number as originally approved, unless the Local Planning Authority gives its consent to any variation. \r\rReason: To ensure the provision, establishment and maintenance of a reasonable standard of landscape in accordance with the approved designs in accordance with Policy 28 of the Sutton Local Plan 2018."
