The finalised BIA must include:\r(i) evidence, based on on-site geotechnical and environmental survey work and detailed design work, to demonstrate that the proposed basement area will not affect existing surface-water flow routes or increase risk of flooding for either the donor dwelling or adjacent buildings and structures;\r(ii) details of structural waterproofing arrangements and proposed design specifications in order to ensure effective water retention below ground-level;\r(iii) details of the proposed foundation solution / construction method;\r(iv) arrangements for dewatering the excavation during construction in order to deal with potential groundwater seepage and superficial runoff during rainfall events;\r(v) confirmation that the basement will be waterproofed to Grade 3 (BS 8102) to protect against ingress of soil moisture and perched groundwater\r(vi) details of all proposed SuDS measures including the proposed external permeable paving area in order to to manage surface water run-off from the site in line with the Mayor's drainage hierarchy.\r\rReason: To comply with Policy 32 of the Sutton Local Plan 2018."
