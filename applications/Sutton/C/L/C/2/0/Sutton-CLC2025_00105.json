The development shall be constructed in accordance with the approved statement.\r\rReason: To ensure that the proposed development does not interfere with the free flow of traffic and conditions of safety on the public highway, and to ensure the development process does not have a significant adverse impact on the amenities of nearby residential properties in accordance with Policies 29 and 36 of the Sutton Local Plan 2018. This condition is required to be pre-commencement as the Construction Logistics Plan needs to be in place before any works take place and to mitigate against the impacts of the demolition / construction process."
