    "Prior to the commencement of development (excluding demolition and enabling works), documentary evidence must be submitted to the Local Planning Authority and approved in writing to show that the development will achieve an increase in overall green space coverage of at least 10% and an improved Green Space Factor (GSF) score of at least +0.2 compared to the baseline GSF score prior to redevelopment. The council's GSF scoring system set out in the council's 'Technical Guidance Note - Building a Sustainable Sutton' (June 2018) must be used for this purpose. The development shall be carried out in accordance with the approved details and thereafter retained.\r\rReason: To comply with Policy 33 of the Sutton Local Plan 2018",
    "No works on implementing the planning permission may be carried out until details have been submitted to and approved by the Council for a scheme of works to widen the main construction vehicle access from Angel Hill. The approved works must then be carried out before any demolition and site clearance works begin on the remainder of the site within the red line of the location plan approved under Condition 1 of this permission.\r \rReason: To minimise impacts on the highway network during the construction and operational phases of the development, in accordance with Policy 36 of the Sutton Local Plan 2018. The condition is required to be pre-commencement because the demolition and construction impacts of the development cannot be mitigated using a later trigger point.",
    "Prior to commencement of groundworks (excluding site investigations and demolition), a final detailed drainage design, including drawings, supporting calculations, Drainage Assessment Form and SuDS Statement, stating what mitigation measures are being proposed in the event of a pump failure shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority. A revised detailed management plan confirming routine maintenance tasks, frequency and who shall be responsible for the maintenance of all drainage components must also be submitted to demonstrate how the drainage system is to be maintained for the lifetime of the development. The system shall be implemented and thereafter managed and maintained in accordance with the approved details.\r\rReason: To prevent the risk of flooding to and from the site in accordance with relevant policy requirements including but not limited to London Plan Policy SI 13, its associated Sustainable Design and Construction SPG, the Non-Statutory Technical Standards for Sustainable Drainage Systems."
