    "The ^IN; window(s) in the ^IN; elevation(s) of the development hereby approved shall be glazed with obscure glass and fixed shut to a height of 1.7 metres above the finished floor level of the room in which the window is installed in a manner that they cannot be opened and retained thereafter.\r\rReason: To safeguard the current level of privacy enjoyed by the occupants of adjoining properties in accordance with and to ensure compliance with the Sutton Local Plan 2018.",
    "Site construction works shall only be carried out between the hours of 0800 and 1800 hours Monday to Friday, 0800 and 1300 hours on Saturday and not at all on Sundays and Bank Holidays.\r\rReason: To protect neighbouring amenities.",
    "Prior to the commencement of development, an Energy Statement incorporating 'as-designed' Standard Assessment Procedure (SAP) outputs must be submitted to the Local Planning Authority and approved in writing which demonstrates how the proposed dwelling/s will apply the Mayor's energy hierarchy (use less energy, supply energy efficiently and use renewable energy) to achieve at least a 35% reduction in CO2 emissions below the target emission rate (TER) based on Part L1A of the 2013 Building Regulations and at least a 10% reduction in total emissions (regulated and unregulated) through on-site renewable energy generation. The development should exceed the minimum Part L1A emissions standards through energy efficiency measures alone. The development shall be carried out in accordance with the approved details and thereafter retained.\r\rReason:  To comply with Policy 31 of the Sutton Local Plan 2018. This condition is required to be pre-commencement to ensure that these details are considered at a early stage of the process and the required details are an integral part of the construction.",
    "Prior to the commencement of development, a site specific Flood Risk Assessment (FRA) together with a scheme for the management of surface water runoff must be submitted to the Local Planning Authority and approved in writing which identifies appropriate site drainage and flood risk management measures, including SuDS, in order to manage surface water run-off as close to its source as possible in accordance with the Mayor's drainage hierarchy. The submitted scheme should:\r(i) provide details of the design storm period and intensity, proposed SuDS measures to delay and control the rate of surface water discharged from the site and proposed measures to prevent pollution of the receiving groundwater and/or surface waters;\r(ii) include calculations carried out by an appropriately qualified professional to show that the peak runoff rate for the 1 in 100 year 6-hour rainfall event (plus 30% for climate change) will be as close as reasonably practicable to the greenfield runoff rate for the same event; \r(iii) where greenfield runoff rates cannot be achieved, and methods of drainage include those lower down the Mayor's drainage hierarchy, evidence should be provided to justify the proposed measures and to demonstrate that the peak runoff rate for the 1 in 100 year 6-hour rainfall event (plus 30% for climate change) will be no more than 3 times the calculated greenfield run-off rate for the same event; and\r(iv) demonstrate that the 1 in 30 year rainfall event (plus 30% for climate change) can be contained without flooding; any flooding occurring between the 1 in 30 and 1 in 100 year event (plus 30% for climate change) will be safely contained on site; and that rainfall in excess of the 1 in 100 year event is managed to minimise risks.\rThe development shall be carried out in accordance with the approved details and thereafter retained.\r\rReason: To comply with Policy 32 of the Sutton Local Plan 2018. This condition is required to be pre-commencement to ensure that these details are considered at a early stage of the process and the required details are an integral part of the construction.",
    "Prior to first occupation of the development, written confirmation that the approved site drainage and flood risk management measures, including SuDS, have been implemented as part of the development as built must be submitted to the Local Planning Authority and approved in writing. Where different from the approved details, further calculations carried out by an appropriately qualified professional must be provided to show that the peak runoff rate for the 1 in 100 year 6-hour rainfall event (plus 30% for climate change) will be as close as reasonably practicable to the calculated greenfield runoff rate for the same event and no more than 3 times the calculated greenfield runoff rate for the same event. All the measures implemented shall be retained for as long as the development is in existence.\r\rReason: To comply with Policy 32 of the Sutton Local Plan 2018.",
    "Prior to first occupation of the development, as-built' Standard Assessment Procedure (SAP) outputs must be submitted to the Local Planning Authority and approved in writing to demonstrate that the development has been carried out in accordance with the approved details. If the development is unable to meet the required reduction in CO2 emissions through the approved energy strategy, then any shortfall shall be made up through the application of further sustainability measures unless otherwise approved by the Local Planning Authority in writing. The development shall be carried out in accordance with the approved details and thereafter retained.\r\rReason: To comply with Policy 31 of the Sutton Local Plan 2018.",
    "Prior to first occupation of the development, a completed Water Efficiency Calculator for New Dwellings must be submitted to the Local Planning Authority and approved in writing to show that internal potable water consumption for each of the dwellings will be limited to 110 litres per person per day (l/p/d) based on the Government's national calculation method for water efficiency for the purposes of Part G of the Building Regulations. The Water Efficiency Calculator should be accompanied by details of the location and type of all appliances or fittings that use water, the capacity or flow rate of any equipment and any rainwater or greywater collection systems incorporated as part of the development. The development shall be carried out in accordance with the approved details and thereafter retained.\r\rReason: To comply with Policy 33 of the Sutton Local Plan 2018."
