The proposal is therefore contrary to policies G3 and G4 of the London Plan 2021 and policies 23, 24, 25 and 28 of the Sutton Local Plan 2018.",

The proposal would therefore result in harm to the character of the area and no degree of camouflaging of the mast would reduce this impact and the proposal would be contrary to policies 23 and 28 of the Sutton Local Plan 2018."
