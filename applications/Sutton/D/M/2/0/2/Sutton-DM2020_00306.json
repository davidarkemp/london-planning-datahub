    "The proposed development, by reason of its height and general layout, would prejudice the future redevelopment of the adjacent land at land between 53 and 61 Malden Road and the wider site allocation S33 and would represent an underdevelopment of the site allocation S33 by not making the most efficient use of the land and wider site allocation.  As such the proposal is unacceptable in principle and would be contrary to paragraph 123 of the NPPF, Policy 3.4 of the London Plan and Policies 1 and 40 of the Sutton Local Plan.",
    "Whilst it has been demonstrated that the proposed development in its own right is not sufficiently viable to provide affordable housing, by not delivering affordable units, it would place significant pressure on prospective developers to deliver affordable housing through the redevelopment of the remaining portion of the site allocation, which would prejudice the further development of the site. In this sense, the proposed piecemeal development of the allocated site is deemed to be contrary to Paragraph 123 of the NPPF, Policies 3.4, 3.8, 3.9 and 3.11 of the London Plan (2016), as well as Policies 1, 8 and 40 (Site Allocation 33) of the Sutton Local Plan.",
    "The proposed development by virtue of the form and blank, largely featureless and utilitarian design of the north facing flank elevation of building A, would be viewed at a point as an incomplete and incongruous form of development, and as such, would have a detrimental effect on the character and appearance of the local street-scene of Malden Road, contrary to Policies 3.5, 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan (2016), and Policy 28 of the Sutton Local Plan.",
    "The proposal would have a detrimental impact on the residential amenity of the occupiers of 9 Tudor Close by virtue of introducing a 3 storey building directly to the rear of its private garden, which would have an overbearing impact on this space. The proposed development would therefore be contrary to Policy 29 of the Sutton Local Plan.",
    "Insufficient information has been submitted to demonstrate that the proposed development scheme has fully considered compliance with the Mayor's revised heating hierarchy, and has failed to explain why favoured sources of sustainable energy such as air source heat pumps have been ruled out. In addition no SAP10 assessment has been carried out in parallel with the SAP 2012 assessment as required by the Mayor's Energy Assessments Guidance (GLA, October 2020), meaning it is not possible to accurately assess whether the proposed development would provide acceptable emission reductions. The proposal therefore fails to complies with the Mayor's Energy Assessments Guidance (GLA, October 2020), and Policy 31 of the Sutton Local Plan.\r\r",

The roof plan and elevation drawings show these to be flush with each other but the loft plan drawing shows one positioned closer to the ridge line. Also, the elevation shows them to spaced differently when compared to the roof plan. Please amend all relevant drawings in order to ensure accurate correlation going forward.",
