    "By reason of its nature and siting, it is considered that the use of the site for residential purposes would be unacceptable in land use terms noting that these parcels of garden land make an important contribution to the character and appearance of the surrounding area. As such, it is considered that the proposed development would be unacceptable in principle, as the development of this corner plot and intensification of the residential use would cause significant harm to the prevailing character of the streetscene and the wider St Helier Estate contrary to policies H1, H2 and D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policies 1 and 28 of Sutton's Local Plan 2018.",
    "The proposed dwelling would, due to its single storey nature and excessive width, appear as a disproportionate and incongruous addition, which would be significantly out of keeping with the general pattern of existing development. As such, the proposed development would result in a wholly unacceptable and discordant development that would harm the streetscene and the wider St Helier Estate and the proposal would therefore by contrary to policy D3 and D4 of the London Plan 2021, policy 28 of Sutton's Local Plan 2018 and the council's Urban Design Guide SPD14.",
    "Table 3.1 of the London Plan 2021 sets out the minimum floor area for a 1-bedroomed 2 person dwelling is 50sqm. The proposed dwelling would provide 44sqm and therefore fails to meet the expected Gross Internal Area (GIA). In addition, the new dwelling would have a small parcel of land approx 8sqm to the rear of the new dwelling, this would fall short of the 25sqm expected provision as stated in the council's Urban Design Guide SPD14. Dwellings within the area typically meet the expected standards and as such it is considered that the proposal would not provide a suitable level of private outdoor amenity space and would result in harm to the amenities of future occupants. The proposal is therefore contrary to policy D6 of the London Plan 2021, policy 9 of the Sutton Local Plan 2018 and the council's Urban Design Guide SPD14.",
    "Without evidence to the contrary, the application has failed to provide evidence that the proposal will provide a satisfactory reduction in carbon emissions. As such, the application would be contrary to Policies SI 1 and SI 2 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy 31 of the Sutton Local Plan 2018."
