    "The proposal by reason of its excessive depth and height and uncharacteristic roofing materials  would constitute a disproportionate and overly prominent addition to the existing dwelling which would fail to respect the existing prevailing form of development in the area to the detriment of the character and appearance of the site and the surrounding area. The proposal would therefore be contrary to the principles of the National Planning Policy Framework, policy 28 of the Sutton Local Plan and SPD4 'Design of Residential Extensions'.",
    "The proposed single storey pergola, by reason of its excessive depth combined with its height along the boundary with no. 2 Boundary Road, would have an adverse impact on the amenities of this adjoining property by way of a loss of outlook and un-neighbourly sense of enclosure and appearing overbearing. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policy 29 of Sutton Local Plan 2018."
