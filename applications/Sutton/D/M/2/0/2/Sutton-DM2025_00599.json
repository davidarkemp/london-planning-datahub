Prior approval is granted as the development would meet relevant criteria in accordance with Class MA.",
    "Prior to the occupation of the development, full details of the secure cycle storage facilities shall be submitted to, and approved in writing by, the Local Planning Authority which shall show their positioning within the site, the size and materials of the enclosure and the means of access. The approved details shall be implemented on site prior to the first occupation of the development hereby approved and thereafter permanently retained in accordance with the approved details.\r\rReason: To ensure the development provides an adequate level of cycle parking facilities and to encourage sustainable modes of transport, in accordance with Policies 36 and 37 of the Sutton Local Plan 2018.",
    "Prior to occupation of the development hereby approved, full details of refuse and recycling storage shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority. The approved details shall be implemented in full prior to occupation of the development and retained thereafter.\r\rReason: To avoid harm to the character and appearance of the streetscene and local area in accordance with policy 28 of the Sutton Local Plan 2018 and to ensure adequate provision of refuse and recycling facilities in the interests of amenity for future and neighbouring occupiers in accordance with policy 29 of the Sutton Local Plan 2018.",
    "Before the development hereby permitted is commenced, a scheme for protecting the proposed dwellings from noise shall be submitted and approved by the Local Planning Authority to ensure that the noise level of 35 dBLAeq,16 hour in living rooms and bedrooms during the daytime (0700 to 2300 hours) and 30 dBLAeq,8 hour  and 45 dBLAFmax during the night time (2300 to 0700 hours) in bedrooms in accordance with BS8233:2014. Where these levels cannot be met with windows open appropriate acoustic ventilation should be provided so that the room can be sufficiently ventilated.  The acoustic performance of any passive vent, variable speed mechanical air supply unit or whole house ventilation must be sufficient to ensure that the noise level standards given above are not compromised.\r\rReason: To safeguard the amenity of the future occupants and neighbours by minimising impacts of the development that would otherwise give rise to nuisance in accordance with policies 9 and 29 of the Sutton Local Plan 2018."
