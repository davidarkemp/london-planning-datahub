No railings, fences, walls or other means of enclosure shall be erected on this flat roof, and no alterations shall be carried out to the elevation of the application property to form access onto the roof.\r\rReason: Such a use could be harmful to the existing amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring residential properties as a result of overlooking and loss of privacy and the generation of noise and disturbance contrary to Policy 29 of the Sutton Local Plan 2018.",
