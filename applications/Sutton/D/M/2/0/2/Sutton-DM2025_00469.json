There will be no materials stored within Construction Exclusion Zone (CEZ), and the Tree Protection Fencing (TPF) and other measures shall only be removed on completion of development. On completion of development, the applicant (their heirs or successors in title) shall submit photographic evidence of compliance with BS5837:2012. \r\rReason: To ensure tree(s) significant in terms of their provision of local amenity are protected from construction damage, in accordance with best practice and Policy 28 of the Sutton Local Plan 2018.\r",
    "All external facing materials, treatments and finishes shall be similar to those of the original building and maintained and retained thereafter. This applies unless differences are shown on the drawings we have approved. \r\rReason: To ensure that the extension harmonises with the existing building and to ensure compliance with Policies 28 and 30 of the Sutton Local Plan 2018.",
    "The development must be carried out in accordance with the provisions of the Fire Safety Statement 26th March 2025 by Michael Smith \runless otherwise approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority.\r\rReason: To ensure that the development incorporates the necessary fire safety measures in accordance with the Mayor's London Plan Policy D12.\r",

    "The proposed new first floor level window to the bedroom on the east side elevation and the two bathroom windows at first floor level in the west elevation hereby approved shall be obscure glazed and non-opening up to a height of 1.7m above floor level prior to its occupation and shall be retained in that form as long as the development is in existence. \r\rReason: To protect the amenities of adjoining occupiers and to ensure compliance with Policy 29 of the Sutton Local Plan 2018.",
    "The flat roof sections of the development at first floor level hereby approved shall not be used, all or in part, as a terrace or other amenity space. No railings, fences, walls or other means of enclosure shall be erected on this flat roof, and no alterations shall be carried out to the rear elevation of the application property to form access onto the roof.  \r\rReason: Such a use could be harmful to the existing amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring residential properties as a result of overlooking and loss of privacy and the generation of noise and disturbance in accordance with Policy 29 of the Sutton Local Plan."
