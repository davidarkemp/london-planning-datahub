    "The proposed developments siting and appearance by reason of the height, bulk and massing of the proposed mast and ground based equipment would result in a dominant, imposing and overbearing form of development which would result in an obtrusive feature within the surroundings. The proposal would result in harm to the character of the area, and the setting of the residential properties surrounding the site.  No degree of camouflaging of the mast and equipment would sufficiently reduce this impact. As such the proposal would be contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework and policies 23 and 28 of the Sutton Local Plan 2018."
