    "The proposed development would result in a significant and disproportionate increase in scale, height, massing and bulk of the built form, which combined with the increase in footprint and ancillary development including car parking areas, would result in harm to the openness and visual amenity of the Green Belt and would constitute inappropriate development in the Green Belt. The development is also considered to represent an overdevelopment of the site given its scale, bulk, massing and footprint which would be out of character with the adjacent area. The proposal is considered to constitute separate residential dwellings within the C3 use class under the Use Classes Order 1987 (as amended), and in the absence of compelling 'Very Special Circumstances' which would outweigh the harm to the Green Belt, the proposal is not acceptable in principle and would be contrary to Policies G2, D3, D4, H13 of the London Plan 2021, Policies 11, 24 and 28 of the Sutton Local Plan 2018 and paragraphs 148 and 149 of the National Planning Policy Framework.",
    "The proposed development by reason of the substantial demolition of a listed building, together with the impact on the remaining listed building (Woodcote Grove House) by the proximity of an excessive amount of proposed development, will have an adverse impact on the significance of the listed building as the focal point of the site and would erode the rural setting of the listed building resulting in a high degree of 'less than substantial harm' to the significance of the designated heritage asset as per paragraph 202 of the National Planning Policy Framework. Any potential public benefits of the proposal would not outweigh the harm to the listed building and its setting, nor has it been demonstrated that all reasonable efforts have been made to sustain the existing use, find new uses or mitigate the extent of the harm. Furthermore, it has not been demonstrated that the works are the minimum required to secure the long-term beneficial use and retain the significance and conservation of the asset. As a result, it is considered that the proposal would be contrary to Policies D3, D4, HC1 of the London Plan 2021, Policies 28 and 30 of the Sutton Local Plan 2018 and paragraphs 202 and 204 of the National Planning Policy Framework.",
    "It has not been demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority that the 'Enabling Development' viability approach is justified for this application and that the scheme would be unviable to provide affordable housing, contrary to Policy 8 of the Sutton Local Plan 2018, and Policies H4, H5 and H13 of London Plan 2021.",
    "An agreement is not in place to secure the appropriate carbon neutral development, a Travel Plan, an Employment and Skills clause for local residents, and an air quality neutral proposal to support the development. The proposed development is therefore contrary to Policies SI2, T4 and E11 of the London Plan 2021, Policies 31 and 36 of the Sutton Local Plan 2018 and Sutton's Supplementary Planning Document 5 Planning Obligations."
