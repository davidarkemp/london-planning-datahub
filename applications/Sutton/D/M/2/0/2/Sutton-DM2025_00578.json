    "The proposed development by reason of its of its  limited plot size, location, design and form, fails to respond positively to the character and appearance of the host dwelling, the terraced row it forms part of and the wider surrounding area. The extensions to form the new dwelling are incongruous and unsympathetic to the host dwelling and street scene, resulting in an wholly inappropriate form of residential development inconsistent with the prevailing pattern of development within the immediate area, that would adversely affect the openness of this prominent corner site in which it is located and which would fail to complement the established built pattern in the area and would therefore adversely affect the streetscene appearing out of character contrary to Policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan 2021, Policy 28 of the Sutton Local Plan 2018 and SPD14 'Creating Locally Distinctive Places'.\r",
    "The proposed development fails to provide adequate external amenity space for the future occupiers of the new dwelling. As such, the development would be contrary to Policy D6 of the London Plan 2021, Policy 9 of the Sutton Local Plan 2018 and SPD14 'Creating Locally Distinctive Places'.",
    "It is considered that in the absence of information to the contrary the proposal would result in inadequate and insufficient car parking and manoeuvring space which would lead to unsafe parking conditions resulting in unacceptable harm to the transport and highway network in the area contrary to policy 37 and appendix 11 of the Sutton Local Plan 2018.\r",
    "In the absence of evidence to indicate otherwise, the proposal has failed to demonstrate that the proposed development would conserve or enhance biodiversity within this site.
