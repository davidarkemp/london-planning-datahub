  "description": "It is proposed that a pre-fabricated metal apex shed 2.45m x 2.67m in size with a height to apex of 2.02m will be erected. This will be used to store forestry and woodland management tools and equipment associated with managing the surrounding woodland. A lean-to, open-sided but covered log store will be erected on one side of this shed with approximate dimensions 2.0m x 2.45m and this will be used to store and season logs harvested from the woodland. The shed (as per drawings MW304 and MW306) will be installed in the open area in the centre of the woodland.",
