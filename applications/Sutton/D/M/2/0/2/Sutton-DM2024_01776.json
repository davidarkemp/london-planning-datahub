  "description": "Change of use from class Eg (Offices to carry out any operational or administrative functions) to class Ec (Provision of professional services).\r\rMusical instruments, computers, small speaker systems and TV screens will be the only machinery involved in the system. We would like the hours of use to run Monday to Friday between 12pm and 9pm & Saturday 10am - 4pm. \rWe aim to create 4 new spaces within the existing open plan.\r\rSpace 1:  3.26m (L) x 1.87m (W) x 2.4m (H)\rSpace 2:  3.26m (L) x 2.21m (W) x 2.4m (H)\rSpace 3:  3.26m (L) x 3.18m (W) x 2.4m (H)\rSpace 4: 6m (L) x 3.9m (W) x 2.4m (H)\r\rThe walls will be constructed of steel stud frames and acoustic plasterboard. Each wall separated with a resilient soundproofing channel. The walls that already exist within the building will remain untouched & the new walls will be free-standing/supporting. The electrics of the existing office will be re-routed to accomodate power to all 4 rooms. There is a small remaining area adjacent to the staircase which is to be used a a waiting area outside of the music rooms. \r\rEach room will be designed for one-on-one student interaction with electronic guitars and drums (volume levels completely monitor able; headphone usage also factored in) but the option of group tuition also a possibility. The largest room will be for group lessons as well as baby-ballet lessons. The flooring in this room will be made of specialist materials that absorb the passage of sound. \r\rThe ceiling is currently office down lighting which will remain the same, however a passage will be made for the new walls to butt against the new ceiling which will require altering the lighting tracks.",
