    "It is considered that the development of the site hereby proposed does not lend itself well for a new dwelling. The proposed development, by reasons of its location on a constrained site and poor design quality appears as an incompatible development which is out of context with the surrounding development. As such, the proposal is unacceptable in design terms, contrary to the principles of sustainable development of the National Planning Policy Framework, Policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan 2021, Policy 28 of the Sutton Local Plan 2018, and the Council's adopted Supplementary Planning Document 14: Creating Locally Distinctive Places. \r",
    "There is insufficient detail to enable a full assessment of the impact on the public highway as no details of the sight lines and swept path analysis have been provided to support the application. Therefore the proposal is contrary to Policies 36 and 37 of the Sutton Local Plan 2018.\r",
    "Without evidence to the contrary, the development has failed to demonstrate a satisfactory energy strategy and water efficiency calculations in compliance with Policies SI 2 and SI 5 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies 31 and 33 of the Sutton Local Plan 2018.",
    "Due to the proximity of the dwelling to the public highway, lack of boundary treatment, limited outlook and relationship between the vehicle parking space and private garden area, the proposal is considered to result in poor quality of amenity for the future occupant and fails to meet the objectives set out in Policy 9 of the Sutton Local Plan 2018."
