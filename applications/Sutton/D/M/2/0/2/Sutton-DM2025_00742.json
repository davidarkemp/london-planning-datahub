The dormer is set back approximately 430mm from the eaves, does not exceed the ridge height of the original roof, and is constructed in materials similar in appearance to the main dwelling. The conversion is used solely as part of the main residence.\r\r2. Removal of two internal chimney breasts on the ground and first floor, with the external chimney stack retained. Appropriate structural supports were installed. The works did not involve any alterations to the external appearance of the property and were completed under permitted development.\r\r3. Garage alterations:\rThe refurbishment of a pre-existing detached garage structure in the rear garden. A pitched roof with a maximum height under 4 metres was added to the original walls. The previously open front elevation was enclosed with brickwork and sliding glazed doors to allow access from the garden. Internal works included the installation of flooring and electricity. The garage remains in its original footprint and is not used as a separate dwelling.--- Status: INV--- Decision: --- Date Decision Issued: ---"
