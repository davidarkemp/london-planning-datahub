    "The development must be begun not later than the expiration of three years beginning with the date hereof.\r\rReason: To comply with Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990, as amended.",
    "All external facing materials, treatments and finishes shall be similar to those of the original building and maintained and retained thereafter. This applies unless differences are shown on the drawings we have approved. \r\rReason: To ensure that the extension harmonises with the existing building and to ensure compliance with Policy 28 of the Sutton Local Plan 2018.",
    "The development must be carried out in accordance with the provisions of the Fire Safety Strategy (Part A) Reasonable Exception Statement, unless otherwise approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority.\r\rReason: To ensure that the development incorporates the necessary fire safety measures in accordance with the Mayor's London Plan Policy D12.\r",
    "Apart from the windows indicated in the hereby approved plans and drawings no further windows shall be installed in the side and rear elevations of the permitted two storey side and rear extension at first floor level.\r\rReason:  To protect the amenities of adjoining occupiers in accordance with Policy 29 of the Sutton Local Plan 2018. \r",
    "Prior to occupation, the first floor flank window(s) in the east-facing elevation(s) of the development hereby approved shall be glazed with obscure glass and fixed shut to a height of 1.7 metres above the finished floor level of the room in which the window is installed in a manner that they cannot be opened and retained thereafter.\r\rReason: To safeguard the current level of privacy enjoyed by the occupants of adjoining properties in accordance with and to ensure compliance with Policy 29 of the Sutton Local Plan 2018.\r\r",
    "The flat roof sections of the rear extension hereby approved shall not be used, all or in part, as a terrace or other amenity space. No railings, fences, walls or other means of enclosure shall be erected on these flat roofs, and no alterations shall be carried out to the rear and side elevations of the application property to form access onto these roofs.\r\rReason: Such a use would be harmful to the existing amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring residential properties as a result of overlooking and loss of privacy and the generation of noise and disturbance contrary to Policy 29 of the Sutton Local Plan 2018.",
    "Apart from the window to the en-suite bathroom, no further windows shall be installed in the side elevation of the permitted two storey side and rear extension at first floor level.\r\rReason:  To protect the amenities of adjoining occupiers in accordance with Policy 29 of the Sutton Local Plan 2018. \r"
