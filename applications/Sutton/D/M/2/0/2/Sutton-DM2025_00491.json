    "The proposed extension, due to its excessive size and close proximity to the boundary would adversely impact 13 Iona Close in terms of appearing overbearing and creating an increased sense of enclosure resulting in a loss of outlook. Also, without evidence to the contrary in the form of a light report, the proposal would result in a loss of light to 13 Iona Close. The proposal is therefore contrary to policy 29 of the Sutton Local Plan 2018."
