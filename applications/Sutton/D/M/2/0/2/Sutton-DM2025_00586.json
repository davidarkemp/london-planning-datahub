    "The development must be begun not later than the expiration of three years beginning with the date hereof.\r\rReason: To comply with Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990, as amended.",
    "All external facing materials, treatments and finishes shall be similar to those of the original building and maintained and retained thereafter. This applies unless differences are shown on the drawings we have approved. \r\rReason: To ensure that the extension harmonises with the existing building and to ensure compliance with Policy 28 of the Sutton Local Plan 2018.",
    "Prior to occupation of the development hereby approved, full details of refuse and recycling storage shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority. The approved details shall be implemented in full prior to occupation of the development and retained thereafter.\r\rReason: To avoid harm to the character and appearance of the streetscene and local area in accordance with policy 28 of the Sutton Local Plan 2018 and to ensure adequate provision of refuse and recycling facilities in the interests of amenity for future and neighbouring occupiers in accordance with policy 29 of the Sutton Local Plan 2018.",
    "Prior to the commencement of development, a scheme for protecting the proposed dwellings from traffic noise shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority. Any works which form part of the scheme shall be completed before any of the dwellings are occupied.\r\rThe Environmental Health Service advises that sound insulation should be provided to ensure that the noise level of 35 dBL Aeq,16 hour in living rooms and bedrooms during the daytime (0700 to 2300 hours) and 30 dBL Aeq,8 hour and 45 dBL AFmax during the night time (2300 to 0700 hours) in bedrooms in accordance with BS8233:2014. Where these levels cannot be met with windows open appropriate acoustic ventilation should be provided so that the room can be sufficiently ventilated. The acoustic performance of any passive vent, variable speed mechanical air supply unit or whole house ventilation must be sufficient to ensure that the noise level standards given above are not compromised.\r\rReason: To ensure that the future occupants of the permitted dwellings are not exposed to unwarranted extraneous noise in accordance with policy 9 of the Sutton Local Plan 2018.",
    "Prior to first occupation of the development, an acoustic report shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority demonstrating that the rating level of any plant, permitted as part of this development, will be at least 5dBA lower than the existing background noise level at any given time of operation. The noise levels shall be measured or predicted 1m externally to any window at the nearest residential facade. Measurements and assessment shall be made according to British Standard 4142:2014.\r\rReason: To ensure that the future occupants of the permitted dwellings are not exposed to unwarranted extraneous noise in accordance with policy 9 of the Sutton Local Plan 2018.",
    "The development hereby approved shall be constructed in accordance with the approved Energy Statement for Planning (Revision 2) prepared Energy Report Ltd and dated 24 April 2025. Prior to first occupation, 'as-built' Standard Assessment Procedure (SAP) outputs must be submitted to the Local Planning Authority and approved in writing to demonstrate that the development has achieved the targeted reduction in CO2 emissions. All of the approved measures must thereafter be retained for as long as the development is in existence.\r\rReason: To comply with Policy 31 of the Sutton Local Plan 2018.",
    "Prior to first occupation of the development, a completed Water Efficiency Calculator for New Dwellings must be submitted to the Local Planning Authority and approved in writing to show that internal potable water consumption for each of the proposed dwellings will be limited to no more than 110 litres per person per day (l/p/d) based on the Government's national calculation method for the purposes of Part G of the Building Regulations.\r\rReason: To comply with Policy 33 of the Sutton Local Plan 2018.",
    "Prior to occupation of the development the cycle parking shall be laid out in accordance with drawing no. 20 Rev D and shall be retained thereafter for the life time of the development.\r\rReason:  To comply with Policy 37 of the Sutton Local Plan.",
    "The development must be carried out in accordance with the provisions of the Fire Statement Form completed by 3Safety dated 23/03/2025.\r\rReason: To ensure that the development incorporates the necessary fire safety measures in accordance with the Mayor's London Plan Policy D12."
