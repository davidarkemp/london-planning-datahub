This applies unless differences are shown on the drawings we have approved. \r\rReason: To ensure that the extension harmonises with the existing building and to ensure compliance with Policy 28 of the Sutton Local Plan 2018.",
    "The development must be carried out in accordance with the provisions of the Fire Safety Statement 291 WELBECK ROAD, CARSHALTON, SM5 1LN, unless otherwise approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority.\r\rReason: To ensure that the development incorporates the necessary fire safety measures in accordance with the Mayor's London Plan Policy D12.\r",

No railings, fences, walls or other means of enclosure shall be erected on these flat roofs, and no alterations shall be carried out to the rear and side elevations of the application property to form access onto these roofs.\r\rReason: Such a use would be harmful to the existing amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring residential properties as a result of overlooking and loss of privacy and the generation of noise and disturbance contrary to Policy 29 of the Sutton Local Plan 2018.",
    "Prior to occupation, the proposed first floor side facing window, shall be fitted with obscure glazing and be non-opening up to a height of 1.7m above floor level  and shall be retained and maintained thereafter. \r\rReason: To protect the amenities of adjoining occupiers and to ensure compliance with Policy 29 of the Sutton Local Plan 2018.\r",
