    "The proposed illuminated advertisement, due to the size, siting, illumination and position adjacent to the junction between Langley Road and the A24 London Road, located in a busy street environment and close to a zebra crossing will distract drivers and cyclist attention from the road conditions and could result in the harm to safety of drivers, cyclist and pedestrians contrary to Policy T4 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy 36 of the Sutton Local Plan 2018.",
    "Due to the size and placement of the proposed illuminated advert, it would cause negative impacts on people with invisible disability with high sensory restrictions who find bright light and bright colours disturbing, which is contrary to Policy T2 of the London Plan since the proposal would then not be considered as 'high quality' or committed to having a 'fundamental role in moving people around safely'."
