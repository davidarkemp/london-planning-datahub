    "The proposed development fails to deliver safe and suitable access for HGVs to enter and egress from the site. The proposed layout creates the risk of conflicts within the site, as well as the risk of collision with plant storing explosive substances. Consequently, the proposal is contrary to Policy T7(G) and D11(c) of the London Plan 2021, Policy 36 of the Sutton Local Plan 2018, Policy WP5(C)(viii) and (x) of the South London Waste Plan 2022, and NPPF 115(b).",
    "The proposed development would give rise to a significant and unacceptable impact on the transport network through materially increasing the number of HGV movements. In seeking to justify that impact the applicant adopts a flawed approach of comparing those impacts against the impacts predicted to arise from a different consented development (under Ref: DM2018/01865). That development does not represent a fall-back position as there is no reasonable prospect of that development being carried out, and in any event limited weight should be attached to that permission even if it were a material consideration. Against the 'do nothing' scenario, the impacts from this proposal are significant and unacceptable. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy T4 of the London Plan 2021, Policy 36 of the Sutton Local Plan 2018, Policy WP5(C)(viii) of the South London WastePlan 2022, and NPPF paragraph 116.",
    "The proposed development will give rise to residual effects on odour to the detriment of sensitive receptors, such as pedestrians, schools, and dwellings. Odour will be emitted from food wastes transported on roads within residential areas on route to the site. These emissions were not identified or assessed by the applicant. Existing pollution control regimes are not reasonably capable of regulating them either. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy SI8(E)(4) of the London Plan 2021, Policy 29(f) of the Sutton Local Plan 2018, Policy WP5(C)(iv), (vi) and (xi) of the South London Waste Plan 2022, and NPPF paragraphs 135(f) and 198."
