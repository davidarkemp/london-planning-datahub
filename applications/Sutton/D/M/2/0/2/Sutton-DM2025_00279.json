This condition is required to be pre-commencement to ensure that materials are considered at a early stage of the construction process and it is important that details are agreed at this stage as this could potentially impact on construction methods.\"",

The development shall be constructed in accordance with the approved statement.\r\rReason: To ensure that the proposed development does not interfere with the free flow of traffic and conditions of safety on the public highway, and to ensure the development process does not have a significant adverse impact on the amenities of nearby residential properties in accordance with Policy 36 of the Sutton Local Plan 2018.",

The amended Energy Statement must consider the potential for air source heat pump (ASHP) technology and provide details of emissions reductions at each stage of the energy hierarchy using the Mayor's carbon emissions reporting spreadsheet or similar.\r\rReason: To comply with Policy 31 of the Sutton Local Plan 2018",
