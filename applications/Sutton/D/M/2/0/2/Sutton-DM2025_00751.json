Where this is not possible the type and treatment of the materials to be used shall be agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority prior to any above ground works being carried out.  \r\rReason: To ensure that the extension harmonises with the existing building and to ensure compliance with Policy 28 of the Sutton Local Plan 2018.\r",

No railings, fences, walls or other means of enclosure shall be erected on this flat roof, and no alterations shall be carried out to the rear elevation of the application property to form access onto the roof.  \r\rReason: Such a use could be harmful to the existing amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring residential properties as a result of overlooking and loss of privacy and the generation of noise and disturbance in accordance with Policy 29 of the Sutton Local Plan.",
