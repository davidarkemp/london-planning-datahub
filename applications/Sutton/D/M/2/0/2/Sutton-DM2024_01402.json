As such the proposal would be unacceptable in principle, contrary to Policy 7, 13, 28 and 32 of the Sutton Local Plan 2018.",
    "The proposed development has failed to satisfactorily demonstrate that the highway trees can be safety retained and would result in an unacceptable loss to trees which contribute to the visual amenity and character of the street scene contrary to Policy 28 of the Sutton Local Plan 2018.",
    "The proposed development fails to satisfactorily demonstrate the development would not result in an increase in flood risk to neighbouring occupiers and future occupiers of the development contrary to Policy 32 of the Sutton Local Plan 2018.",
    "The proposal, due to the lack of a signed S106 agreement to secure off site biodiversity credits would fail to meet the aims and objectives as set out in Policy G6 of the London Plan (2021) and Policy 26 of the Sutton Local Plan (2018).",
    "Without evidence to the contrary, the applicant has failed to demonstrate that the new development provides sufficient access arrangements for the proposed off street parking space due to the presence of the street tree and lamp column. As such, the application would be contrary to Policy T4 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy 36 of the Sutton Local Plan 2018.",
    "By reason of excessive width and design features of the dwelling within this restricted site, the proposed development would appear unduly prominent within the Dalmeny Road street scene contrary to the character and appearance of the street scene. The development would fail to comply with Policy D4 of London Plan 2021, Policy 28 of the Sutton Local Plan 2018 and guidance set out in SPD14."
