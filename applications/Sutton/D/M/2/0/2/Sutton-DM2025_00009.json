    "The proposed parking layout, given that future occupants would either be required to reverse off the site onto the Transport for London Road Network (TLRN) or would be required to reverse off the TLRN onto the site, would unacceptably lead to concerns of unsafety and increased road danger contrary to London Plan Policy T4F. Without evidence to the contrary, it is therefore considered that the proposal would cause harm in terms of highway and pedestrian safety, which also has the potential to impact on the surrounding road network in terms of parking overspill, and the proposal is therefore contrary to policy T4F of the London Plan 2021 and policies 36 and 37 of the Sutton Local Plan 2018.",
    "The site represents an inappropriate location for a large House in Multiple Occupation (HMO) and would be contrary to Policy 10 (c) paragraphs (ii) and (iv) of the Sutton Local Plan 2018 which, amongst other things, promotes the delivery of large House in Multiple Occupation (HMOs) within Areas of Potential Intensification. The proposal would constitute an unacceptable loss of a single family dwelling which would be unsuitable for conversion to form a large HMO and is therefore contrary to policy 10 of the Sutton Local Plan 2018."
