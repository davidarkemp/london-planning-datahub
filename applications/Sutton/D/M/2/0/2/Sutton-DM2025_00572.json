    "The development must be begun not later than the expiration of three years beginning with the date hereof.\r\rReason: To comply with Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990, as amended.",
    "All external facing materials, treatments and finishes shall be similar to those of the original building and maintained and retained thereafter. This applies unless differences are shown on the drawings we have approved. \r\rReason: To ensure that the extension harmonises with the existing building and to ensure compliance with Policy 28 of the Sutton Local Plan 2018.",
    "The flat roof of the extension hereby approved shall not be used, all or in part, as a terrace or other amenity space. No railings, fences, walls or other means of enclosure shall be erected on this flat roof, and no alterations shall be carried out to the elevation of the application property to form access onto the roof.\r\rReason: Such a use could be harmful to the existing amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring residential properties as a result of overlooking and loss of privacy and the generation of noise and disturbance contrary to Policy 29 of the Sutton Local Plan 2018.",
    "The development must be carried out in accordance with the provisions of the Planning Fire Statement prepared by Salstan Architects dated April 23.\r\rReason: To ensure that the development incorporates the necessary fire safety measures in accordance with the Mayor's London Plan Policy D12."
