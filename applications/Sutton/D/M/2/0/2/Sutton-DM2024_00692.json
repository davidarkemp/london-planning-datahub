    "The proposed development, by reason of insufficient heritage analysis and justification, poor design and disproportionate scale and massing, would result in a form of development which fails to respect the prevailing scale of development in the surrounding area. The public benefits would fail to outweigh the benefits of the scheme and adversely harm the appearance of the street scene, non-designated heritage assets and the Cheam Village Conservation Area contrary to the aims and objectives of the Nationally Planning Policy Framework, Policies HC1 and D4 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies 28 and 30 of the Sutton Local Plan 2018.",
    "The proposed vehicular access and parking spaces for the two dwellings would result in unsafe highway and parking arrangements to the detriment of future occupiers and pedestrians. Insufficient evidence has been submitted to demonstrate the proposed development would not result in overspill parking to the detriment of the safe and efficient operation of surrounding roads. The development is therefore contrary to the aims and objectives of Policy D6 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies 36 and 37 of the Sutton Local Plan 2018.",
    "The proposed parking arrangements and proposed bike storage would, by reason of insufficient manoeuvring space, obstruct the safe and efficient presentation of refuse and recycling bins and would result in unsatisfactory collection arrangements and/or pedestrian and highway safety contrary to Policy D6 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "The proposed development fails to provide satisfactory quality of living accommodation internally for future occupiers as it would not meet minimum space standards or internal floor to ceiling heights and the internal layout would lead to cramped living conditions contrary to the aims and objectives of Policy D6 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy 9 of the Sutton Local Plan 2018."
