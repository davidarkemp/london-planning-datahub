    "A1(a) permission to use the dwellinghouse as a dwellinghouse has not been granted only by virtue of Class M, N, P, PA or Q of Part 3 of this Schedule (changes of use);",

    "A1(c) the height of the part of the dwelling house enlarged, improved or altered would not exceed the height of the highest part of the roof of the existing dwellinghouse",
    "A1(d) the height of the eaves of the part of the dwelling house enlarged, improved or altered would not exceed the height of the eaves of the existing dwellinghouse",
    "A1(e) the enlarged part of the dwellinghouse would not extend beyond a wall which  -\r(i) forms the principal elevation of the original dwellinghouse; or\r(ii) fronts a highway and forms a side elevation of the original dwellinghouse",
    "A1(g) for a dwellinghouse not on article 2(3) land nor on a site of special scientific interest, the enlarged part of the dwellinghouse would have a single storey and\r(i) not extend beyond the rear wall of the original dwellinghouse by more than 8 metres (detached dwellinghouse) or 6 metres (other dwellinghouse), or\r(ii) not exceed 4 metres in height\r(iii) the requirements of A.4 have been met",
    "A1(i) if the proposed extension is within 2m of the boundary of the curtilage of the dwellinghouse, the height of the eaves would not exceed 3 metres",
    "A1(j) the enlarged part of the dwellinghouse would extend beyond a wall forming a side elevation of the original dwellinghouse and would not - \r(i) exceed 4 metres in height\r(ii) have more than one storey or\r(iii) have a width greater than half the width of the original dwellinghouse",
    "A1(ja) the total enlargement (being the enlarged part together with any existing enlargement of the original dwellinghouse to which it will be joined) would not exceed the limits set out in sub paragraphs (e) to (j)",
    "A1(k) Would not consist of or include - \r(i) construction or provision of a veranda, balcony or raised platform \r(ii) the installation, alteration or replacement of a microwave antenna or \r(iii) the installation, alteration or replacement of chimney, flue or soil and vent pipe\r(iv) an alteration to any part of the roof of the dwellinghouse",
    "A3(a) the materials used in any exterior work (other than materials used in the construction of a conservatory) shall be of a similar appearance to those used in the construction of the exterior of the existing dwellinghouse",
    "A3(b) any upper floor window located in a wall or roof slope forming a side elevation of the dwellinghouse shall be -\r(i) obscure glazed and\r(ii) non opening unless the parts of the window which can be opened are more than 1.7 metres above the floor of the room in which the window is installed;",
    "A1(l) the dwellinghouse has not been built under Part 20 of this Schedule (construction of new dwellinghouses).",
    "The proposed single storey rear extension, by reason of its excessive depth and close proximity to the shared boundary would have an adverse impact on the amenities of the adjoining property at No 102 Lynwood Drive by way of a loss of outlook and would create an un-neighbourly sense of enclosure. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policy 29 of Sutton Local Plan 2018.\r",
    "The proposed plans show the addition of a front entrance porch. This type of extension cannot be considered under Schedule 2, Part 1 Class A of the GDPO and as such cannot form part of this type of application."
