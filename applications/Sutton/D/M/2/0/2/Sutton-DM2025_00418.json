    "A1(f) subject to paragraph (g), the enlarged part of the dwellinghouse would have a single storey and\r(i) not extend beyond the rear wall of the original dwellinghouse by more than 4 metres (detached dwellinghouse) or 3 metres (other dwellinghouse), or\r(ii) not exceed 4 metres in height",
    "A1(g) for a dwellinghouse not on article 2(3) land nor on a site of special scientific interest, the enlarged part of the dwellinghouse would have a single storey and\r(i) not extend beyond the rear wall of the original dwellinghouse by more than 8 metres (detached dwellinghouse) or 6 metres (other dwellinghouse), or\r(ii) not exceed 4 metres in height\r(iii) the requirements of A.4 have been met",

    "A1(l) the dwellinghouse has not been built under Part 20 of this Schedule (construction of new dwellinghouses).",
    "The proposed single storey rear extension, by reason of its excessive depth and location along the shared side boundary, would result in adverse impact on the amenities of the occupiers of 94 Benhill Road, the adjoining property to the south, in terms of loss of visual outlook, loss of light, overbearing presence and sense of enclosure. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policy 29 of Sutton Local Plan 2018."
