The Bin Store is located adjacent to Block R (Camlet House) and the Cycle Store is located adjacent to the Energy Centre that adjoins Block R (Camlet House). The Gas Kiosk is located below Block R (Camlet House). The Utilities Network required the Gas Kiosk to be relocated adjacent to the Energy Centre in the location of the Cycle Store. This is where the Gas Kiosk has been built. There is a sewer easement that runs in between Block R (Camlet House) and Block F (Perkin Court). This restricts the relocation of the Bin and Cycle Store. The only location that is suitable to avoid the easement is to the east of Block R (Camlet House). The new proposed location for the Bin Store is to the east of Block R (Camlet House) adjacent to the boundary, with the cycle store being proposed to the north of Block F (Perkin Court) adjacent to the boundary.
