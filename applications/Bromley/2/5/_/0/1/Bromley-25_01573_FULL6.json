The extension is designed to create an open-plan living space that seamlessly integrates the house with the rear garden, providing a modern and functional environment for contemporary family living.\r\rThe extension will not extend beyond the current rear wall of the property. The side wall along the boundary will have a maximum height of 3 metres with a flat roof and roof light. The proposed rear elevation will be finished with brick to match the colour of the existing brick walls.",
