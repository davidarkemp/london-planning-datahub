  "description": "TG1 - Trees along the main pathway and around buildings, following the pathway that roughly follows the perimeter of the site. The scope of this work is to remove any large dead, dangerous or hazardous branches over a diameter of 75mm and make any unstable trees near pathways safer by felling or monolithing said trees. Upon inspection, there were a few trees where the root plate had lifted, most likely due to stormy conditions - these will need to be felled to ensure stability. On the map, some of the larger trees have been plotted:-\r\rT2 Common Oak - Remove major deadwood with diameters exceeding 75mm and remove hazardous beams.\rT3 Common Oak - Monolith to 3m (dead tree).\rT4 Common Oak (shifted root plate but still standing) - Fell to ground level.\rT5 Fallen Common Oak - Clear fallen tree.\rT6 Common Oak - Remove major deadwood diameter exceeding 75mm.\rT7 Common Oak - Remove major deadwood diameter exceeding 75mm.\rT8 Fallen Oak (shifted root plate but still standing) - Fell tree to ground level.\rT9 Dying Oak - Monolith to 3m.\rT10 Common Oak - Remove major deadwood with diameters exceeding 75mm.\rTG11 Trees around car park fouling power lines - Clear power lines by 2m and remove large diameter deadwood.\rSUBJECT TO TPO 210 (12.7.1984)",
