Lift the lower crown to create a clear stem of approximately 1.5m above ground level.\rT3 Self Seeded Ash on rear boundary - Section fell as close to ground level as possible and poison stump with appropriate use of herbicide (eco plugs) to prevent regrowth.\rT4 Apple towards rear boundary - Crown reduce the height and radial spread of the canopy by up to 1.5m and shape accordingly. Remove major deadwood.\rT5 Self-seeded Plum on rear left hand boundary, growing very close to boundary wall - Section fell as close to ground level as possible. \rT6 Plum on rear left hand boundary in neighbouring garden (previously reduced on tree owners side) - Crown reduce the radial spread of the canopy by up to 3m on client side only, cutting back to appropriate growing points where possible.
