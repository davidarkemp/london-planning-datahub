  "site_name": "KFC DRIVE-THRU,",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "i. No advertisement is to be displayed without the permission of the owner of the site or any other person with an interest in the site entitled to grant permission.",
    "ii. No advertisement shall be sited or displayed so as to:-",
    "(a) endanger persons using any highway, railway, waterway, dock, harbour or aerodrome (civil or military);",
    "(b) obscure, or hinder the ready interpretation of any traffic sign, railway signal or aid to navigation by water or air; or",
    "(c) hinder the operation of any device used for the purpose of security or surveillance or for measuring the speed of any vehicle.",
    "iii. Any advertisement displayed, and any site used for the display of advertisements, shall be maintained in a condition that does not impair the visual amenity of the site.",
    "iv. Any structure or hoarding erected or used principally for the purpose of displaying advertisements shall be maintained in a condition that does not endanger the public.",
    "v. Where an advertisement is required under these",
    "The maximum luminance of the illuminated fascia signs hereby permitted shall not exceed 600 cd/m2.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To comply with the recommendations of the Institute of Public Lighting Engineers Technical Report No. 5 (Third Edition) in the interests of amenity, and in order that the development accords with  the  Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policy DC65",
    "The development hereby permitted shall not be carried out otherwise than in complete accordance with the approved plans (as set out on page one of this decision notice).",
    "Reason:-",
    "The Local Planning Authority consider it essential that the whole of the development is carried out and that no departure whatsoever is made from the details approved, since the development would not necessarily be acceptable if partly carried out or carried out differently in any degree from the details submitted.  Also, in order that the development accords with Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policy DC61.",
    "The Banner Frame (Item O Drawing Number 28543) shall not be illuminated at any time.",
    "Reason: In the interests of highway safety.",
    "Illumination for the proposed signage must be below the limit set out in by the Institute of Lighting Professionals (ILP), formerly the ILE, within its technical note number 5 \"The brightness of illuminated advertisement\", because TfL wants to ensure drivers are not distracted and so there is no adverse impact on highway safety.",
    "Reason: In the interests of highway safety.",
    "The proposed signage must not have any intermittent light source, moving feature, animation or exposed cold cathode tubing, because TfL wants to ensure drivers are not distracted and so there is no adverse impact on highway safety.",
    "Reason: In the interests of highway safety.",
    "If the advert is proposed to rotate its display, the following is recommended: the frequency of change in the displayed image is no greater than 30 seconds, and a transition from one image to another whereby the ending display is phased out and its replacement phased in over a period of no more than 3 seconds, because TfL wants to ensure drivers are not distracted and so there is no adverse impact on highway safety",
    "Reason: In the interests of highway safety.",
    "The footway and carriageway on A12 Eastern Avenue must not be blocked during the installation of the proposed signage. Temporary obstructions during the proposed works must be kept to a minimum and should not encroach on the clear space needed to provide safe passage for pedestrians or obstruct the flow of traffic on A12 Eastern Avenue.",
    "Reason: In the interests of highway safety.",
    "All vehicles associated with the installation of the proposed signage must only park/ stop at permitted locations and within the time periods permitted by existing on-street restrictions.",
    "Reason: In the interests of highway safety.",
    "No skips or construction materials shall be kept on the footway or carriageway on the TLRN at any time.",
    "Reason: In the interests of highway safety.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35(2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management) Order 2015: No significant problems were identified during the consideration of the application, and therefore it has been determined in accordance with paragraph 38 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2018."
