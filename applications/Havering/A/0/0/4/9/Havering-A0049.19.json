    "iv. Any structure or hoarding erected or used principally for the purpose of displaying advertisements shall be maintained in a condition that does not endanger the public.",
    "v. Where an advertisement is required under these",
    "The development hereby permitted shall not be carried out otherwise than in complete accordance with the approved plans (as set out on page one of this decision notice).",
    "Reason:-",
    "The Local Planning Authority consider it essential that the whole of the development is carried out and that no departure whatsoever is made from the details approved, since the development would not necessarily be acceptable if partly carried out or carried out differently in any degree from the details submitted.  Also, in order that the development accords with Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policy DC61.",
    "The maximum luminance of the signage hereby permitted shall not exceed 200 cd/m2.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To comply with the recommendations of the Institute of Public Lighting Engineers Technical Report No. 5 (Third Edition) in the interests of amenity, and in order that the development accords with  the  Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policy DC65",
    "Statement Required by Article 35(2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management) Order 2015: No significant problems were identified during the consideration of the application, and therefore it has been determined in accordance with paragraph 38 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2018.",
    "The signs shown as type D (excluding the on-building wall sign) and type E on submitted plans are considered, due to their number and siting, to give rise to a cluttered and visually obtrusive appearance, harmful to the spacious character of the streetscene. The proposal would harm the visual amenity of the surrounding area contrary to Policies DC61 and DC65 of the LDF.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments,  but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to the agent in writing on 22/7/20."
