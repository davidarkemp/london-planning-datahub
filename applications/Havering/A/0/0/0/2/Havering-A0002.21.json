    "The proposed fascia signage as a result of inappropriate use of illumination would appear as an unduly prominent feature and result in detrimental impact upon the visual amenity of the site, and detracts from the setting of the Gidea Park Conservation Area and fails to preserve or enhance the character and appearance of the Gidea Park Conservation Area therefore the proposal is considered contrary to the implementation of Policies DC65 and DC68 of the London Borough of Havering's Adopted Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policy 2008, the National Planning Policy Framework 2018 and Section 66 and 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: In accordance with paragraph 38 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2018, improvements required to make the proposal acceptable were negotiated with  Mr Dean Goodwin via email on the 23rd February 2021. The revisions involved removing the illumination aspect from the proposal. The applicant declined to make the suggested revisions."
