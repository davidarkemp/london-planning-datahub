    "In the absence of evidence otherwise it is considered that the proposed digital screen would lead to increased risk to pedestrian and highway safety through the siting and design of the digital panel and position and proximity angled towards oncoming traffic where it would potentially pose a distraction to drivers who should be alert. The proposals are therefore contrary to Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 Policy 23, London Plan Policies Policy T2 and D8 which each fundamentally require the public realm to be safe.",
