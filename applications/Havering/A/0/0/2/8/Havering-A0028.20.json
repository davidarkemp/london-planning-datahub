  "decision_conditions": [
    "The development hereby permitted shall not be carried out otherwise than in complete accordance with the approved plans (as set out on page one of this decision notice).",
    "Reason:-",
    "The Local Planning Authority consider it essential that the whole of the development is carried out and that no departure whatsoever is made from the details approved, since the development would not necessarily be acceptable if partly carried out or carried out differently in any degree from the details submitted.  Also, in order that the development accords with Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policy DC61.",
    "i. No advertisement is to be displayed without the permission of the owner of the site or any other person with an interest in the site entitled to grant permission.",
    "ii. No advertisement shall be sited or displayed so as to:-",
    "(a) endanger persons using any highway, railway, waterway, dock, harbour or aerodrome (civil or military);",
    "(b) obscure, or hinder the ready interpretation of any traffic sign, railway signal or aid to navigation by water or air; or",
    "(c) hinder the operation of any device used for the purpose of security or surveillance or for measuring the speed of any vehicle.",
    "iii. Any advertisement displayed, and any site used for the display of advertisements, shall be maintained in a condition that does not impair the visual amenity of the site.",
    "iv. Any structure or hoarding erected or used principally for the purpose of displaying advertisements shall be maintained in a condition that does not endanger the public.",
    "v. Where an advertisement is required under these",
    "The maximum luminance of the illuminated sign hereby permitted shall not exceed 600cd/m2.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To comply with the recommendations of the Institute of Public Lighting Engineers Technical Report No. 5 (Third Edition) in the interests of amenity, and in order that the development accords with  the  Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policy DC65",
    "It is noted that the proposed plans include changes to the facade treatment that have not been approved. There is an existing approval for changes to the facade (P1326.20), which differ from the changes shown in the drawings associated with this application. Whilst there are changes shown on the elevation drawings, the current submission relates solely to the display of advertisements (i.e. fascia sign). In no way would the granting of advertisement consent constitute permission to make the other changes.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: No significant problems were identified during the consideration of the application, and therefore it has been determined in accordance with paragraph 38 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2019."
