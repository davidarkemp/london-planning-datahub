    "The proposed display panel, by reason of its siting and size, would be a dominant and visually intrusive feature which would contribute to visual clutter and therefore be harmful to the visual amenity of the locality. It is therefore considered not to comply with Policy 26 of the Havering Local Plan 2016-2031, London Plan Policy D4 and the objectives of the NPPF.",
    "The proposed display panel, by reason of its positioning and illuminence would be harmful to highway safety.  It is therefore not in compliance with London Plan transport policy and the Mayor's Transport Strategy based on Policy T2, Policy D8, Vision Zero and highway safety grounds.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, it was necessary to issue a decision as close to the statutory timeframe as possible as opposed to seeking amendments which would have significantly delayed the application."
