    "Compliance with the five standard conditions as defined in regulation 2(1) and set out in schedule 2 of the Town and Country Planning: (Control of Advertisements) (England) Regulations 2007",
    "The maximum luminance of the internally illuminated signs hereby permitted shall not exceed 600 cd/m2.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To comply with the recommendations of the Institute of Public Lighting Engineers Technical Report No. 5 (Third Edition) in the interests of amenity, and in order that the development accords with  the  Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policy DC65",
    "The development hereby permitted shall not be carried out otherwise than in complete accordance with the approved plans (as set out on page one of this decision notice).",
    "Reason:-",
    "The Local Planning Authority consider it essential that the whole of the development is carried out and that no departure whatsoever is made from the details approved, since the development would not necessarily be acceptable if partly carried out or carried out differently in any degree from the details submitted.  Also, in order that the development accords with Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policy DC61.",
    "The proposed signage must not have any intermittent light source, moving feature, animation or exposed cold cathode tubing, because TfL wants to ensure drivers are not distracted and so there is no adverse impact on highway safety.",
    "Reason: In the interests of highway safety.",
    "The footway and carriageway on the TLRN must not be blocked during the installation and maintenance of the signs. Temporary obstructions during the installation must be kept to a minimum and should not encroach on the clear space needed to provide safe passage for pedestrians or obstruct the flow of traffic.",
    "Reason: In the interests of highway safety.",
    "All vehicles associated with the installation and maintenance of the signs must only park/ stop at permitted locations and within the time periods permitted by existing on-street restrictions.",
    "Reason: In the interests of highway safety.",
    "No skips or construction materials shall be kept on the footway or carriageway on the TLRN at any time.",
    "Reason: In the interests of highway safety.",
    "Statement Required by Article 31 (cc) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management) Order 2010: No significant problems were identified during the consideration of the application, and therefore it has been determined in accordance with paragraphs 186-187 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2019."
