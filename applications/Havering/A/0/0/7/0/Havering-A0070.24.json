    "The siting of the digital panel would introduce a visually intrusive and prominent feature which would detract from the open character and appearance of this location and would contribute to visual clutter to the detriment of the visual amenity of the locality. The application fails to consider also how the proposals would integrate with wider aspirations of providing a high quality environment in the strategic redevelopment area. It is therefore considered not to comply with Policy 26 of the Havering Local Plan 2016-2031, the objectives for the Rainham West SSA, London Plan Policies D4 and D8 and the objectives of the NPPF.",
    "In the absence of evidence otherwise, it is considered that the proposals would lead to increased risk to pedestrian and highway safety through the siting and design of the digital panel and position and proximity angled towards oncoming traffic where it would potentially pose a distraction to drivers who should be alert. The proposals are therefore contrary to Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 Policy 23, London Plan Policies Policy T2 and D8 which each fundamentally require the public realm to be safe.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to the agent in writing 11-02-2025."
