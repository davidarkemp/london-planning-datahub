    "Compliance with the Standard Conditions imposed by Regulation 13 and Schedule 1 of the Town and Country Planning: (Control of Advertisements) Regulations 1992 (set out in Notes 10 to 15 overleaf).",
    "The maximum luminance of the eastern free standing sign (HD1B), sales-building  entrance sign (HD3A), graphic signs (HD4), panel signs (HD6) and wall-mounted signs (HD20) hereby permitted shall not exceed 800cd/m2,1000cd/m2,1600cd/m2, 1200cd/m2 and 1200cd/m2 respectively.",
    "Reason:",
    "To comply with the recommendations of the Institute of Public Lighting Engineers Technical Report No. 5 (Second Edition) in the interests of amenity.",
    "The westernmost of the two free-standing signs (HD1B), at approximately 130metres from the main part of the service station, would be unrelated to the petrol filling station it is proposed to serve and would, accordingly, extend to an unacceptable degree the visual impact of the service station into the Metropolitan Green Belt, compromising its open, rural character contrary to Policy GRB2 of the Havering Unitary Development Plan."
