    "The proposed installation of a safety rail would, by reasons of physical intervention into the historic fabric of the listed bridge, specifically through the insertion of nine metal posts into the original stone coping, adversely impact on the special architectural and historic interest of the listed structure, and diminish the visual integrity and aesthetic value of the bridge, resulting in harm to the integrity of the designated heritage asset, contrary to the Section 16 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990, NPPF, London Plan Policy HC1, Policy 28 of the Local Plan 2021 and the Heritage Supplementary Planning Document.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, it was necessary to issue a decision as close to the statutory timeframe as possible as opposed to seeking amendments which would have significantly delayed the application."
