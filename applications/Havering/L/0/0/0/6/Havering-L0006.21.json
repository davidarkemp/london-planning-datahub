    "The development to which this consent relates must be commenced not later than three years from the date of this consent.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To comply with the requirements of Section 18(1) of the Planning (Listed Building and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended by Section 51 of the Planning Compulsory Purchase Act 2004).",
    "The development hereby permitted shall not be carried out otherwise than in complete accordance with the approved plans (as set out on page one of this decision notice).",
    "Reason:-",
    "The Local Planning Authority consider it essential that the whole of the development is carried out and that no departure whatsoever is made from the details approved, since the development would not necessarily be acceptable if partly carried out or carried out differently in any degree from the details submitted.  Also, in order that the development accords with Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policy DC61.",
    "Prior to commencement of the development hereby permitted, a full schedule of works shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority to support the details provided as part of the current submission.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To preserve the character and appearance of the Listed Building and its setting, to safeguard the especial character and historical interest of the heritage asset and in order that the development accords with Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policy DC67.",
    "The proposed extension hereby approved shall be constructed in accordance with the materials detailed under Section 15 of the application form unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason: To ensure that the appearance of the proposed development will harmonise with the character of the surrounding area and comply with Policy DC61 of the Development Control Policies Development Plan Document",
    "All new work and works of making good to the retained fabric whether internal or external shall be finished to match the existing original work with regard to the methods used and to material, colour, texture and profile and in the case of brickwork facebond and pointing.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To preserve the character and appearance of the Listed Building and its setting, and in order that the development accords with Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policy DC67.",
    "No works shall take place in relation to any of the development hereby approved until samples of the external finishing materials are submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority and thereafter the development shall be constructed with the approved materials.",
    "Reason:-",
    "Insufficient information has been supplied with the application to judge the appropriateness of the external finishing materials to be used.  Submission of samples prior to commencement will safeguard the appearance of the premises and the character of the immediate area and will ensure that the development accords with the Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policies DC54 and DC61.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35(2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management) Order 2015: No significant problems were identified during the consideration of the application, and therefore it has been determined in accordance with paragraph 38 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2018."
