  "site_name": "The Chapel",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed replacement dormer window on the front elevation, would by reason of the loss of historic fabric, prominent location, with no condition survey, result in an unjustified harm to the special architectural interest of the listed building, failing to preserve and/or enhance the special character of the listed building, contrary to Section 16 of the NPPF and Sections 16 and 66 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation areas) Act 1990. And  would materially and unacceptably detract from the character and appearance of the application premises, to the detriment of the street-scene. The proposal would neither preserve, nor enhance the special character of the St Leonard's Hornchurch Conservation Area and is therefore contrary to Policy HC1 of the London Plan and Policy 28 of the Local Plan 2021 and the Heritage Supplementary Planning Document.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, it was necessary to issue a decision as close to the statutory timeframe as possible as opposed to seeking amendments which would have significantly delayed the application."
