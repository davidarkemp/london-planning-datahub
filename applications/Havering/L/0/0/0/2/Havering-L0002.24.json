    "The development to which this consent relates must be commenced not later than three years from the date of this consent.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To comply with the requirements of Section 18(1) of the Planning (Listed Building and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended by Section 51 of the Planning Compulsory Purchase Act 2004).",
    "The development hereby permitted shall not be carried out otherwise than in complete accordance with the approved plans (as set out on page one of this decision notice).",
    "Reason:-",
    "For the avoidance of doubt and to ensure that the development is carried out as approved.",
    "The local planning authority shall be notified in writing and provided with details of the outcome of the proposed investigative works. Should any additional works, other than what has been included within this application, be deemed necessary following the investigative works, further details of such works and proposed methodology should be submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority prior to the commencement of such additional works.",
    "Reason:-",
    "In order to ensure that the works are carried out appropriately by heritage professionals to enhance the appearance of the heritage asset in harmony with the character of the surrounding area and comply with Policy 28 of the Local Plan 2021.",
    "The Local Planning Authority shall be notified in writing at least seven days before the date on which any additional approved works, other than what has been included within this application, are proposed to commence to provide an opportunity, if required, for the inspection and site meeting involving a representative from the local planning authority and the applicant or their agent.",
