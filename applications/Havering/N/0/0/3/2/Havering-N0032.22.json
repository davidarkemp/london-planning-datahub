    "The requested non-material amendment to planning permission P0433.17 which was allowed under appeal, dated 15/01/2019 to move house numbers 3 and 4 back by 3000mm represents a material change to the previously approved scheme, which requires planning permission in its own right.",
    "The alteration cannot therefore be regarded as a minor amendment in this instance because the dwellings would be situated closer to the rear boundaries of dwellings along Wainfleet Avenue and the rear garden space of dwelling's nos. 3 and 4 would be reduced. The submission of a fresh planning application is therefore deemed necessary in this case."
