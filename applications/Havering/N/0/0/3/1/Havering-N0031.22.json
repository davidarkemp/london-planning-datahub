    "The alterations to the staircase design to the roof would go beyond the scope of a non-material minor amendment and would require separate planning consent, particularly as the original application (P2060.16) has expired. In addition, the alterations to the staircase roof design would change the form and siting of the proposal and its appearance in the streetscene. Furthermore, there is a reasonable expectation that neighbouring properties would be consulted on this matter, particularly as the alterations to the staircase design would be located closer to the south eastern boundary of the site. As such the alterations shown cannot be considered as non-material and require separate planning consent."
