  "decision_conditions": [
    "The  requested non-material amendment to planning permission P0001.22 dated 08/04/2022 to permit removal of angled wall to adjoining neighbour and the extension to the extent of 4m would materially affect the character and scale of the development. As such, it is considered to result in a material impact upon the amenity of the neighbouring occupiers at no. 19 Queens Gardens. The amendment sought thus represents a material change to the development previously approved, which requires planning permission in its own right.",
    "The alteration therefore cannot be regarded as a non-material amendment and, therefore, the submission of a fresh planning application is deemed necessary in this case.",
    "It is noted that the drawing titles do not specify which set of plans were approved under P0001.22. The drawing '0001.101 (REV. P2)' depict the plans which were approved under P0001.22."
