    "The extent of changes to the scheme would go beyond the scope of a non-material minor amendment and incorporate matters which require further consideration. The changes to the internal layout would in the opinion of officers materially change the approved scheme and the amenity of future occupants and surrounding occupiers would require full assessment. Furthermore, the plans submitted are suggestive of alterations to the front elevation and roof accommodation/dormer. There is a reasonable expectation that neighbouring properties would be consulted on such matters. As such the alterations shown as a whole cannot be considered as non-material and require a fresh application for planning permission (or S73 application).",
