    "The amendments sought are considered to materially affect the character and nature of the development previously approved and cannot be regarded as a minor amendment.",
    "The Juliette balcony opening/window will increase in size and there is the potential for overlooking. This change would require public consultation, as such there is a  material difference from the scale and design in comparison with the approved scheme. In view of this, the proposed deviations from the approved drawings are not considered to be non-material in nature.",
    "The submission of a fresh planning application is therefore deemed necessary in this case."
