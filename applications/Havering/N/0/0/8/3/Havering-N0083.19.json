    "The proposed amendment to condition 6 of P1237.18 to replace the sedum green roof with artificial turf is considered to materially affect the character and nature of the development previously approved and cannot be regarded as a non-material amendment.",
    "The submission of an application under section 73 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 seeking a minor material amendment to vary or remove a condition of planning permission is therefore deemed necessary in this case.",
    "It is advised that the modification of condition 6 to replace the sedum green roof with artificial turf is not considered to achieve the objective of the condition. The condition was intended to maintain a landscaped and sustainable garden environment in lieu of the outbuilding which would not ordinarily be considered acceptable without the conditions imposed."
