    "The amendments from the previously approved scheme to increase the width of the front extension by 300mm to front bay window, addition of 2m deep rear extension and change roof from hipped to flat roof form are considered to materially affect the character and nature of the development and be contrary to condition No.3 of planning ref:P0954.21 dated 15/07/21 which is accordance with the approved plans.  The proposals represent a material change to the development previously approved, which requires planning permission in its own right.",
    "The alterations cannot therefore be regarded as a minor amendment in this instance, and the submission of a fresh planning application is therefore deemed necessary in this case."
