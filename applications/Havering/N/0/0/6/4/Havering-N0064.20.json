  "decision_conditions": [
    "The alteration from the previously approved scheme to increase depth of rear extension and straighten the right side wall of the rear extension would materially affect the character and scale of the development. As such, it is therefore considered to result in a material impact upon the amenities of the neighbouring occupiers. The amendment sought thus represents a material change to the development previously approved, which requires planning permission in its own right.",
    "The alteration cannot be regarded as a non-material amendment for the purposes of section 96A in this instance, and the submission of a fresh planning application is deemed necessary in this case."
