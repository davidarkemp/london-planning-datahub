    "The requested non-material amendment to planning permission P1236.22 dated 22-09-22 to allow for an additional window to the ground floor north side elevation cannot be considered as minor amendment due to condition no.5 (flank window) on the decision notice for P1236.22, which requires planning permission in its own right. This standard flank window condition requires a further planning application to alter or add windows or openings on the flank elevations of the extensions and therefore represents a material change to the previously approved scheme.",
    "The alteration cannot therefore be regarded as a minor amendment in this instance, and the submission of a fresh planning application is therefore deemed necessary in this case."
