  "decision_conditions": [
    "The alteration from the previously approved scheme to change the approved materials from tile hung dormers to composite weathering boarding (Hardie Plank or similar) and replacing the face brick on the gable walls to composite weathering boarding (Hardie Plank or similar) is contrary to conditions No.2 (matching materials) and No.3 (accordance with plans) of P1089.20 dated 30th September 2020.  The revision represents a material change to the previously approved scheme, which requires planning permission in its own right.",
    "The alterations cannot therefore be regarded as a minor amendment in this instance, and the submission of a fresh planning application is therefore deemed necessary in this case."
