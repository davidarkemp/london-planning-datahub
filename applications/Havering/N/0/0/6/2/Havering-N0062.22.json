(Single storey front/side/rear extension and conversion of roof space to habitable use to include a rear dormer) (Retrospective).",

    "The requested non-material amendment to planning permission ref: P1047.21 dated 02/07/21 to allow for retention of the change of materials used for the dormer is not non-material due to condition 3 which specifies the materials to be used. As such, a s73 would be required.",
    "The applicant is advised that should a s73 be submitted, such application will be assessed on its merit. However, due to the property on a prominent corner on the streetscene, the use of black cladding for the dormer would likely be detrimental to the visual amenity in the streetscene and out of character with its immediate surrounding."
