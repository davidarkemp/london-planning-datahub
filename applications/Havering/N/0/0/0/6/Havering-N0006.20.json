    "In reviewing the submitted plans it is clear that the non-material amendment would increase the floor space at roof level and the proposed side windows would not be obscured glazed. It is considered that both such amendments would require the formal consultation of neighbours. As such, the amendments sought are considered to materially affect the character and nature of the original development and therefore cannot be regarded as a non-material for the purposes of section 96A."
