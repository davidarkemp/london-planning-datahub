  "decision_conditions": [
    "The requested non-material amendment to planning permission P2239.21 dated 18-01-22 to allow for repositioning door from flank/side wall to front elevation, with window to replace cannot be undertaken due to condition no.5 (flank window) on the decision notice for P2239.21 which requires planning permission in its own right. This standard flank window condition requires a further planning application to alter the windows or openings on the flank elevation of the extension and therefore represents a material change to the previously approved scheme.",
    "The alteration cannot therefore be regarded as a minor amendment in this instance, and the submission of a fresh planning application is therefore deemed necessary in this case."
