    "Reason:",
    "The amendments sought are considered to materially affect the character and nature of the development previously approved and cannot be regarded as a non- material amendment.",
    "In reviewing the submitted plans it is clear that there is significant increase in the size of windows which are disproportionate and will harm the rhythm of the windows on the rear elevation.",
    "Furthermore, given the fact that the non-material amendment does not involve public consultation, the disproportionate addition to the size of the windows will disadvantage previous objectors to the previous application. In view of this the proposed deviations from the approved drawings are not considered to be non-material in nature.",
    "The submission of a fresh planning application is therefore deemed necessary in this case."
