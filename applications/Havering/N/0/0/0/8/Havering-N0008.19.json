    "The alteration from the previously approved hipped roof over the main dwelling house to a gabled roof and the alteration of the twin hipped roof over the first floor rear extension to a crown roof with a large dormer styled extension from the loft, is considered to materially affect the character and nature of the development and be contrary to condition No.4 of P1153.18 dated 17th October 2018 which is accordance of the approved plans.",
    "The alterations cannot therefore be regarded as a minor amendment in this instance, and the submission of a fresh planning application is therefore deemed necessary in this case."
