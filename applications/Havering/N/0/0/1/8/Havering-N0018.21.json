    "The extent of changes to the scheme would go beyond the scope of a non-material minor amendment. Reducing the size of the application site, reducing the amenity space for the proposed dwelling and altering the car parking provision and layout for the donor and proposed dwellings would materially change the consented scheme - P0798.19. There is a reasonable expectation that neighbouring properties and the Highway Authority would be consulted on such matters. As such the alterations shown cannot be considered as non-material and require a fresh application for planning permission or S73 application."
