    "The alteration from the previously approved scheme to add a front dormer window is considered to materially affect the character and nature of the development and be contrary to condition No.3 of P0857.19 dated 2nd September 2019 which is accordance with the approved plans.  The proposals represent a material change to the development previously approved, which requires planning permission in its own right.",
    "The alterations cannot therefore be regarded as a minor amendment in this instance, and the submission of a fresh planning application is therefore deemed necessary in this case."
