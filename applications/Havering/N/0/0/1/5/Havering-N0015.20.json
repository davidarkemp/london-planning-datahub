    "The amendments sought as shown on the submitted plans for this minor amendment are amalgamation of the previously approved schemes P0191.18 and P0196.18. The previously approved shop front as part P0196.18 is different and the use of the ground floor of P0196.18 and the three storey rear extension approved as part of P0191.18 is being converted from restaurant to office space including board room and meeting room. The changes proposed would require the submission of a fresh planning application and as such, cannot be regarded as a minor amendment given that the proposal relates to more than one planning application."
