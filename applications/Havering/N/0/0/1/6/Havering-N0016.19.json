    "The proposed amendments would lead to alterations to the originally approved building fenestrations for Block J by way of new materials, windows and door details, as well as amendments to the boundary treatments. Notably, that the previously approved front boundary wall would be replaced with railing. However the overall building and general detailed design would remain within the spirit of the original permission. In addition, the amendments would cause no harm to the highways infrastructure, streetscape or general neighbour amenity.",
    "In light of the above, the proposed amendments represent relatively minor alterations to the overall scheme and would not significantly impact the development at large. As such, the proposed amendment would not materially alter the previous approved scheme or contradict the policy framework. Therefore the proposed alterations to the original planning permission are considered non-material in nature and can be approved in accordance with section 96A of t",
