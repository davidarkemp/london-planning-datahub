    "The requested non-material amendment to planning permission P1550.19 dated 14/02/20 to reduce the set back of the first floor side extension from 1m to 0.5m represents a material change to the previously approved scheme, which requires planning permission in its own right.",
    "The alteration cannot therefore be regarded as a minor amendment in this instance, and the submission of a fresh planning application is therefore deemed necessary in this case."
