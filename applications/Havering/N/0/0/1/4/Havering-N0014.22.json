    "The requested non-material amendment to planning permission P1749.21 dated 02-11-22 to allow for the replacement of the approved first floor window on the south-west elevation of the subject dwelling with high level windows cannot be undertaken due to condition no.5 (flank window) on the decision notice for P1749.21 which requires planning permission in its own right. This standard flank window condition requires a further planning application to alter the windows or openings on the flank elevation of the extension and therefore represents a material change to the previously approved scheme. Furthermore condition no.4 requires first floor flank windows to be obscure glazed, which would not be the case for the proposed replacement high level windows.",
    "Therefore, the alterations proposed cannot be regarded as a minor amendment in this instance and the submission of a fresh planning application is therefore deemed necessary in this case."
