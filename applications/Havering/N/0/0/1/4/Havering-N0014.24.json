    "The changes to the plans, including the site layout, car parking provision,  access and egress arrangements, proposed vehicular access to Rainham Road and the changes to House 2 would go beyond the scope of a non-material minor amendment and would require separate planning consent. Furthermore, there is a reasonable expectation that the Highway Authority and neighbouring properties would be consulted on these matters, particularly as planning application P1824.18 was refused due to the layout and siting of the car parking spaces and the proposed vehicular access to Rainham Road, which would impede the safe passage of vehicles and pedestrians harmful to highway and pedestrian safety. As such the alterations shown cannot be considered as non-material and require separate planning consent.",
    "Condition 22 of planning application P1467.19 states that \"Notwithstanding the provisions of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended), no development shall take place under Class A, B, C, D and E unless permission under the provisions of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 has first been sought and obtained in writing from the Local Planning Authority\". As such the alterations shown cannot be considered as non-material and require separate planning consent."
