    "In reviewing the submitted plans it is clear that the non-material amendment would change the siting and location of the proposed building, increase the building footprint, increase the number and location of windows and amend a condition. As such, the amendments sought are considered to materially affect the character and nature of the original development and vary conditions of the original approval and therefore cannot be regarded as a non-material amendment for the purposes of section 96A."
