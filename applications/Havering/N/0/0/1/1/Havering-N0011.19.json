    "The permission hereby granted does not supersede the previously imposed conditions.",
    "The original application was to create additional office space and changing rooms on 8 Marsh Way with an application under reference P1107.16.",
    "The current amendment is in order to omit the changing room and staff area from the previously approved development. The proposal will have no impact on any other aspect of the scheme.",
    "In the light of the above the proposed omission of the changing room, staff and storage building from the scheme approved with  P1107.16 is not considered to significantly affect the development and therefore can be considered to be a non-material amendment."
