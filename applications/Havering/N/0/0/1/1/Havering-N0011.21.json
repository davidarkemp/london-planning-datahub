  "description": "Non-material amendment to planning permission P1371.17 dated 27/04/18 to amend approved fence arrangement around buildings and main entrance, relocate proposed car park entrance, increase no. of parking spaces and minor amendments to soft and hard landscape layout (Erection of a part two, part three storey 'Construction and Infrastructure Skills and Innovation Centre' (CISIC) with covered pedestrian link, external alterations to the existing building and alterations to the existing servicing arrangements and car parking provision along with associated landscaping and a cycle/ pedestrian path.)",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The extent of changes to the scheme would go beyond the scope of a non-material minor amendment and incorporate matters which require further consideration, for example the increased parking provision. Whilst to some extent some of the changes described would be minor, cumulatively however the changes to site layout, vehicle parking, boundary treatment and landscaping would materially change the consented scheme. There is a reasonable expectation that neighbouring properties would be consulted on such matters. As such the alterations shown as a whole cannot be considered as non-material and require a fresh application for planning permission (or S73 application)."
