    "The alteration cannot therefore be regarded as a minor amendment in this instance, and the submission of a fresh planning application is therefore deemed necessary in this case.",
    "The applicant should also note that further changes to the plans approved under P0864.18, most notably changes to fenestration, also appear to have taken place and which would appear to require permission."
