    "Reason:",
    "The amendments sought are considered to materially affect the character and nature of the development previously approved and cannot be regarded as a minor amendment.",
    "In reviewing the submitted plans it is clear that there is significant increase in the number of solid window panels which preset an entirely different rhythm to the approved fenestration pattern. Furthermore, it would appear that the surface area for solid panels has increased. Therefore, there is a  material difference between the rhythm and number of spandrel fenestration in comparison with the approved scheme. In view of this the proposed deviations from the approved drawings are not considered to be non-material in nature.",
    "The submission of a fresh planning application is therefore deemed necessary in this case."
