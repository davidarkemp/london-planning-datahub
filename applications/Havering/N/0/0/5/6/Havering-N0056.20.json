  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed alteration to the previously approved scheme results in a change to the roof form from a hipped roof to a gable roof that results in an increase to the bulk, mass and scale of the sides of the roof which represents a material amendment to the approved scheme. The proposal represents a material change on the side boundaries which is visible from neighbouring properties.",
    "The alterations cannot therefore be regarded as a minor amendment, and the submission of a fresh planning application is therefore necessary."
