    "The non material amendment hereby approved shall not be carried out otherwise than in complete accordance with the drawing numbers 02/06 and 02/08.",
    "Reason:-",
    "For the avoidance of doubt and to ensure that the development is carried out as approved.",
    "The proposed amendment for formation of a rooflight, on the roof-slope of the application building is considered to be non-material. The window in question would be fixed and non opening and hence it would not result in any additional overlooking. The proposed dormer window, by reason of its location, size and design would not have any impact upon the character and appearance of the building. Hence recommendation for approval.",
    "The applicant's attention is drawn in particular to conditions approved in respect of the planning permission (Ref; 1163.18)  Failure to comply with the conditions may well result in enforcement proceedings being taken. The permission hereby granted does not supersede the previously imposed conditions."
