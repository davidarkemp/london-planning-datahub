  "description": "Application for a non-material amendment to planning permission P0926.20 dated 28/08/2020 to change roof of proposed extension from pitched to flat with a roof lantern (single storey rear extension with pitched roof)",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The alteration from the previously approved scheme to change pitch roof of proposed extension to flat with a roof lantern would increase the bulk and mass of development by raising the eaves height of proposed extension to 4.27 metres from the sloping rear ground level. As such, the amendment sought is considered to result in materially impact upon the amenities of the adjoining occupiers. The proposal represent a material change to the development previously approved, which requires planning permission in its own right.",
    "The alteration cannot therefore be regarded as a non-material amendment for the purposes of section 96A in this instance, and the submission of a fresh planning application is deemed necessary in this case."
