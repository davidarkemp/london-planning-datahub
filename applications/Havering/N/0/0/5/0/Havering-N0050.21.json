    "The proposed amendments are not considered to be non-material under section 96A as the overall depth and bulk of the extensions would be increased in size and it would not be in accordance with Condition 2 of the planning permission P1627.20 to build in accordance with approved plans.",
    "Therefore the request for a non-material amendment to planning permission Ref: P1627.20 (single storey rear extension) dated 24-12-20 to allow for an increased depth and change of roof form cannot be regarded as a minor amendment, and the submission of a fresh planning application is therefore deemed necessary in this case."
