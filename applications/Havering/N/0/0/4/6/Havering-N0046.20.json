    "The proposals would through the formation of an enlarged window opening at first floor level deviate from the original design concept for the conversion of the subject building and in doing so potentially cause harm to the Metropolitan Green Belt for reasons outlined in the officer's report for submission P0639.19 where a comparable arrangement had been sought and was refused. As such and in view of the finely balanced nature of the permission subject to amendment currently, the alterations shown cannot be considered as a non-material and require a fresh application for planning permission."
