    "The requested non-material amendment to planning permission to planning permission ref: P0616.23 dated 29/06/2023 to allow for addition of one window to rear extension and reposition bi-folding door to middle, addition of 2 skylights to proposed roof, and addition of an obscure window to side wall cannot be undertaken due to condition no. 5 (flank window) on the decision notice for P0616.23 which requires planning permission in its own right. This standard flank window condition requires a further planning application to alter the windows or openings on the flank elevation of the extension and therefore represents a material change to the previously approved scheme. Furthermore, whilst the additional flank window is denoted on the plans as being obscure glazed it would not be possible to secure the obscure glazing of the window in perpetuity under this application.",
    "Therefore, the alterations proposed cannot be regarded as a minor amendment in this instance and the submission of a fres",
    "It should be noted that the 'existing' drawings submitted as part of this application do not reflect the development currently on site. Also, the materials of the extension in question shown on the submitted drawings do not reflect the materials that were approved as part of P0616.23."
