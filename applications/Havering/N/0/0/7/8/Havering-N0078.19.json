    "Reason:",
    "The amendments sought are considered to materially affect the character and nature of the development previously approved and cannot be regarded as a minor amendment.",
    "In reviewing the submitted plans it is clear that there is an increase in height and difference in roof profile which would be clearly visible from the street scene and surrounding rear gardens. Furthermore the site is location within a special character area. Therefore, there a  material difference from the scale and design in comparison with the approved scheme. In view of this the proposed deviations from the approved drawings are not considered to be non-material in nature.",
    "The submission of a fresh planning application is therefore deemed necessary in this case."
