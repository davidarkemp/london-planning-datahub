(Demolition of the existing porch for a new open porch structure, two storey side extension, single storey rear extension, new detached double garage replacing the existing garage, new boundary wall, move of access for new garage and ramp in rear plot. Hip to gable loft conversion with a rear dormer and Juliet balcony and three roof lights to front.)",
