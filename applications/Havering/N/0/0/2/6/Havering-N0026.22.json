Fenestration to be obscured glass and facing onto side passage between 138 and 136 Station Lane. Addition of a low level external riser cupboard to front facade to 138&140 Station Lane\n \n(Change of Use of ground floor from Use Class E(e) (Doctors Surgery) to Use Class C3 (Dwellings), single storey rear extension and conversion of roof space to habitable use to include front and rear dormers to facilitate the creation of 4 x 1-bed and 2 x 2-bed self-contained flats, with associated parking and amenity space, involving demolition of existing extensions and detached garage with external alterations, roof lights and boundary treatments)",

    "The addition of a ground floor flank bathroom window to Apartment 1.02 would go beyond the scope of a non-material minor amendment and would require the variation of condition 8 of P1211.21, which states that: \"Notwithstanding the provisions of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015, no window or other opening (other than those shown on the submitted and approved plan,) shall be formed in the flank wall(s) of the building(s) hereby permitted, unless specific permission under the provisions of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 has first been sought and obtained in writing from the Local Planning Authority. There is a reasonable expectation that neighbouring properties would be consulted on this matter. As such the alterations shown cannot be considered as non-material and require a S73 application."
