    "The alteration from the previously approved scheme to reposition the high level window from the rear elevation to the side of the proposed extension is contrary to condition No.5 of P0856.18 dated 9th November 2018, which is standard flank window condition.  The revision represents a material change to the previously approved scheme, which requires planning permission in its own right.",
    "The alterations cannot therefore be regarded as a minor amendment in this instance, and the submission of a fresh planning application is therefore deemed necessary in this case."
