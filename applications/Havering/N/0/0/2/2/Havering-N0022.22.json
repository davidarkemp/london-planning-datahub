    "The requested non-material amendment to planning permission P1624.21 dated 09-11-21 to allow for the a reduction in the Gross Internal Floor area from 216m2 to 200.26m2, reduction in the number of bifolds to the rear extension and reduction in the number of front and side roof lights and flank windows to elevations cannot be undertaken because the approved plans submitted as part of P1624.21 indicate that the subject property has a height of approximately 8.31m. Given that the plans submitted for this application indicate that the height would increase by approximately 700mm, the alterations proposed cannot be regarded as a minor amendment in this instance and the submission of a fresh planning application is therefore deemed necessary in this case."
