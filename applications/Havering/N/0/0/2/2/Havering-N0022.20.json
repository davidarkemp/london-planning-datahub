    "The amendments sought are considered to materially affect the character and nature of the development previously approved and cannot be regarded as a non material amendment.",
    "In reviewing the submitted plan it is clear that there is an increase in depth which would be clearly visible from the  surrounding rear gardens. The proposal would increase the scale, bulk and mass of the development permitted under application ref:P0616.17. Therefore, there is a material difference from the scale in comparison with the approved scheme. In view of this the proposed deviations from the approved drawings are not considered to be non-material in nature.",
    "The submission of a fresh planning application is therefore deemed necessary in this case."
