    "There is insufficient information regarding the impact of noise from neighbouring licensed premises, late night uses and plant from the commercial unit below the proposed residential units on the future occupiers of the flats. The applicant failed to demonstrate that noise from late night opening uses and plant from the commercial unit is likely to significantly affect the amenity of future occupiers of the flats and whether the impacts on the proposed flats within the subject building would be capable of being mitigated to the satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority and as required by MA.2. (2)(d). Consequently, under the provisions of Schedule 2, Part 3, Class MA of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2021 (as amended), the prior approval of the Local Planning Authority is refused.",
    "In the absence of information about the walls (they could be half height but there is no indication), there are no windows, and therefore no natural light, to the bedroom of Flats 1B and 2B on the first and second floors respectively. In addition, there are no windows  and therefore, no natural light to the kitchen of Flats 1D and 1E on the first floor and 2D and 2E on the second floor of the building. Therefore, there is no natural light to the above habitable rooms of Flats 1B, 2B, 1D, 1E, 2D and 2E, which would result in poor living conditions and amenity for future occupants.  Consequently, under the provisions of Schedule 2, Part 3, Class MA of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2021 (as amended), the prior approval of the Local Planning Authority is refused."
