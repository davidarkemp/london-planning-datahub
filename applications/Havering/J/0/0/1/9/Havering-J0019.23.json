    "The proposal fails to meet the criteria set in paragraph MA.2. (a) under Class MA of Part 3 to Schedule 2 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 as amended, with respect to transport impacts of the development.There is insufficient and unsatisfactory information with respect to the refuse and recycle collection, including lack of cycle storage.",
    "Given the location of the site, a car free scheme could be acceptable, however, there is no legal undertaking for future occupiers of the site to be excluded from applying for over-subscribed residential parking zone. In the absence of legal agreement to exempt the future occupiers of the site from residential parking zone and together with the lack of relevant information, it is considered that the proposal would have an adverse impact upon the free flow of traffic and the safety of highway condition, hence prior approval is refused.",
    "The proposed studio flats has a gross internal floor space of 37sq.m and 38sq.m, which would not meet the minimum standard of 39sq.m for a studio with bathroom and therefore fails to comply with the DCLG Technical Space Standards. Consequently, under the provisions of Schedule 2, Part 3, Class MA of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development)(England) Order 2021 [as amended], the prior approval of the Local Planning Authority is refused."
