    "The creation of additional storeys to the existing modestly proportioned dwelling by reason of the resultant height, scale, bulk and mass would create a monolithic building which would be detrimental to the character and appearance of the site itself, as well as appearing incongruous and out of character in the wider streetscene. Consequently, under the provisions of Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development)(England) Order 2020 [as amended], the prior approval of the Local Planning Authority is refused.",
    "The proposed additional storeys over the existing building by reason of its excessive scale and massing and in proximity to the adjacent listed buildings, would be detrimental to the special interest of the listed building. It would conflict with the relationship of resulting building and would hinder appreciation of the significance of the designated heritage asset. It would therefore cause substantial harm to the significance of the designated heritage asset which would not be outweighed by any public benefits produced by the proposal. The proposal would therefore conflict with requirements of the NPPF and with Policy 28 of the Local Plan. Consequently, under the provisions of Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development)(England) Order 2020 [as amended], the prior approval of the Local Planning Authority is refused.",
    "The proposal fails to provide a mechanism to exclude the future occupiers of the site from obtaining parking permits within this residential controlled parking area which suffers from parking pressure and is already oversubscribed, resulting in adverse impact upon highways safety and the free flow of traffic.",
    "You are advised that in order to accommodate the proposed development within the boundary of the development site currently under construction, there would be a need for the amendment of the entire approved scheme. The assessment would not only be with respect to the impact of the development upon the highways condition, but also other aspects of the development including mix of dwellings, affordable housing and other considerations which would also entail the variation to the legal agreement."
