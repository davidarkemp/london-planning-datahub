    "The proposed development does not comply with the conditions as set out in section AA.2. (3) (a) (i), as the development, by reason of it's height and proximity to the adjoining neighbour, would result in significant and undue amenity impacts to the occupiers of no. 66 Herbert Road including a significant loss of access to sunlight/daylight for side facing habitable rooms, contrary to Class AA, Part 1 of Schedule 2 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) (Amendment) (No. 2) Order 2020. Therefore the consent for prior approval of the Local Planning Authority is refused."
