    "The proposal fails to constitute permitted development under Schedule 2, Part 3 Class MA of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) (Amendment) (No. 2) Order 2015 (as amended), because the scope of development proposed includes external staircase and new openings at the front of site which are not classified as permitted development, and hence prior approval is refused.",
    "The proposal fails to meet the criteria set in paragraph MA.2. (a) under Class MA of Part 3 to Schedule 2 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 as amended with respect to transport impacts of the development. The proposal is considered to make unsatisfactory arrangement and unclear access for cycle storage, and would be contrary to the provisions of Policy T5 the London Plan 2021."
