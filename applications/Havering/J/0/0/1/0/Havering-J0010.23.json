    "In the absence of evidence to clearly and robustly demonstrate that the building doesn't share a party wall with the neighbouring buildings, Archers Apartments, 27 Haysoms Close is not a purpose-built, detached block of flats, as it adjoins No.'s 25 & 26 Haysoms Close and Opera Restaurant Limited at 76-78 North Street. Consequently, under the provisions of Schedule 2, Part 20, Class A of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development)(England) Order 2021 [as amended], the prior approval of the Local Planning Authority is refused.",
    "The proposed development would, by reason of its excessive height, scale, bulk, mass and siting, appear incongruous, overbearing, dominant, visually intrusive and out of character in the streetscene and the surrounding area. Consequently, under the provisions of Schedule 2, Part 20, Class A of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development)(England) Order 2021 [as amended], the prior approval of the Local Planning Authority is refused.",
    "The proposed development would, by reason of its excessive height, scale, bulk, mass and siting, appear overbearing, dominant and visually intrusive harmful to the amenity of neighbouring properties, including loss of light and outlook. Consequently, under the provisions of Schedule 2, Part 20, Class A of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development)(England) Order 2021 [as amended], the prior approval of the Local Planning Authority is refused.",
    "In the absence of a legal agreement to prevent future occupants from applying for or obtaining a residents parking permit, the proposal fails to satisfactorily mitigate the parking impacts of the development. Consequently, under the provisions of Schedule 2, Part 20, Class A of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development)(England) Order 2021 [as amended], the prior approval of the Local Planning Authority is refused.",

This charge has been levied under s.206 of the Planning Act 2008 and includes both the Mayor of London's CIL and Havering Council's CIL.",
    "London Borough of Havering, as CIL collecting authority, has responsibility for the collection of the Mayoral CIL, in addition to Havering's CIL, on commencement of the development.",
    "Your proposal is subject to a CIL Liability Notice indicating a levy of £6,100 plus indexation for the application, based on the Mayoral CIL levy rate for Havering of £25/sq.m plus Havering's charging rate for residential of £125/sq.m (Zone A) and the floorspace of 244 square metres.",
