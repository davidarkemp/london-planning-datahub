    "Para W.(3)(b) allows the Local Planning Authority to refuse an application where in its opinion the developer has provided insufficient information to enable the authority to establish whether the proposed development complies with, any conditions except for G.1(d)(iv). The historic use of the site and accordingly the current lawful use is not clear and has not been satisfactorily demonstrated by the applicant. In the absence of any compelling case being made as to why the commercial unit would be regarded as Class E for the purposes of G(a) this represents an in principle conflict with Schedule 2, Part 3, Class G of The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended) and specifically G.(a).",
    "Having regard to G.(b) the unit presents to Rush Green Road with display windows. The use of the ground floor fronting the street for access as is proposed, would result in part of the building at ground floor being used as part of the flats. This would conflict with Schedule 2, Part 3, Class G of The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "Inadequate information has been provided in order to consider the impacts of the retained commercial use on future occupants in respect of noise generated. The development therefore conflicts with Schedule 2, Part 3, Class G of The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended) G.1(d)(iii)",
    "Indication is made by the applicant that waste would be stored to the rear of the property. It is unclear how this would be achieved, given that the units would not have access to the ground floor aside from the front entrance and the red-line plan is not suggestive of any land beyond the building. In any case, this would not align with the requirements for the Council to collect waste, which it has a statutory obligation to provide. There would be conflict with Schedule 2, Part 3, Class G of The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended) G.1(d)(v)",
    "The proposed layout plans and description of development provided indicate that the proposals would form a new entrance in the front of the building to serve the retained commercial use. Class G does not allow for any external works and the proposals therefore go beyond and do not comply with the scope of Schedule 2, Part 3, Class G of The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended)."
