    "The proposal would not comply with AD.2 (c), specifically in that it would include first floor flank windows in walls forming side elevations of the building. It would therefore not comply with the provisions of Schedule 2, Part 1, Class AD of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development)(England) Order 2020 [as amended].",
    "The creation of an additional storey to the existing detached dwelling would, by reason of its siting close to the eastern boundary of the site and degree of projection beyond the upper floor rear wall of the neighbouring dwelling to the east, and its resultant height, scale, bulk and mass appear overbearing, dominant, visually intrusive and would be harmful to the amenity of adjacent occupiers especially at no. 41 Richmond Road in terms of loss of light and overshadowing. Consequently, under the provisions of Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development)(England) Order 2020 [as amended], the prior approval of the Local Planning Authority is REFUSED.",
    "The applicant has not evidenced satisfactorily, due to insufficient information about the level of obscurity of the proposed first floor bathroom and kitchen windows, that the proposal would not result in overlooking or loss of privacy to the rear garden environments of neighbouring properties along Richmond Road. Consequently, under the provisions of Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development)(England) Order 2020 [as amended], the prior approval of the Local Planning Authority is REFUSED.",
    "The proposed development, by reason of its obscure glazed kitchen windows within the proposed first floor flat, would fail to provide adequate natural light in all the habitable rooms of the proposed dwellinghouse, resulting in substandard residential accommodation to the detriment of the amenity of the future occupants. Consequently, under the provisions of Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development)(England) Order 2020 [as amended], the prior approval of the Local Planning Authority is REFUSED."
