    "The proposed development does not comply with criteria (g) of Class AB.1, which states that \"the height of the highest part of the roof of the extended building would exceed by more than 3.5 metres the height of the highest part of the roof of every other building in the row of terrace buildings of which it forms part (not including plant, in each case).\" The overall height of the upwards extension is 3.787 metres above the existing roof and as such, the building will be more than 3.5m higher than the lowest part of the terrace of buildings in which it sits. Consequently, under the provisions of Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development)(England) Order 2020 [as amended], the prior approval of the Local Planning Authority is refused.",
    "The proposed development does not comply with condition 3 of Class AB, which states that \"Any development under Class AB is permitted subject to the condition that the development must not include a window in any wall or roof slope forming a side elevation of the building\". There are five proposed roof lights on the side elevation of the building (labelled as Elevation 2 Side on Drawing No. 20-081/10 Revision F), three of which would serve Studio 5 on the third floor and two of which would serve Studios 7 & 8 on the fourth floor. Consequently, under the provisions of Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development)(England) Order 2020 [as amended], the prior approval of the Local Planning Authority is refused.",
    "In the absence of a legal agreement to prevent future occupants from applying for or obtaining a residents parking permit, the proposal fails to satisfactorily mitigate the parking impacts of the development. Consequently, under the provisions of Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development)(England) Order 2020 [as amended], the prior approval of the Local Planning Authority is refused."
