    "The proposal fails to constitute permitted development under Part 20 Class AB(1) of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) (Amendment) (No. 2) Order 2020, because the scope of development proposed includes the redevelopment/alterations of existing first floor level and the replacement of the existing first floor rear railings which are not classified as permitted development, and hence prior approval is refused.",
    "The proposed development does not comply with criteria AB(3)(c) which requires the construction of appropriate and safe access to and egress from the new dwellinghouses and existing premises, including means of escape from fire, via additional external doors or external staircases. The proposals includes the provision of a full width walkway with screening. Consequently, under the provisions of Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development)(England) Order 2020 [as amended], the prior approval of the Local Planning Authority is refused.",
    "In the absence of a legal agreement to prevent future occupants from applying for or obtaining a residents parking permit, the proposal fails to satisfactorily mitigate the parking impacts of the development. Consequently, under the provisions of Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development)(England) Order 2020 [as amended], the prior approval of the Local Planning Authority is refused.",
    "The proposed development does not comply with criteria AB(2)(g) which requires the proposals not to impact on the amenity of existing building and neighbouring premises including overlooking, privacy and the loss of light. The proposals would result in the reduction of the living standard of the existing/proposed occupiers at first floor (Flat 1) in terms of loss of outlook and the reduction of the unit from a 2 bedroom dual aspect unit to a single aspect 1 bedroom flat. It fails to satify the condition of residential amenity impact on existing building and hence prior approval is refused.",
    "The proposal, if granted planning permission on appeal, would be liable for the Mayor of London and Havering Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). Based upon the information supplied with the application, the Mayoral CIL payable would be £5,825 based on the calculation of £25.00 per square metre and the Havering Community Infrastructure Levy (HCIL) would be a charge of £29,125 based on calculation of £125 per square metre. Each would be subject to indexation.",
    "Further details with regard to CIL are available from the Council's website."
