    "The proposal fails to constitute permitted development under Schedule 2, Part 3 Class MA of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) (Amendment) (No. 2) Order 2015 (as amended), because the scope of development proposed includes external door and windows on the western elevation of site which are not classified as permitted development, and hence prior approval is refused.",
    "The proposal fails to meet the criteria set in paragraph MA.2. (f) under Class MA of Part 3 to Schedule 2 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended) with respect to the provision of adequate natural light in all habitable rooms of the dwellinghouses and it is considered that the proposed development would result in poor living conditions and amenity for future occupants due to the insufficient provision of natural light to habitable rooms.",
    "The proposal fails to meet the criteria set in  paragraph MA.2. (a) under Class MA of Part 3 to Schedule 2 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 as amended, with respect to transport impacts of the development, particularly to ensure safe site access. Given the location of the site a car free scheme could be acceptable, however, there is no legal undertaking for future occupiers of the site to be excluded from applying for over-subscribed residential parking zone. In the absence of legal agreement to exempt the future occupiers of the site from residential parking zone, it is considered that the proposal would have an adverse impact upon the free flow of traffic and the safety of highway condition. In addition, it is unclear how refuse and cycle storage would be provided and the potential adverse implications this could have on the servicing of the site.",
    "The proposal fails to meet the criteria set in paragraph MA.2. (d) under Class MA of Part 3 to Schedule 2 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 as amended with respect potential noise impact upon the proposed flats from the existing commercial properties. In the absence of sufficient information it would be likely that the future occupiers of the site would suffer from undue noise from the potential associated town centre activities.",
    "The proposed ground floor front 1b2p and middle flat 1b2p flats would have inadequate gross internal floor space of 49.71sq.m and 39.35sq.m, which would not meet the required minimum standard of 50sq.m each and therefore fails to comply with the DCLG Technical Space Standards. Consequently, under the provisions of Schedule 2, Part 3, Class MA of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development)(England) Order 2021 [as amended], the prior approval of the Local Planning Authority is refused."
