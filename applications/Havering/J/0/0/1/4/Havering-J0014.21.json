    "The Council consider that the proposed development has not clearly identified or explained the servicing strategy for the proposed dwellings, there is no indication for cycle or waste storage arrangements within the identified red line area. Further the proposal would result in increased demand for car parking spaces, however, there is no indication as any mitigating measures (such as a completed legal agreement) to ensure there would be no overspill parking in nearby street already suffering from stressed parking. Consequently, under the provisions of Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 [as amended], the prior approval of the Local Planning Authority is refused.",
    "The Council consider that the proposed development would result in poor living conditions and amenity for future occupants due to the insufficient provision of natural light to habitable rooms. The submitted 'Daylight & Sunlight Assessment' references a different development of 4 flats with different layouts, and so cannot be considered as proper evidence for this application. Consequently, under the provisions of Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 [as amended], the prior approval of the Local Planning Authority is refused."
