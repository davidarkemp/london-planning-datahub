    "The creation of an additional storey to the existing detached bungalow would, by reason of its resultant height, bulk and mass, combined with its proximity to the boundaries of its site and overall depth, give rise to development that is  overbearing, dominant and visually intrusive in relation to both neighbouring properties at Christine Court and no.40. Wennington Road, and would thereby be harmful to the amenity of these immediate adjacent occupiers. Consequently, under the provisions of Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development)(England) Order 2020 [as amended], the prior approval of the Local Planning Authority is REFUSED."
