    "The Council consider that the proposed development would result in poor living conditions and amenity for future occupants due to the insufficient provision of natural light to habitable rooms. Consequently, under the provisions of Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 [as amended], the prior approval of the Local Planning Authority is refused",
    "Given the PTAL level of 2 of the application site, in the absence of a designated parking space for the proposed residential unit, the proposal fails to satisfactorily mitigate the parking impacts of the development, contrary to the provisions of Policy 24 of the Havering Local Plan (2016-2031) and Policy T6.1 of the London Plan. Consequently, under the provisions of Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 [as amended], the prior approval of the Local Planning Authority is refused",
    "The Council consider that the proposed development, by reason of its inadequate level of internal floorspace standard for the proposed studio flat, providing a constrained and sub-standard residential accommodation for future occupiers which would adversely impact on their living condition.

    "The development site is within Flood Zone 2 as defined by the Environment Agency, the proposal fail to provide a detailed plan of the proposed storm drainage system, SuDS & hydraulic design.

    "The proposed layout of the property indicates that bedrooms would be facing the main road (which is approximately 7.5m from the facade to the edge of the carriageway, and 15m to the centre line). The roposal fail to provide a noise report to assess the impact on the bedrooms, and any mitigation. Consequently, under the provisions of Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 [as amended], the prior approval of the Local Planning Authority is refused",
    "The proposed development woud be of poor design and appear incongurous and out of character for a residential unit within the area.
