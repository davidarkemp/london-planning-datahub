    "Whilst due to high accessibility, a car free scheme would be considered acceptable, there is no mechanism i.e. undertaking to prevent the future occupiers of the site from obtaining a residential parking permit in the nearby Residential Parking Zone which already suffers from parking stress. Consequently, the proposal would potentially have an adverse impact upon the free flow of traffic and the safety of the highways conditions.  The development therefore fails to adequately consider the provisions of Schedule 2, Part 3, Class MA of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended) and would conflict with MA.2(2)(a) and prior approval is refused.",
    "The submitted noise report does not adequately address noise concerns with respect to music from the Vertigo Club which is approximately 40m from the development. The aforementioned premises has a history of noise complaints and in view of this and the location of bedrooms at the front of the premises, will potentially adversely impact the living conditions of future residents.  In the absence of sufficient information it would be likely that the future occupiers of the site would suffer from undue noise from the potential associated town centre activities and the proposal fails to meet the criteria set in paragraph MA.2. (d) under Class MA of Part 3 to Schedule 2 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 as amended with respect potential noise impact upon the proposed flats from nearby commercial properties",
    "The proposal includes physical external alterations to the building, i.e. the repositioning of the entrance door at first floor level.  The external alteration proposed would not be considered to be permitted development under Class MA of the Schedule 2 to the Use Classes Order. A separate planning application would be required for the proposed physical alterations."
