    "The proposal fails to constitute permitted development under Schedule 2, Part 3 Class MA of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) (Amendment) (No. 2) Order 2015 (as amended), because the scope of development proposed includes external alterations of existing ground and first floor levels (insertions of doors, windows, pillars, railings and extension) which are not classified as permitted development, and hence prior approval is refused.",
    "The submitted daylight and sunlight report has demonstrated that the proposal would fail to provide adequate level of light to meet the criteria set in paragraph MA.2. (f) under Class MA of Part 3 to Schedule 2 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended) with respect to the provision of adequate natural light in all habitable rooms of the dwellinghouses (one bedroom in flat 1.01 and one bedroom in flat 1.04) and it is therefore considered that the proposed development would result in poor living conditions and amenity for future occupants due to the insufficient provision of natural light to habitable rooms.",
    "The proposal fails to meet the criteria set in paragraph MA.2. (a) under Class MA of Part 3 to Schedule 2 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 as amended, with respect to transport impacts of the development, particularly to ensure safe site access. There is insufficient information with respect to the refuse and recycle collection and clear access to the location of the cycle storage. In particular, there are concerns about the location and collection of the refuse bins in absence of a refuse strategy, which would therefore be considered to have a significant adverse impact on the highways network.",
    "Given the location of the site, a car free scheme could be acceptable; however, there is no legal undertaking for future occupiers of the site to be excluded from applying for over-subscribed residential parking zone. In the absence of legal agreement to exempt the future occupiers of the site from residential parking zone as insufficient t",
    "The proposal fails to meet the criteria set in paragraph MA.2. (d) under Class MA of Part 3 to Schedule 2 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 as amended with respect to potential noise impact upon the proposed flats from the commercial properties located in close vicinity of the site. In the absence of sufficient information regarding mitigation to address noise from the road network, as well as the Agent of Change principle it would be likely that the future occupiers of the site would suffer from undue noise from nearby commercial activities."
