    "Insufficient information has been provided to ensure that the proposed development would have an acceptable impact on highways. The proposal would result in an additional car parking space being provided at the rear of the site, however no information has been provided to demonstrate how many vehicles are parked at the rear of the site or if there is sufficient space for manoeuvrability for vehicles to enter and exit the site in forward gear. As it stands it appears that vehicles would be required to exit the site in reverse gear which would have an unacceptable impact on the functioning of Hornchurch road and would create a potential traffic hazard. In the absence of such information there would be a concern with impact of the proposed development upon the safe and free flow of traffic on Hornchurch Road.",
    "The Council consider that insufficient information has been provided to demonstrate how the noise impacts of the surrounding commercial premises will be mitigated to protect the acoustic amenity of future occupants of the development. In the absence of such information Council consider that the noise impacts of operations of the surrounding commercial premises may result in a poor level of amenity for  future occupants of the development."
