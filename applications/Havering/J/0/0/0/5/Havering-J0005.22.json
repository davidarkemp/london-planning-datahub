    "The proposed development does not comply with criteria 1(a) of Class AB, which states that \"up to two additional storeys, in the case of an existing building consisting of two or more storeys\". The first floor rear extension is not implimented and therefore, the proposal is for three (3) additional stories. Consequently, under the provisions of Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development)(England) Order 2020 [as amended], the prior approval of the Local Planning Authority is refused.",
    "The proposed development does not comply with criteria 1(h)(ii) of Class AB, which states \"the height of the highest part of the roof of the extended building would exceed the height of the highest part of the roof of the existing building (not including plant, in each case) by more than 7 metres. At one part the overall height would be 8.3m. Consequently, under the provisions of Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development)(England) Order 2020 [as amended], the prior approval of the Local Planning Authority is refused.",
    "The proposed development does not comply with criteria 1(d) of Class AB which states \"waste or other ancillary facilities reasonably necessary to support the new dwelling houses\". Due to the waste storage location and access and distance the refuse lorries would not access the refuse. It fails to satify the condition of waste factilites to support the new dwelling houses."
