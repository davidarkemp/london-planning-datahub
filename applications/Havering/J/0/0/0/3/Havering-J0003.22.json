    "The proposed development would, by reason of its additional height, scale, bulk and mass, appear dominant, visually intrusive, incongruous and out of character in the streetscene and in the surrounding area. Consequently, under the provisions of Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development)(England) Order 2020 [as amended], the prior approval of the Local Planning Authority is refused.",
    "Introducing such a high building in such close proximity to neighbouring dwellings and gardens in Medora Road that would fill their view, would provide a \"wall of development\" which will give rise to an uncomfortable overbearing effect and sense of enclosure that would be oppressive and result in a significant loss of amenity, including loss of outlook. The proposed development would result in a loss of amenity, including a loss of outlook to No.'s 1-12 Romside Place and 25-33 Romside Place. Consequently, under the provisions of Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development)(England) Order 2020 [as amended], the prior approval of the Local Planning Authority is refused.",
    "In the absence of a legal agreement to prevent future occupants from applying for or obtaining a residents parking permit, the proposal fails to satisfactorily mitigate the parking impacts of the development. Consequently, under the provisions of Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development)(England) Order 2020 [as amended], the prior approval of the Local Planning Authority is refused.",
