    "Prior Approval is required (given) in accordance with the details as provided within the application.",
    "Notwithstanding the details shown on the submitted plans, Planning Statement dated March 2024 Ref: P1116 and Design and Access Document (Design doc 23/234-6001-R02 March 2024) and prior to above ground works, a written specification of external walls and roof materials to be used in the construction of the building(s) shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority and thereafter the development shall be constructed with the approved materials.",
    "Reason: Insufficient information has been supplied with the application to judge the appropriateness of the materials to be used.  Submission of a written specification prior to above ground works will ensure that the appearance of the proposed development will harmonise with the character of the surrounding area.",
    "Notwithstanding the details on the approved plans and prior to the occupation of the development with respect to this prior approval, the details of the refuse and recycling storage as well as cycle storage shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority. The refuse and recycling facilities and cycle storage shall then be implemented in accordance to the approved details and shall be retained as such thereafter.",
    "Reason: Insufficient information has been supplied with the application to judge how refuse and recycling and cycle storage will be managed on site.  Submission of this detail prior to occupation in the case of new building works or prior to the use commencing in the case of changes of use will protect the amenity of occupiers of the development and also the locality generally.",
    "No works shall take place in relation to any of the development hereby approved until a scheme for the protection of preserved trees on the site has been submitted to and agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority. Such scheme shall contain details of the erection and maintenance of fences or walls around the trees, details of underground measures to protect roots, the control of areas around the trees and any other measures necessary for the protection of the trees. Such agreed measures shall be implemented before development commences and kept in place until the approved development is completed.",
    "Reason: Insufficient information has been supplied with the application to demonstrate how the preserved trees on site will be adequately protected during construction.  Submission of details prior to commencement will ensure that the measures to be employed are robust.",
    "Before the building(s) hereby permitted is first occupied, the area set aside for car parking shall be laid out in accordance with Drawing No. 003 Revision 02 and retained permanently thereafter, with four car parking spaces for the residents of the development and one car parking space for visitors and shall not be used for any other purpose.",
    "Reason: To ensure that car parking accommodation is made permanently available to the standards adopted by the Local Planning Authority in the interest of highway safety.",
    "All residential parking spaces within the development hereby approved shall include provision of infrastructure for electric or Ultra-Low Emission vehicles, of which a minimum of 2 spaces shall have active charging facilities, with passive provision for all remaining spaces. Such provision is to be made prior to the first occupation of the dwellings hereby permitted.",
    "Reason:  Provision prior to first occupation of the proposed dwellings hereby permitted will ensure that the development adequately incorporates measures to allow the use of electric vehicles by future occupiers in accordance with Policy T6.1 of the London Plan.",
    "Prior to the commencement of any development, an assessment shall be undertaken of the impact of noise emanating from Upminster Road upon the development.  Reference should be made to the \"good\" standard to be found in the World Health Organisation Guidelines for Community Noise 1999 and BS8233:2014 Guidance on Sound Insulation and Noise Reduction for Buildings.  Reference should also be made to the Acoustics Ventilation & Overheating Residential Design Guide 2020.  Following this, a scheme detailing measures, which are to protect occupants from transport noise shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority.  It shall be implemented and validated prior to occupation.",
    "Reason: Insufficient information has been supplied with the application to assess the impact of noise emanating from Upminster Road upon the development. Submission of this detail prior to commencement of any development will protect residents against the impact of noise emanating from Upm",
    "Before beginning the development, the developer must provide the Local Planning Authority with a report for the management of the construction of the development, which sets out the proposed development hours of operation and how any adverse impact of noise, dust, vibration and traffic on occupiers of the building and adjoining owners or occupiers will be mitigated to the satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason: Insufficient information has been supplied with the application in relation to the proposed construction methodology. Submission of details prior to commencement will ensure that the method of construction protects residential amenity.",
    "The proposed windows on the sides (West and East elevations) and rear (North elevation) of the stairwells to Units A-E as shown on Drawing No.'s 201 Revision 09, 221 Revision 03 and 222 Revision 03 shall be permanently glazed with obscure glass not less than level 4 on the standard scale of obscurity and shall thereafter be maintained.",
