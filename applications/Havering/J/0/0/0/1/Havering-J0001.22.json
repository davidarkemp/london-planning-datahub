  "description": "Addition of one storey to existing two storey terrace building to create an additional 2 x 1 & 3 x 2 bed flats (PRIOR APPROVAL) and cycle storage",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed development does not comply with criteria 9A(b) of Class AB, which states that \"Schedule 2 does not grant permission for, or authorise any development of, any new dwellinghouse that does not comply with the nationally described space standard issued by the Department for Communities and Local Government on 27th March 2015(1)\".",
    "The double bedroom of Flats F1 and F2 has a width of between 2.3 and 2.5 metres, which does not meet the width of 2.75 metres in line with the DCLG Technical  Space Standards. Consequently, under the provisions of Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development)(England) Order 2020 [as amended], the prior approval of the Local Planning Authority is refused.",
    "Given the existing narrow staicases, the proposed cycle storage and refuse facilities arrangement would be practically inaccessible at its current location with no servicing strategy proposed, which may impact upon highway safety and the free flow of traffic. Consequently, under the provisions of Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development)(England) Order 2020 [as amended], the prior approval of the Local Planning Authority is refused.",
    "In the absence of a legal agreement to prevent future occupants from applying for or obtaining a residents parking permit, the proposal fails to satisfactorily mitigate the parking impacts of the development. Consequently, under the provisions of Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development)(England) Order 2020 [as amended], the prior approval of the Local Planning Authority is refused.",
    "The proposal, if granted planning permission on appeal, would be liable for the Mayor of London and Havering Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). Based upon the information supplied with the application, the Mayoral CIL payable would be £5,825 based on the calculation of £25.00 per square metre and the Havering Community Infrastructure Levy (HCIL) would be a charge of £29,125 based on calculation of £125 per square metre. Each would be subject to indexation.",
    "Further details with regard to CIL are available from the Council's website."
