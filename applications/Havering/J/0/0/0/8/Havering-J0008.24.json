    "Historic maps held by the Council indicate that a building was in situ at the site in the location of the Bungalow prior to the 1st July 1948. The Council has no evidence that the building was constructed after 1st July 1948 (e.g. planning or building control records). The applicant has not demonstrated that the building was constructed after 1948 in order to satisfy AA.1(c). Consequently, under the provisions of Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development)(England) Order 2020 [as amended], the prior approval of the Local Planning Authority is REFUSED.",
    "Further to the above the applicant has provided a section drawing which demonstrates that the headroom of the additional storey proposed would exceed the lower of 3m and the height of floor to ceiling height, measured internally, of any storey of the principal part of the existing dwellinghouse (that shown to be 2.20m on plans submitted) with a stated height of 2.385m. Accordingly the proposals do not comply with the provisions of AA.1(h)(i)/(ii). Consequently, under the provisions of Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development)(England) Order 2020 [as amended], the prior approval of the Local Planning Authority is REFUSED.",
    "The applicant is advised that the red-line plan submitted should show all land required for access to the site from a public highway, car parking, gardens and other open land around buildings and that this should be outlined in red entirely."
