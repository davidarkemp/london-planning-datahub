(a) under Class MA of Part 3 to Schedule 2 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 as amended with respect to transport impacts of the development.  The proposal is considered to make inadequate provision for the collection of waste and refuse from the site, with no acceptable refuse strategy provided. Furthermore, the over-provision of car parking, in combination with the absence of any cycle parking provision, would fail to make adequate provision for sustainable travel and would be contrary to the provisions of Policies T5 and T6.1 of the London Plan.",

(d) under Class MA of Part 3 to Schedule 2 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 as amended with respect to potential noise impact upon the proposed flats from the commercial properties. Given the nature of the surrounding environment and, in particular the relationship of the site with the adjacent public house, in the absence of sufficient information it would be likely that the future occupiers of the site would suffer undue noise from the  associated commercial activities in close proximity of the site."
