  "description": "Prior Approval for construction of a two-storey addition to the top of an existing three-storey apartment building to create 4 x additional one-bedroom units.",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposal fails to constitute permitted development under Part 20 Class A of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) (Amendment) (No. 2) Order 2020, as the proposed ceiling heights exceed the height of a ceiling height of an existing floor in the building, which is classed as development not permitted, and hence prior approval is refused.",
    "The proposed extension would, by reason of its external appearance in terms of excessive height, scale, bulk and mass, appear incongruous on the host building and out of character with the prevailing scale and pattern of development of the surrounding built form. Consequently, under the provisions of Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development)(England) Order 2020 [as amended], the prior approval of the Local Planning Authority is refused.",
    "The proposed extension would, by reason of its excessive height, scale, bulk and mass, appear overbearing, dominant and visually intrusive to neighbouring properties on either side and result in adverse impacts on outlook and overshadowing which is harmful to the amenity of adjacent occupiers.Consequently, under the provisions of Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development)(England) Order 2020 [as amended], the prior approval of the Local Planning Authority is refused.",
    "The proposal would be CIL liable. The total floor space would be 200sqm. This would equate to £5000 mayoral CIL and £25000 Havering CIL",
    "You are advised to visit the planning portal website where you can download the appropriate document templates.",
