    "The applicant has not demonstrated that the proposals would comply with AA.1.(h)(i)/(ii), specifically that internal floor to ceiling height would not exceed the lower of 3 metres; or the floor to ceiling height, measured internally, of any storey of the principal part of the dwelling house. Consequently the proposals do not comply with the provisions of Schedule 2, Part 1, Class AA of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development)(England) Order 2020 [as amended].",
    "The creation of an additional storey to the existing modestly proportioned dwelling in the approach taken would by reason of the resultant height,  design, scale, bulk and mass be of an appearance detrimental to the character and appearance of the site, as well as appearing incongruous and out of character in the wider streetscene and surrounding vernacular, harmful to the character and appearance of the surrounding area. Consequently, under the provisions of Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development)(England) Order 2020 [as amended], the prior approval of the Local Planning Authority is REFUSED.",
    "The creation of an additional storey to the existing detached dwelling would, by reason of its siting, resultant height, scale, bulk and mass, appear overbearing, dominant, visually intrusive and would be harmful to the amenity of adjacent occupiers especially at no. 1 Linley Crescent in terms of loss of light and outlook. Consequently, under the provisions of Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development)(England) Order 2020 [as amended], the prior approval of the Local Planning Authority is REFUSED."
