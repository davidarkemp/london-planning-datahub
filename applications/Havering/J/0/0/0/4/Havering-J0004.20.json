    "Prior Approval under Class M, Part 3, Schedule of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended) is refused on the grounds that the proposed development would harm the sustainability, viability and vibrancy of the designated Minor Local Centre of which the site forms part.  Furthermore, no supporting information has been provided that there is no reasonable prospect that the premises could be used to provide a suitable service appropriate to a shopping parade. In this respect the proposal fails to satisfy Condition M.2.(1) (d) of the GPDO."
