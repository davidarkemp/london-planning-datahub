    "In the absence of a daylight and sunlight report to demonstrate otherwise, it is judged that the proposal would fail to meet the criteria set in paragraph MA.2. (f) under Class MA of Part 3 to Schedule 2 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended) with respect to the provision of adequate natural light in all habitable rooms of the dwellinghouses and it is considered that the proposed development would result in poor living conditions and amenity for future occupants due to the insufficient provision of natural light to habitable rooms.",
    "The proposal fails to meet the criteria set in  paragraph MA.2. (a) under Class MA of Part 3 to Schedule 2 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 as amended, with respect to transport impacts of the development, particularly to ensure safe site access. There is insufficient information with respect to the refuse and recycle collection. In particular, the collection point is not within the redline area of the site and can not be controlled via condition, therefore, the proposed location in addition with the existing commercial bins would be considered to have significant adverse impact on the highways network.",
    "There is insufficient information with respect to the car parking space and cycle storage provision to comply with the London Plan policies T5 and T6, the location indicated for these facilities would be outside the red line area of the site and would therefore be unacceptable.",
    "The proposal fails to meet the criteria set in paragraph MA.2. (d) under Class MA of Part 3 to Schedule 2 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 as amended with respect potential noise impact upon the proposed flats from the commercial properties located in close vicinity of the site. In the absence of sufficient information it would be likely that the future occupiers of the site would suffer from undue noise from the potential associated town centre activities.",
    "The annotation on plan no. 199, 201 FP 02 Rev 11.08.23, states that flats 199b and 201b are required to be lawful. Please note that these first floor flats does not form part of the consideration under this application."
