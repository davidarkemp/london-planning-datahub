Any works which form part of the scheme shall be completed before any of the permitted dwellings is occupied. Reference should be made to the good standard to be found in the World Health Organisation Document number 12 relating to community noise and BS8233:2014. Following this, a scheme detailing measures, which are to protect occupants from transportation noise shall be submitted to, and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority and shall be implemented prior to occupation.",

    "None of the residential units hereby permitted shall be occupied until a scheme for the storage of refuse and recycling  have been submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority. The approved scheme shall then be implemented prior to the first occupation of any part of the development and retained as such thereafter.",
