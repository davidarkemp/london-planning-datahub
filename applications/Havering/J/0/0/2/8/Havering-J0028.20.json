    "The proposed development fails to comply with the relevant Schedule, Part and Class of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development)(England) Order 2015 [as amended], and under the provisions of Schedule 2, Part 3, Paragraph W of the same Order, prior approval of the Local Planning Authority is refused.",
    "The proposal would, by reason of noise and disturbance caused by customers entering and leaving the premises, vehicles parking and manoeuvring, particularly during the earlier hours of operation, be unacceptably detrimental to the amenities of occupiers of adjacent properties. Furthermore, any adequately worded condition would place unreasonable restrictions on the use and operation of the proposed use. Consequently, under the provisions of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development)(England) Order 2015 [as amended], and under the provisions of Schedule 2, Part 3, Class C.2(1) and Paragraph W of the same Schedule and Part of the same Order, prior approval of the Local Planning Authority is refused.",
    "The requirements of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development)(England) Order 2015 [as amended] do not require officers to seek any alterations to the submitted details. However, upon assessment of the scheme, the impact of the proposals and inherent concerns could not be readily overcome (if at all), and it is considered necessary to issue a decision as opposed to seek amendments and extend the deadline of the application under Article 7."
