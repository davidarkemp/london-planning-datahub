  "decision_conditions": [
    "The creation of an additional storey to the existing modestly proportioned dwelling in the design approach taken  would by reason of the resultant height, scale, bulk and mass be of an appearance detrimental to the character and appearance of the site itself, as well as appearing incongruous and out of character in the wider streetscene and surrounding vernacular harmful to the character and appearance of the surrounding area. Consequently, under the provisions of Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development)(England) Order 2020 [as amended], the prior approval of the Local Planning Authority is REFUSED.",
    "The creation of an additional storey to the existing detached dwelling would, by reason of its height, scale, bulk and mass, appear overbearing, dominant, visually intrusive and would be harmful to the amenity of adjacent occupiers.Consequently, under the provisions of Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development)(England) Order 2020 [as amended], the prior approval of the Local Planning Authority is refused.",
    "The proposal fails to constitute permitted development under Schedule 2, Part 1, Class AA (b) and AA.1 (i) of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) (Amendment) (No. 2) Order 2020, because the scope of development proposed includes building over the existing single storey rear extension, therefore the additional storey which is not on the topmost storey of the dwellinghouse and would be constructed other than on the principal part of the dwellinghouse, which is not classified as permitted development, and hence prior approval is refused.",
    "The proposed development does not comply with criteria AA.2. (1)(c) which requires the roof pitch of the principal part of the dwellinghouse following the development to be the same as the roof pitch of the existing dwellinghouse. The proposals would change the original pitch roof design to a crown roof. Consequently, under the provisions of Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development)(England) Order 2020 [as amended], the prior approval of the Local Planning Authority is refused."
