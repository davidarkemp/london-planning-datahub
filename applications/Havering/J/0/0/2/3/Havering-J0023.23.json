    "From review of the drawings submitted the floor area of the proposed building would exceed that of the existing and accordingly, in the absence of any evidence otherwise it is more than likely that the footprint of the new building falls outside the footprint of the old building. Consequently, under the provisions of Schedule 2, Part 20, Class ZA of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended) there would be conflict with ZA.1(h)",
    "The Council consider that the proposed development would be of an unsuitable design which would be at odds with prevailing patterns of development and would be wholly removed from its former use visually to the detriment of local character. This would be exacerbated by the design approach and landscaping shown. Furthermore the building would read as a prominent and intrusive feature from the public realm and adjoining sites. Consequently, under the provisions of Schedule 2, Part 20, Class ZA of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended), the prior approval of the Local Planning Authority is refused (conflict with ZA.2(1)(2) d, e, g and l).",
    "Due to the close proximity of the railway line, there is concern over the impacts of noise and vibration on future occupants of the proposed dwelling. No report has been submitted which evidences that the dwelling would be adequately protected from adverse impacts. Based on the lack of available information over the noise/vibration created by the Railway Line and its operation, whether any methods of mitigation would be suitable to ensure adequate sleeping and resting conditions within the property is unclear. Consequently, under the provisions of Schedule 2, Part 20, Class ZA of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended), the prior approval of the Local Planning Authority is refused (conflict with ZA.2(1)(2) d and h).",
    "There is conflict with the Interpretation of Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended) specifically at para (3)(1)(9A)(b) as the proposals would result in a dwelling which would not comply with the prescribed internal spacing standards through a combination of gross internal floor area and bedroom size and accordingly prior approval is refused.",
    "Drawing no. PL03 Rev F indicates that a number of existing parking spaces (four) would be removed from the site  effectively reducing the amount of parking for the main building. This would lead to increased compeition for limited on-street parking bays in Hornminster Glen and would displace any existing or future need to the public highway to the detriment of the amenity of surrounding neighbouring occupiers. The development therefore fails to adequately consider the provisions of Schedule 2, Part 20, Class ZA of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended) and would conflict with ZA.2(1)(2) and prior approval is refused."
