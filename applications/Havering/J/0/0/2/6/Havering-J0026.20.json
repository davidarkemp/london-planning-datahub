    "The proposed development would fail to provide adequately designed off-street parking, and would not provide any adequately designed cycle storage. Furthermore, the proposals would have an unacceptable impact on parking, the safe operation of the bus stop, and highway safety. The development would be unacceptable when assessed against the National Planning Policy Framework 2019 [as amended], policies 6.13 and 6.9 of the London Plan MALP 2016, and policies DC33, DC35 of the Havering Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD 2008. Consequently, under the provisions of Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development)(England) Order 2015 [as amended], the prior approval of the Local Planning Authority is refused.",
    "The proposed development would result in the loss of a service / commercial use within an identified Minor Local Centre, and there is insufficient information provided to prove that the loss of the service / commercial use would be acceptable, or that the use of the property as a service / commercial use would be unviable. As such the loss of the existing service / commercial use would be undesirable when considered against the National Planning Policy Framework 2019 [as amended], policy DC16 of the Havering Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD 2008. Consequently, under the provisions of Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development)(England) Order 2015 [as amended], the prior approval of the Local Planning Authority is refused.",
    "The proposed development would fail to provide an adequate amount of natural light to all habitable rooms of the proposed residential unit, and result in a sub-standard quality of accommodation for future occupants. The development would be unacceptable when assessed against the National Planning Policy Framework 2019 [as amended], policy 3.5 of the London Plan MALP 2016, and policies DC03, DC04 and DC61 of the Havering Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD 2008. Consequently, under the provisions of Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development)(England) Order 2015 [as amended], the prior approval of the Local Planning Authority is refused.",
    "The requirements of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development)(England) Order 2015 [as amended] do not require officers to seek any alterations to the submitted details. However, upon assessment of the scheme, the impact of the proposals and inherent concerns could not be readily overcome (if at all), and it is considered necessary to issue a decision as opposed to seek amendments and extend the deadline of the application under Article 7."
