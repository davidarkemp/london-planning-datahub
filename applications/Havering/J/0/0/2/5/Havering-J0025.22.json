    "The Council consider that the proposed development would fail to fully consider the highways impacts associated with the development as is required by  MA.2.(1)(2)(a). No indication has been given in plan form over off-street parking to serve the proposed units. Furthermore a condition to secure a restriction on future occupiers obtaining parking permits would not be appropriate and an agreement is required. Consequently, under the provisions of Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 [as amended], the prior approval of the Local Planning Authority is refused"
