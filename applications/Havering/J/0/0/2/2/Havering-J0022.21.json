    "The layout of the development is inadequate, as one double bedroom for each of the two bedroom, four person flats has an area of 10m², which does not meet the 11.5m² in line with the DCLG Technical Housing Standards.Therefore, the proposed layout of the development would be inadequate resulting in substandard accommodation for future residents through lack of internal space. Consequently, under the provisions of Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development)(England) Order 2020 [as amended], the prior approval of the Local Planning Authority is refused.",
    "In the absence of a detailed Daylight and Sunlight Assessment, the large areas of the habitable rooms of the proposed flats would not receive adequate daylight and sunlight. Consequently, under the provisions of Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development)(England) Order 2020 [as amended], the prior approval of the Local Planning Authority is refused.",
    "The proposed development is of a poor design and the addition of two storeys would give rise to a top heavy appearance, which would be unacceptable. In addition, the proposed development would, by reason of its excessive height, scale, bulk and mass, appear dominant, visually intrusive, incongruous and out of character in the streetscene and in the surrounding area. Consequently, under the provisions of Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development)(England) Order 2020 [as amended], the prior approval of the Local Planning Authority is refused.",
    "Introducing such a high building in such close proximity to neighbouring dwellings and gardens in Medora Road that would fill their view, would provide a \"wall of development\" which will give rise to an uncomfortable overbearing effect and sense of enclosure that would be oppressive and result in a significant loss of amenity, including loss of outlook. The proposed development would result in a loss of amenity, including a loss of outlook to No.'s 1-12 Romside Place and 25-33 Romside Place. Consequently, under the provisions of Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development)(England) Order 2020 [as amended], the prior approval of the Local Planning Authority is refused.",
    "In the absence of a legal agreement to prevent future occupants from applying for or obtaining a residents parking permit, the proposal fails to satisfactorily mitigate the parking impacts of the development. Consequently, under the provisions of Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development)(England) Order 2020 [as amended], the prior approval of the Local Planning Authority is refused.",
