    "The proposal would not constitute permitted development in respect of  Paragraph X, Class Q(a) of the GPDO 2015, as the area of land (outlined in red on Drawing No. SHF.02) would be three times larger than the land occupied by the agricultural building and would not be classified as curtilage to the agricultural building. Therefore, it is considered that under Paragraph X, Class Q (a), Part 3 of Schedule 2 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended) (or any Order revoking and/or re-enacting that Order) that Prior Approval should be refused.",
    "The submitted Flood Risk Assessment for South Hall Farm, Version 1.0 - Date 10/06/2019 has failed to demonstrate how the proposed development and the site users will be kept safe for the lifetime of the development as there is no adequate assessment of the risk of tidal flooding, which includes the risk of breach in the Thames tidal flood defences. The Flood Risk Assessment does not therefore provide a suitable basis for assessment to be made of the tidal flood risks impacting on the proposed development, which does not comply with paragraph 160 of the National Planning Policy Framework and is contrary to the provisions of Policy DC48 of the Local Development Framework Core Strategy and Development Plan Document.Therefore it is considered under Class Q.2 (1) (d) , Part 3 of Schedule 2 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development)(England) Order 2015 (or any Order revoking and/or re-enacting that Order) that Prior Approval should be refused.",
    "The submitted Flood Risk Assessment for South Hall Farm, Version 1.0 - Date 10/06/2019  does not adequately assess the development's flood risks and has failed to demonstrate that the development is 'safe' for its lifetime because there is no assessment of the impact of climate change using appropriate climate change allowances, which does not comply with paragraphs 30 to 32 of the  Flood Risk and Coastal Change section of the Planning Practice Guidance, the National Planning Policy Framework and is contrary to the provisions of Policy DC48 of the Local Development Framework Core Strategy and Development Plan Document.Therefore it is considered under Class Q.2 (1) (d) , Part 3 of Schedule 2 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development)(England) Order 2015 (or any Order revoking and/or re-enacting that Order) that Prior Approval should be refused."
