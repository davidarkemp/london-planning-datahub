    "The proposed development would, by reason of its excessive height, scale, bulk and mass, appear overbearing, dominant, visually intrusive and out of character in the streetscene and the surrounding area. Consequently, under the provisions of Schedule 2, Part 20, Class AA of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development)(England) Order 2021 [as amended], the prior approval of the Local Planning Authority is refused.",
    "The proposed development would be 7 storeys in height and no fire statement was submitted with the application. Consequently, under the provisions of Schedule 2, Part 20, Class AA of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development)(England) Order 2021 [as amended], the prior approval of the Local Planning Authority is refused.",
    "The proposal, if granted planning permission on appeal, would be liable for the Mayor of London and Havering Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). Based upon the information supplied with the application, the Mayoral CIL payable would be £14,765 based on the calculation of £25.00 per square metre and the Havering Community Infrastructure Levy (HCIL) would be a charge of £73,825 based on calculation of £125 per square metre. Each would be subject to indexation.",
