    "The proposed first and second floor units (01 and 02) at 1b2p each would have inadequate gross internal floor space of 49.47sq.m each, would not meet the required minimum standard of 50sq.m each and therefore fails to comply with the DCLG Technical Space Standards. Consequently, under the provisions of Schedule 2, Part 3, Class MA of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development)(England) Order 2021 [as amended], the prior approval of the Local Planning Authority is refused.",
    "The proposal fails to constitute permitted development under Schedule 2, Part 3 Class MA of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) (Amendment) (No. 2) Order 2015 (as amended), because the scope of development proposed includes external rooflights on the eastern and western elevations of site which are not classified as permitted development, and hence prior approval is refused.",
    "The proposal fails to meet the criteria set in  paragraph MA.2. (a) under Class MA of Part 3 to Schedule 2 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 as amended, with respect to transport impacts of the development, particularly to ensure safe site access. Given the location of the site a car free scheme could be acceptable, however, there is no legal undertaking for future occupiers of the site to be excluded from applying for over-subscribed residential parking zone. In the absence of legal agreement to exempt the future occupiers of the site from residential parking zone, it is considered that the proposal would have an adverse impact upon the free flow of traffic and the safety of highway condition. In addition, it is unclear how recycling storage facility would be provided and the potential adverse implications this could have on the servicing of the site.",
    "The proposal fails to meet the criteria set in paragraph MA.2. (d) under Class MA of Part 3 to Schedule 2 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 as amended with respect potential noise impact upon the proposed flats from the existing commercial properties on site and in close proximity of site. In the absence of sufficient information it would be likely that the future occupiers of the site would suffer from undue noise from the ground floor Adult Gaming Centre and other commercial activities in close vicinity."
