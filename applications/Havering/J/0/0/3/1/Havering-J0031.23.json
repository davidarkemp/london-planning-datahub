    "The proposal fails to meet the criteria set in paragraph MA.2. (a) under Class MA of Part 3 to Schedule 2 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 as amended with respect to transport impacts of the development. The proposal is considered to make inadequate provision for the storage of waste and refuse from the site, with no acceptable refuse storage location provided, and would be contrary to the provisions of Policy 35 the London Plan 2021.",
    "The proposal fails to meet the criteria set in paragraph MA.2. (d) under Class MA of Part 3 to Schedule 2 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 as amended with respect to potential noise impact upon the proposed flats from the commercial properties. Given the nature of the surrounding environment and, in particular the relationship of the site with the adjacent public house, in the absence of sufficient information it would be likely that the future occupiers of the site would suffer undue noise from the  associated commercial activities in close proximity of the site.",
    "In the absence of a daylight and sunlight report to demonstrate otherwise, it is judged that the proposal would fail to meet the criteria set in paragraph MA.2. (f) under Class MA of Part 3 to Schedule 2 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended) with respect to the provision of adequate natural light in all habitable rooms of ground floor flat A and it is considered that the proposed development would result in poor living conditions and amenity for future occupants due to the insufficient provision of natural light to habitable rooms, therefore the prior approval of the Local Planning Authority is refused."
