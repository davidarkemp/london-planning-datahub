In accordance with paragraph W of Part 3 of Schedule 2 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 2015, the local planning authority considers that prior approval should not be given.",
    "The Council consider that the proposed development would result in poor living conditions and amenity for future occupants due to the insufficient provision of natural light to all habitable rooms. Consequently, under the provisions of Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development)(England) Order 2015 [as amended], the prior approval of the Local Planning Authority is refused."
