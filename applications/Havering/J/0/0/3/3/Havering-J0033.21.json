    "The proposed development does not comply with the provisions of Class A as there is a conflict with A1(e)(ii). Drawings provided are indicative of a floor to ceiling height greater than that within the existing building.",
    "It is considered that the layout of the development is inadequate due to deficits in internal spacing and bedroom size/mix. The standards are minimum requirements and the failure to align with those minimum requirements is regarded as a significant failing (Block A, Flat 8 and Block B Flat 6 - 1B2P occupancy requires 50sqm minimum GIA). Therefore, the proposed layout of the development would be inadequate through not providing suffiicent internal spacing for all future residents. Furthermore the proposal does not appear to include a lift. It would be unacceptable for a building of up to 5 storeys not to include disabled access. Consequently, under the provisions of Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development)(England) Order 2020 [as amended], the prior approval of the Local Planning Authority is refused.",
    "In the absence of a legal agreement to prevent future occupants from applying for or obtaining a residents parking permit, the proposal fails to satisfactorily mitigate the parking impacts of the development. Consequently, under the provisions of Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development)(England) Order 2020 [as amended], the prior approval of the Local Planning Authority is refused.",
    "The bulk, scale and mass of the proposal in the case of each block would be out of context with the suburban character of the surrounding area. The proposal would sit  uncomfortably with surrounding buildings that are predominantly two storey and it is considered that the proposed development would, by reason of its excessive height, scale, bulk and mass, appear dominant, visually intrusive, incongruous and out of character in the streetscene and the surrounding area. This would be exacerbated by the top heavy nature of the development and materiality. Consequently, under the provisions of Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development)(England) Order 2020 [as amended], the prior approval of the Local Planning Authority is refused.",
    "The constrained nature of the site means that neighbouring dwellings are in close proximity to the boundary. This would have an overbearing impact on neighbouring dwellings and is likely to lead to overshadowing and overlooking issues which have not been suitably considered by the applicant and which would be detrimental to neighbouring amenity. Furthermore the provision of such height in this location, with regards to the Sunnydene Close street-scene would fill their view, would provide a \"wall of development\" which will give rise to an uncomfortable overbearing effect from premises immediately adjacent (fronting Gubbins Lane/north side of Sunnydene Close) and sense of enclosure that would be oppressive and result in a significant loss of amenity.. Consequently, under the provisions of Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development)(England) Order 2020 [as amended], the prior approval of the Local Planning Authority is refused.",
