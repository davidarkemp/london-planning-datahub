The applicant has not demonstrated that the existing and proposed flats within the subject building would be capable of being mitigated to the satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority and as required by A.2.- (1)(g). The application therefore fails to comply with the provisions of Schedule 2, Part 20, Class A of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015.",
