    "The proposal fails to constitute permitted development under Schedule 2, Part 3 Class MA of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) (Amendment) (No. 2) Order 2015 (as amended), because the scope of development proposed includes alterations to the shop front to create separate entrances for the commercial and residential uses on the west elevation of the site, which are not classified as permitted development, and hence prior approval is refused.",
    "It is unclear how refuse and cycle storage would be provided and the potential adverse implications this could have on the servicing of the site. Therefore, the proposed development would not provide adequate servicing arrangements and cycle storage for the proposed dwelling. Consequently, under the provisions of Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 [as amended], the prior approval of the Local Planning Authority is refused.",
    "The applicant may wish to give consideration to submitting an assessment regarding the impact of noise emanating from neighbouring commercial properties and the local road network upon the development for any future Prior Approval application, so this can be considered as part of an application."
