    "Given the relatively low accessibility of the site, the creation of a four bedroom, six person flat with no car parking provision would lead to increased competition for limited on-street parking bays in Helen Road and would displace any future need to the public highway to the detriment of the amenity of surrounding neighbouring occupiers. The development therefore fails to adequately consider the provisions of Schedule 2, Part 3, Class MA of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended) and would conflict with MA.2(2)(a) and prior approval is refused.",
    "The proposal fails to constitute permitted development under Schedule 2, Part 3 Class MA of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) (Amendment) (No. 2) Order 2015 (as amended), because the scope of development proposed includes repositioning a pair of doors on the north elevation of the site, which is not classified as permitted development, and hence prior approval is refused."
