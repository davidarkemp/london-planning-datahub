    "Class MA is comprised of Development consisting of a change of use of a building and any land within its curtilage from a use falling within Class E (commercial, business and service) of Schedule 2 to the Use Classes Order to a use falling within Class C3 (dwellinghouses) of Schedule 1 to that Order. The applicant has not demonstrated that the lawful use of the building is Class E and there is accordingly conflict with MA.1.- (1)(b). Planning history for the site is suggestive of the building forming a mixed use of B1/B8 with ancillary retail function.",
    "The Council's Public Protection team have objected on the basis of retained/surrounding commercial noise on the amenity of future occupants of the development. The applicant has not demonstrated that the activities taking place within the subject building and surrounding environment would be capable of being mitigated to the satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority and as required by MA.2.- (1)(2)(d). The application therefore fails to comply with the provisions of Schedule 2, Part 3, Class MA of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015.",
    "Through the absence of a section drawing the applicant has not demonstrated that the proposed units would provide sufficient headroom compliant with the nationally described space standard issued by the Department for Communities and Local Government on 27th March 2015. There would be conflict then with MA 9(A)(b). In the absence of any evidence otherwise the proposals fail to align fully with the provisions of Schedule 2, Part 3, Class MA of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015."
