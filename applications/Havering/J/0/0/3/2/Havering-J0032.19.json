    "The applicant has provided a transport statement which suggest the applicant would be willing to sign a unilateral agreement to prevent the future occupiers of the site to apply for residential parking permit with the nearly controlled parking zone which already suffer from severe parking stress. The proposal would result in increased demand for car parking spaces, however, there is no indication as any mitigating measures (such as a completed legal agreement) to ensure there would be no overspill parking in nearby street already suffering from stressed parking."
