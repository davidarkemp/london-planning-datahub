    "According to the Council's Building Control records, the application dwelling is one of a number of bungalows which was submitted to the Council is July 1899. There is no evidence to the contrary that the dwelling was constructed after 1st July 1948. As such, in the instance of no evidence to the contrary, it is considered that the proposed development would fail to comply with provisions of Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development)(England) Order 2020 [as amended].",
    "The enlargement of the existing two storey detached dwelling would, by reason of its height, scale, bulk and mass, appear overbearing, dominant and visually intrusive in the rear garden environment harmful to the amenity of adjacent occupiers at No.11 Curtis Road, Hornchurch. Consequently, under the provisions of Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development)(England) Order 2020 [as amended], the prior approval of the Local Planning Authority is refused.",
    "The enlargement of the existing two storey detached dwelling would, by reason of its scale, bulk and mass, appear incongruous and be out of character in the street scene as the new two storey dwelling would not follow the pattern of development where the neighbouring properties on either side are chalet styled bungalows. Consequently, under the provisions of Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development)(England) Order 2020 [as amended], the prior approval of the Local Planning Authority is refused.",
    "The applicant is advised should they have information to the contrary in respect to the construction date of dwelling, for example the original deeds of the property to rebuke that the dwelling was constructed after the 1st July 1948 then this should be submitted with any re-submission. Officers have not sought clarity on this matter mindful that the proposal is also unacceptable on other grounds which are outlined above."
