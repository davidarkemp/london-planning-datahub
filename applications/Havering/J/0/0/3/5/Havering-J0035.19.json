    "Prior Approval is refused  because the proposal exceed maximum amount 450sqm, each individual unit size exceeds 100sqm and the number of the dwelling would exceed three. In these respects the proposal fails Class Q1b(i) of the GPDO 2015 as amended.",
    "In terms of operation the proposal would fail to satisfy the test given in Paragraph W of the GPDO. This paragraph makes it clear that the onus is on the developer to provide sufficient information to enable the local planning authority to establish whether the proposed development complies with any conditions, limitation or restrictions imposed by the Order. In this case there is no evidence which demonstrates that the existing foundations and frame could support the first floor and other works to insert a new floor, external walls without further structural changes. On the face of it is considered that the conversion would necessitate structural works which go beyond the installation or replacement of windows, doors, roofs or exterior walls to the extent reasonably necessary for the building to function as a dwellinghouse as set out in the GPDO. In this respect to proposal fails to satisfy the Class Q(b)(i)(i) of the General Permitted Development Order 2015 as amended.",
    "It is considered that the proposal fails to meet the conditions set out in the Class Q2 of the order. The application provides insufficient information with respect to the contamination and noise issues of the development. Further the council would have concern with respect to the aesthetic aspect of the development."
