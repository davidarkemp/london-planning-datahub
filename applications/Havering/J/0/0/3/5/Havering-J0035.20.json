    "Prior Approval under Class M, Part 3, Schedule of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended) is refused on the grounds that the proposed change of use does not comply with the provisions of Class O. This is a resubmission of an earlier application within which the applicant denoted that the use class of the site was A2, however in the current submission identifies the site as B1(a). Whilst historically the site has been referred to as a \"building contractors\" and an \"office\", it is unclear whether the lawful use of the site would be a B1(a) use. No evidence or detail of the function of the premises has been submitted to support the assertion that the site is in B1(a) use. Without clarity the proposals fail to comply with the provisions of Class O."
