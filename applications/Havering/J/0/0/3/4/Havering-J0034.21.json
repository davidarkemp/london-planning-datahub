    "The proposed development does not comply with condition 3 of Class AB, which states that \"Any development under Class AB is permitted subject to the condition that the development must not include a window in any wall or roof slope forming a side elevation of the building\". There is a window on the proposed south elevation of the building that would serve the hallway to Flat F2 on the second floor. Consequently, under the provisions of Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development)(England) Order 2020 [as amended], the prior approval of the Local Planning Authority is refused.",
    "The proposed development does not comply with criteria 9A(b) of Class AB, which states that \"Schedule 2 does not grant permission for, or authorise any development of, any new dwellinghouse that does not comply with the nationally described space standard issued by the Department for Communities and Local Government on 27th March 2015(1)\".",
    "The double bedroom of Flats F1 and F2 has a width of between 2.3 and 2.4 metres, which does not meet the width of 2.75 metres in line with the DCLG Technical  Space Standards. Consequently, under the provisions of Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development)(England) Order 2020 [as amended], the prior approval of the Local Planning Authority is refused.",
    "In the absence of a legal agreement to prevent future occupants from applying for or obtaining a residents parking permit, the proposal fails to satisfactorily mitigate the parking impacts of the development. Consequently, under the provisions of Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development)(England) Order 2020 [as amended], the prior approval of the Local Planning Authority is refused.",
    "Insufficient information has been provided with respect to cycle storage, refuse and recycling storage and servicing, which may impact upon highway safety and the free flow of traffic. Consequently, under the provisions of Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development)(England) Order 2020 [as amended], the prior approval of the Local Planning Authority is refused."
