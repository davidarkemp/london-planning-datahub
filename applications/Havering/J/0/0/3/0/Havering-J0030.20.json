    "The development  would result in more than 150 square metres of floor space in the building having changed use under Class M, and would therefore fail to comply with Schedule 2, Part 3, Class M.1 (c ) and (d) of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 [as amended].  As such, the local planning authority considers that prior approval should not be given.",
    "The information provided by the developer fails to demonstrate that the required level of demolition to the link building located to the rear of site would be acceptable, therefore in accordance with Schedule 2, Part 3, Class M.1 (f) of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 [as amended], the prior approval of the Local Planning Authority is refused.",
    "The Council consider that the proposed development would result in poor living conditions and amenity for future occupants due to the insufficient provision of natural light to all habitable rooms. The application fails to demonstrate that adequate provision of natural light would be made. Consequently, under the provisions of Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development)(England) Order 2015 [as amended], the prior approval of the Local Planning Authority is refused."
