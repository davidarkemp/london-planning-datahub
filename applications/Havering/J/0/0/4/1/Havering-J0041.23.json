    "According to a Google Streetview image dated October 2022, the single storey building was a stand-alone structure, which was not connected or linked to the main building at No. 129 Abbs Cross Lane. The plans show a building which is three metres deeper than what is shown on the Ordnance Survey and most recent aerial and Google Streetview images. The site photographs show that the building has been extended with a lower roof ridge, as such the link or extension joining the structure to the main shop building is not lawful as its less than 4 years old and it doesn't have planning permission. As such, the structure in question is not an original part of the building. The permitted development legislation doesn't allow extensions. The site photographs for application J0020.23 show the building has a new roof with roof lights and a window has been added on its rear elevation, which  demonstrates that the alterations had already started prior to the determination of this application.
