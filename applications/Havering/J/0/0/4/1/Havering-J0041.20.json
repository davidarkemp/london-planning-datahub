  "decision_conditions": [
    "The creation of an additional storey to the existing two storey semi-detached dwelling would, by reason of its height, scale and mass, appear overbearing, dominant and visually intrusive and result in undue loss of amenity including loss of outlook, light and privacy to nearby residents especially at no. 630 Upper Brentwood Road and no. 4 Farnes Drive. Consequently, under the provisions of Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development)(England) Order 2020 [as amended], the prior approval of the Local Planning Authority is refused.",
    "The creation of an additional storey to the existing two storey semi-detached dwelling would, by reason of its height, scale, bulk and mass, appear incongruous and out of character in the street scene and rear garden environment harmful to the appearance of the dwelling itself and the character and appearance of the surrounding area. Consequently, under the provisions of Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development)(England) Order 2020 [as amended], the prior approval of the Local Planning Authority is refused."
