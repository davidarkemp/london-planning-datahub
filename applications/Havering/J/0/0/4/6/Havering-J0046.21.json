    "Prior to the first occupation of the dwelling hereby permitted, the proposed vertical cycle storage shall be provided in accordance with the details shown on  Drawing No. 1522_303A. The cycle storage shall be permanently retained thereafter.",
    "Reason In the interests of providing a wide range of facilities for non-motor car residents and sustainability.",
    "Prior to commencement of the development, the applicant shall provide a scheme to the Local Planning Authority for its written approval detailing sound transmission reduction measures to be installed within the separating walls and floor between the proposed dwelling and existing commercial/residential premises that share a party wall/floor to limit airborne sound transmission and impact noise.
