  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposal fails to constitute permitted development under Part 20 Class AA of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) (Amendment) (No. 2) Order 2020, because the application building is not a detached building, and hence prior approval is refused.",
    "In the absence of a legal agreement to ensure that future occupiers of the site would be excluded from obtaining  parking permits within over subscribed Residential Parking Zones, the proposal would have an adverse impact upon the amenities of the existing residents and be detrimental to the free flow of traffic and highway safety",
    "The proposal would be CIL liable. The total floor space would be 730sqm. This would equate to £18,250 mayoral CIL and £91,250 Havering CIL",
    "You are advised to visit the planning portal website where you can download the appropriate document templates.",
