    "The Council consider that the proposed development would result in poor living conditions and amenity for future occupants due to the insufficient provision of natural light to the proposed habitable room. The application fails to demonstrate that adequate provision of natural light would be made. Consequently, under the provisions of Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development)(England) Order 2015 [as amended], the prior approval of the Local Planning Authority is refused."
