    "Prior Approval is required (given) in accordance with the details as provided within the application.",
    "Before the proposed development hereby permitted commences details of a scheme shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority which specifies the provisions to be made for the control of road traffic noise from London Road and the retained commercial units upon the residential dwellings. Such scheme as may be approved shall be implemented prior to first occupation of he residential units and thereafter retained in accordance with such details.",
    "Reason:  To prevent noise nuisance to adjoining/adjacent properties.",
    "No building shall be occupied or use commenced until cycle storage is provided in accordance with the details shown on drawing no.DR.88.EX&PR.FP.01 . The cycle storage shall be permanently retained thereafter.",
    "Reason:-",
    "An inadequate arrangement has been shown and consequently insufficient information has been supplied with the application to demonstrate what facilities will be available for cycle parking.  Submission of this detail prior to occupation in the case of new building works or prior to the use commencing in the case of changes of use is in the interests of providing a wide range of facilities for non-motor car residents and sustainability.",
    "Prior to the first occupation of the development, details shall be submitted to and agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority for the installation of Ultra-Low NOx boilers with maximum NOx Emissions less than 40 mg/kWh. Where any installations do not meet this emissions standard it should not be operated without the fitting of suitable NOx abatement equipment or technology as determined by a specialist to ensure comparable emissions. The installation of the boilers shall be carried out in strict accordance with the agreed details and shall thereafter be permanently retained. Following installation emissions certificates will need to be provided to the Local Planning Authority to verify boiler emissions.",
    "Reason: To minimise the impact of building emissions on local air quality.",
    "No building shall be occupied or use commenced until details of a waste management scheme is submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority. The scheme shall include details of the method and location of refuse and recycling storage, together with arrangements for refuse disposal. The scheme shall be implemented on site, in accordance with the approved details, prior to the first occupation or commencement of the use hereby approved and retained permanently thereafter.",
    "Reason:-",
    "Insufficient information has been supplied with the application to judge how waste will be managed on site.  Submission of this detail prior to occupation in the case of new building works or prior to the use commencing in the case of changes of use will protect the amenity of occupiers of nearby premises, and ensure that the development accords with the Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policy DC61.",
    "The change of use as described in this Prior Approval notification must be commenced not later than three years from the date of this decision."
