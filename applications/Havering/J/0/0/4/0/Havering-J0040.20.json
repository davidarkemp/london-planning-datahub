    "The proposal fails to constitute permitted development under Part 20 Class A of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) (Amendment) (No. 2) Order 2020, because the scope of development proposed relates to development below the topmost residential storey and an expansion of the existing third floor that are not classified as permitted development, and hence prior approval is refused.",
    "The proposal would be CIL liable. The total floor space would be 260sqm. This would equate to £6500 mayoral CIL and £32500 Havering CIL",
