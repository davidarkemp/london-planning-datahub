    "The proposal would result in increased demand for car parking spaces in the vicinity of the site and wider town centre area where there is very limited availability of parking permit spaces for existing residents. In the absence of an agreement under Section 16 of the Greater London Council (General Powers) Act 1974 to prevent future occupiers of the proposed dwellings from obtaining parking permits, it is considered that there would be no appropriate mitigating measures to ensure there would be no impact on the availability of parking for existing residents with resultant harm to the amenity and convenience of existing residents in the area and the safe and free flow of traffic on nearby streets. In this respect the proposal is unacceptable in terms of transport and highways impacts."
