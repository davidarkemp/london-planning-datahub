    "The cumulative impact of the proposed development would, by reason of its excessive height, scale, bulk, mass and siting, appear incongruous, overbearing, dominant, visually intrusive and out of character in the streetscene and the surrounding area and would be harmful to the amenity of neighbouring properties, in particular 6B and 6A Moor Lane. Consequently, under the provisions of Schedule 2, Part 20, Class AA of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development)(England) Order 2021 [as amended], the prior approval of the Local Planning Authority is refused.",
    "In the absence of any on-site vehicular parking, the creation of eight one bedroom flats would therefore, be likely to result in an undesirable increase in on-street parking to the detriment of highway safety and residential amenity. Consequently, under the provisions of Schedule 2, Part 20, Class AA of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development)(England) Order 2021 [as amended], the prior approval of the Local Planning Authority is refused."
