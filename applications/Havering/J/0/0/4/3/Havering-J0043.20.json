    "The change of use of the first and second floors from use class A2 (Financial Services) to Use Class C3 (Residential) to create 3x 1-bed self-contained flats is contrary to the conditions for M.2 (1), which state that where the development proposed is development under Class M(a) together with development under Class M(b), development is permitted subject to the condition that before beginning the development, the developer must apply to the local planning authority for a determination as to whether the prior approval of the authority will be required as to criteria a) to e). However, in this case, planning application P0049.18 was implemented and works were undertaken to convert the building from an A2 use to residential accommodation (a three bedroom, five person HMO)."
