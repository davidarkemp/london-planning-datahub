    "The operations do not fall within the provisions of Schedule 2, Part 1, Classes A and B of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 2015, as amended. Specifically, there is a condition inserted on a previous planning application for the site (ref: P1451.10) which restricts permitted development rights for Classes A - E of Schedule 2, Part 1 of the General Permitted Development Order. As such, planning permission is required for the proposed developments. Also, the proposed front and rear windows are not considered to comply with criteria set out in Class A because they would not give a similar visual appearance to windows of the existing dwelling in terms of their shape and frame size. Furthermore, the proposed side dormer windows would include windows that would not be obscure-glazed and non-opening unless the parts of the window which can be opened are more than 1.7 metres above the floor of the room in which the window is installed."
