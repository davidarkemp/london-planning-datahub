  "decision_conditions": [
    "The roof enlargement of the detached property including double hip to gable and the proposed rear dormer window  would have a volume of 53.66 cubic metres and therefore would exceed 50 cubic metres allowance outlined in Schedule 2, Part 1, Classes B and C of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 and as a result a planning application will be required due to the fact the proposed volume exceeds 50 cubic metres.",
    "It has not been satisfactorily demonstrated that the extent of the works proposed, which involve the removal of a significant proportion of the existing extended roof, falls within the scope of permitted development which is limited to an addition or alteration to the roof rather than significant rebuild of the roof structure."
