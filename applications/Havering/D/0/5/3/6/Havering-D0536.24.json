    "Class C3(b) only covers up to six people (adults) living together as a single household and receiving care. The application proposes 6 adults who would live in the house in the care of 1 adult carer at all times, which would exceed the maximum number of people covered by Class C3(b). Furthermore, as those providing the care would not reside at the property full time, they cannot be regarded as living together with the adults as a single household. Therefore, it can be concluded that the proposal proposes a material change from an HMO for which planning permission is required."
