    "The proposal involves the demolition of the existing garage which would be more than 50 cubic metres in a conservation area which is not permitted development by virtue of Schedule 2, Part 11, Class B, B.1 (b), Section 196D of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 and the Town and Country Planning (Demolition - Description of Buildings) Direction 2021. As a result, a planning application will be required.",
    "It is considered that there is insufficient evidence that the structure can be moved on and off the premises and therefore it is suggested that a planning permission would be required for the proposal.",
    "It is considered that there is insufficient and conflicting information provided to be able to conclude that the caravan would not form a separate household and represent a material change of use of the land to a separate residential unit or would amount to development, and therefore it is suggested that a planning permission would be required for the proposal."
