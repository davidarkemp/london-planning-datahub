    "The terms of the enforcement notice required the premises cease use as a HMO and the applicant confirms that the terms of the notice have been complied with and the premises has remained vacant since 2018. Consequently through the Article 4 Direction in place within the Borough which came into force July 2016 planning permission would be required in this location for a COU to a HMO. Insufficient evidence has been provided to conclude on the matter of whether the premises was in C4 use prior to the Article 4 Direction. Planning permission is therefore required for the use of the premises as a HMO."
