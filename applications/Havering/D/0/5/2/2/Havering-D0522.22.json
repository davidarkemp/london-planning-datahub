    "The local planning authority has not adopted a screening opinion to the effect that an Environmental Impact Assessment is not required, in accordance with Article 3 (10) of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015. An application for a screening opinion should have been made and screening opinion adopted in advance of any application for a Certificate of Lawfulness.",
    "It has not been satisfactorily demonstrated that the proposed solar panels could be considered to constitute \"plant\". It is considered that \"plant\" would normally comprise something used in connection with the use of land or an associated building. The panels could only be considered to be plant (i.e. used in connection) if they were to be used to directly power all or parts of the sewerage works. It appears that the solar panels would be directly connected to the grid rather than to individual parts of the sewerage works and therefore they could not be considered as plant and are structures (building) not permitted under Part 13, Class B (f)."
