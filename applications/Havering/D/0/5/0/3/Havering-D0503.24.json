    "Please note that this certificate is granted for the outbuildings to be used as a games room & store room as described on the submitted plans. It must only be used for purposes incidental to the enjoyment of No.23 Lime Avenue, Upminster and not for any trade or business nor as living accommodation. Should business or living accommodation use be intended, an application for full planning permission must be applied for and permission granted before such use could occur. The use of outbuildings as living accommodation is not typically deemed acceptable therefore it is important the outbuildings are only used for the purposes as listed above.",

    "This certificate provides confirmation that the development is lawful.  You should also check whether the development requires separate Building Regulation consent.
