    "Please note that this certificate is granted for the outbuilding to be used only for swimming pool, swimming pool enclosure and incidental uses associated for a private swimming pool to the enjoyment of the principle occupiers of 26 Heather Close, Romford, and not for any trade or business nor as living accommodation. Should business or living accommodation use be intended, an application for full planning permission must be applied for and permission granted before such use could occur. The use of outbuildings as living accommodation or any other use is not typically deemed acceptable therefore it is important the outbuilding is only used for the purposes as listed above."
