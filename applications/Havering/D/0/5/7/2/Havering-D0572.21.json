Please note that any other addition to the house, including the approved scheme for Part two storey, part single storey side/rear extensions (ref: P1597.21) before the completion of the loft extension would be likely to invalidate the Certificate. You are therefore advised the Certificate be built and not in combination with the rest of the works approved under this address, otherwise the Certificate already given would cease to apply which would require planning permission and is less likely to be supported."
