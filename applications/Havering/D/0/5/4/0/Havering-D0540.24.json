    "The size of the outbuilding relative to the main dwelling in the absence of any compelling evidence otherwise is an indicator that its uses would not be incidental or subordinate to the main use of the dwellinghouse. As such, it is not considered that the totality of the proposed outbuilding is genuinely and reasonably required to achieve the purpose of accommodating incidental activities. The building would be set within 2m of the boundary with No. 59 Havering Road and having an overall height of over 2.5m. The proposed development is therefore not considered to be in accordance with the provisions of Schedule 2, Part 1, Class E of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 2015.",
    "For Residential Development Only",
    "Please be advised that approval of this application from 1st September 2019 (either by London Borough of Havering, or subsequently by PINS if allowed on appeal following a refusal by London Borough of Havering) will attract a liability payment of £3,375 plus indexation in Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This charge has been levied under s.206 of the Planning Act 2008 and includes both the Mayor of London's CIL and Havering Council's CIL.",
    "London Borough of Havering, as CIL collecting authority, has responsibility for the collection of the Mayoral CIL, in addition to Havering's CIL, on commencement of the development.",
    "Your proposal is subject to a CIL Liability Notice indicating a levy of £16,875 plus indexation for the application, based on the Mayoral CIL levy rate for Havering of £25/sq.m plus Havering's charging rate for residential of £125/sq.m (Zone A), and the floorspace of 135 square metres."
