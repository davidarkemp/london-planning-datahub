    "The development approved under application reference P0295.20 has been lawfully commenced. The digging of an appropriate trench for part of the foundations constitutes a material act defined as defined within Section 56 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended). Before doing so, any pre-commencement conditions had been satisfactorily discharged as far as necessary. As such, planning permission is not required.",
    "A trench had been dug in commencement of a development.",
    "Section 56 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended) does not state that there should be no intervening act between the digging of the trench and the pouring of concrete therein. Accordingly, by backfilling the earth which has been taken out of the trench would not necessarily deprive it of the character of a trench. It is not necessary for a trench to remain open from the time it was dug to the laying of foundations."
