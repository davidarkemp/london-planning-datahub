    "Implementation of Proposal Information",
    "The applicant should note that any connection of the proposed single storey rear extension to the existing garage in any way will invalidate this the certificate of lawfulness, as the proposal would be more than half the width of the existing dwelling and would extend beyond the side elevation of the existing dwelling and be contrary to permitted development legislation.",
    "This certificate provides confirmation that the development is lawful.  You should also check whether the development requires separate Building Regulation consent. Information is available on the Building Control webpages and the team is available between 9am and 10am Monday to Friday via 01708 432700."
