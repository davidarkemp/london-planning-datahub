    "The proposal fails to come within the provisions of Schedule 2, Part 1, Class B of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 thereby planning permission is required. The proposed dormer would adjoin an existing single storey extension and would therefore extend beyond the outside face of an external wall of the original dwelling house and would read as a fist floor extension. Records held by the Council confirm that the original projection to the rear was demolished to facilitate the extension in situ. Furthermore the extension would not be constructed out of matching materials. The proposed materials for the dormer suggest a rendered finish which does not match the existing roof which uses roof tiles and the dormer and would also be formed as part of the flank elevation."
