    "The operations come within the provisions of Schedule 2, Part 1, Class E of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended), thereby considered to be permitted development.",
    "This certificate provides confirmation that the development is lawful.  You should also check whether the development requires separate Building Regulation consent. Information is available on the Building Control webpages via http://www.havering.gov.uk/Pages/Category/Building-control.aspx?l1=200252 and the team is available between 9am and 10am Monday to Friday via 01708 432700.",
    "This planning permission does not remove the need to obtain any separate consent of the owner of the adjoining property prior to commencing building works on, under, above or immediately adjacent to their property (e.g. foundations or guttering). The Party Wall Etc. Act 1996 contains requirements to serve notice on adjoining owners of property under certain circumstances, and a procedure exists for resolving disputes. This is a matter of civil law between the two parties, and the Local Planning Authority are not involved in such matters.",
    "A free guide called \"The Party Wall Etc Act 1996: Explanatory Booklet\" is available on the website of the Department for Communities and Local Government.",

    "Applicant should be aware of the need to put in place adequate tree protection measures for the protection of the mature trees located on the eastern side of the site prior to the commencement of the hereby approved development.  Such protection measures shall be retained in place until the approved development is completed.",
    "Please note that this certificate is granted for the outbuilding to be used only for purposes incidental to the enjoyment of 50 Avenue Road, and not for any trade or business nor as living accommodation. Should business or living accommodation use be intended, an application for full planning permission must be applied for and permission granted before such use could occur. The use of outbuildings as living accommodation is not typically deemed acceptable therefore it is important the outbuilding is only used for the purposes as listed above."
