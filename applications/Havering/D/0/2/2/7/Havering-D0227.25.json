    "On the evidence presented, the Council is not satisfied, that the totality of the proposed outbuilding is genuinely and reasonably required to achieve the purpose of accommodating the proposed incidental activities, by reason of its excessive size. It therefore would not fall within the parameters of Class E, Part 1, Schedule 2 of the GPDO.",
    "Please be advised that approval of this application from 1st September 2019 (either by London Borough of Havering, or subsequently by PINS if allowed on appeal following a refusal by London Borough of Havering) will attract a liability payment in Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This charge has been levied under s.206 of the Planning Act 2008 and includes both the Mayor of London's CIL and Havering Council's CIL.",
    "London Borough of Havering, as CIL collecting authority, has responsibility for the collection of the Mayoral CIL, in addition to Havering's CIL, on commencement of the development.",
    "Your proposal is subject to a CIL Liability Notice indicating a levy plus indexation for the application, based on the Mayoral CIL levy rate for Havering of £25/sq.m plus Havering's charging rate for residential of £125/sq.m.  126/sq.m of space is proposed so £3,150 and £15,750 is payable.",
