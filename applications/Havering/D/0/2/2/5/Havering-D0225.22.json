Highway Authority approval will only be given after suitable details have been submitted considered and agreed. If new or amended access is required (whether temporary or permanent), there may be a requirement for the diversion or protection of third party utility plant or highway authority assets and it is recommended that early involvement with the relevant statutory undertaker takes place. The applicant must contact Engineering Services on 01708 433751 to discuss the scheme and commence the relevant highway approvals process. Please note that unauthorised work on the highway is an offence.",

Information is available on the Building Control webpages and the team is available between 9am and 10am Monday to Friday via 01708 432700.",

This is a matter of civil law between the two parties, and the Local Planning Authority are not involved in such matters.",
