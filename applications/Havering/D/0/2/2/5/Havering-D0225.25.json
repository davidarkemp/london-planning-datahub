    "The existing and proposed roof enlargements to the detached property would have a volume of 72.02 cubic metres and therefore would exceed 50 cubic metres allowance outlined in Schedule 2, Part 1, Classes B of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015. As a result, a planning application will be required due to the fact the proposed volume would exceed 50 cubic metres.",
    "It has not been clearly demonstrated on the submitted drawings that the proposed rear dormer would comply with Class B of Schedule 2, Part 1 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015, in that the face and cheeks of the cheeks of the rear dormer window will be tile hung to give a similar visual appearance to roof of the existing house. The materials used for the face and cheeks of dormer should be tile hung to have the appearance and the similar colour and design used in the main roof of the house when viewed from ground level. An annotation should have been added to the proposed drawings to reflect this.",
    "It has not been clearly demonstrated on the submitted drawings that the proposed roof lights would comply with Class C of Schedule 2, Part 1 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015, in that the proposed roof lights would not protrude more than 0.15 metres beyond the plane of the slope of the original roof. A proposed cross section and/or annotation should have been added to the proposed drawings to reflect this."
