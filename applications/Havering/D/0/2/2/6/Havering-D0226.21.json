    "The proposal fails to come within the provisions of Schedule 2, Part 1, Classes A and B of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015, as it doesn't accord with Class A (e) (i) as the enlarged part of the dwellinghouse extends beyond a wall which forms the principal elevation of the original dwellinghouse. The proposed loft conversion does not accord with Class B, including section (B1) (c) as the proposed hip to gable conversion at the front would go beyond the plane of the existing roof slope which forms the principal elevation of the dwellinghouse and fronts a highway. Therefore planning permission is required.",
    "It is noted that the front extension would not constitute a front porch and therefore has not been assessed against Class D (front porches) as it does not propose the 'erection of a porch outside any external door of a house' as there was never an existing front door in that location.",
    "The front extension has already been built (existing) and therefore this application which is for a 'proposed use' is not correct for that element of the proposal and should rather be for an 'existing use' application. Although as it does not accord with the Permitted Development (PD) rights under Class A, it is recommended to apply for 'retrospective' planning permission (householder application) for the front extension.",
