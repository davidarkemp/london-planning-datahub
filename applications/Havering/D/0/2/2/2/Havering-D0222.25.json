    "The operations come within the provisions of Schedule 2, Part 1, Class E of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015, thereby not requiring planning permission.",
    "Construction of Outbuilding Informative",
    "The applicant should note that any increase in overall height above 2.5m, as a result of incoporating Flood Resilient measures would require a planning application.",
    "Land Ownership Informative",
    "The applicant is advised that this planning permission does not give consent for any part of the development including guttering and fascias to encroach onto any land not within the applicant's ownership.",
    "Lawful Development Certificate Outbuilding Informative",
    "Please note that this certificate is granted for the outbuilding to be used for gym/playroom as described on the submitted plans. It must only be used for purposes incidental to the enjoyment of 32 Penerley Road, Rainham and not for any trade or business including meetings nor as living accommodation. Should business including meeting or living accommodation use be intended, an application for full planning permission must be applied for and permission granted before such use could occur. The use of outbuildings as living accommodation is not typically deemed acceptable therefore it is important the outbuilding is only used for the purposes as listed above.",
    "Flood Resilience Informative",
    "For any development where a flood risk is identified, the Council as the Lead Local Flood Authority want to see developers consider and implement flood resilience/resistance measures into the buildings themselves. This is not to stop development but to ensure the protection for future residents is maintained and enhanced.",
    "The following measures are strongly recommended, although this list is not exhaustive:-",
    "-         Raising the level of the building by at least 300mm above local levels;",
    "-         Waterproof membrane in the ground floor;",
    "-         Waterproof plaster and waterproofing to ground floor;",
    "-         Electrics from the upstairs down and sockets high up off the ground floor;",
    "-         Non return valves on the sewerage pipes;",
    "-         Emergency escape plan for each individual property;",
    "-         Air brick covers; and",
    "-         Movable flood barriers for entrances",
    "Building Regs Informative",
    "This certificate provides confirmation that the development is lawful.  You should also check whether the development requires separate Building Regulation consent. Information is available on the Building Control webpages via http://www.havering.gov.uk/Pages/Category/Building-control.aspx?l1=200252 and the team is available between 9am and 10am Monday to Friday via 01708 432700."
