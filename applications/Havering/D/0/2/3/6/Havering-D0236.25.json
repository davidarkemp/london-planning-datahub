    "The existing and proposed roof enlargements to the semi-detached property would have a volume of 56.15 cubic metres and therefore would exceed 50 cubic metres allowance outlined in Schedule 2, Part 1, Classes B of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015. As a result, a planning application will be required due to the fact the proposed volume would exceed 50 cubic metres.",
    "The development is not permitted by Class B of Schedule 2, Part 1 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015, one of the cheeks of the rear dormer window are not finished using materials that give a similar visual appearance to roof of the existing house. The materials used for the cheek of dormer would be face brick and therefore are not tiled to have the appearance and the similar colour and design used in the main roof of the house when viewed from ground level."
