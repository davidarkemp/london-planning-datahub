    "The proposed conversion of the existing garage to habitable use requires planning permission by reason of Condition 3 of planning permission reference L/HAV 2430/73 dated 19/11/1973, which removed Permitted Development Rights for use of the garage for any other purposes other than storage of vehicles. In addition, the proposal would result in an extension having a width greater than half the width of the original dwellinghouse. As such,  the proposal would not be within the tolerances of Schedule 2, Part 1 Classes A, of The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "The proposal is therefore not a lawful development."
