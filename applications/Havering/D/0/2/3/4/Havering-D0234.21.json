    "The application indicates that the proposal is for extensions to a single family dwellinghouse, however it is noted that the property was originally constructed as flats. Whilst the application drawings, information from the agent and planning history suggest the property has since been converted into a single family dwelling there is no formal confirmation of this.  As such, the applicant is advised to apply for a Certificate of Lawfulness (Existing Use) to confirm that the dwelling has reverted back to be used as a single family dwellinghouse before any works take place or further Certificate is applied for.  If the property remains in use as two flats, any Certificate of Lawfulness for building works would not be able to be relied upon, as flats would not benefit from permitted development rights."
