    "The size of the outbuilding relative to the main dwelling in the absence of any compelling evidence otherwise is an indicator that its uses are unlikely to be ancillary or subordinate to the main use of the building as a dwelling. As such it is not considered that the totality of the proposed outbuilding is genuinely and reasonably required to achieve the purpose of accommodating incidental activities. The proposed outbuilding is therefore not considered to be in accordance with the provisions of Schedule 2, Part 1, Class E of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 2015."
