Based upon the information supplied with the application, the Mayoral CIL payable would be £3,400 based on the calculation of £25.00 per square metre and the Havering Community Infrastructure Levy (HCIL) would be a charge of £17000 based on calculation of £125 per square metre. Each would be subject to indexation.",
