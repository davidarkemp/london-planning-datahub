It is considered the proposed living accommodation / residential use forms the main function of a dwelling - and therefore would not be considered as an incidental use. An incidental use generally denotes to uses e.g.  storage, swimming enclosures, gym, art studio, or something that can be classed as a hobby or similar. An incidental use might also be considered as a use which cannot exists on its own, but one which depends upon the main use of a planning unit."
