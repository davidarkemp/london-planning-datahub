    "The proposal would not fall within class C3(b) which covers up to six people living together as a single household receiving care.   Insufficient information has been provided to demonstrate that the occupants would form a single household engaging in a range of communal activities; the age range of the occupants has not been provided, the level of needs of the occupants has not been provided and details of the level of care, number of carers, shift patterns has not been provided.  Consequently the proposal would fall outside class C3 grouping and would therefore not be compliant with the Town and Country Planning (Use Classes Order) 1987 as amended."
