    "Lawful Development Certificate Outbuilding Informative",
    "Please note that this certificate is granted for the outbuilding to be used for garden room as described on the submitted plans. It must only be used for purposes incidental to the enjoyment of 5 Athelstan Close, Romford and not for any trade or business including meetings nor as living accommodation. Should business including meeting or living accommodation use be intended, an application for full planning permission must be applied for and permission granted before such use could occur. The use of outbuildings as living accommodation is not typically deemed acceptable therefore it is important the outbuilding is only used for the purposes as listed above.",

    "This certificate provides confirmation that the development is lawful.  You should also check whether the development requires separate Building Regulation consent.
