    "The proposed use of the outbuilding at 31 Carlisle Road, Romford, as a dog grooming business would constitute as development as set out in Section 192 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended). The proposal would be for a business use which is not considered to be incidental to the primary use of the property as a residential dwelling and would therefore not be lawful. As such, planning permission would be required."
