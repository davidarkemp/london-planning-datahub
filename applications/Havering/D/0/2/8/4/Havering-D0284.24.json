    "The proposed side rooflights which are not indicated to not protrude more than 0.15 metres beyond the plane of the slope of the original roofs on which they are located, and to not be higher than the highest part of the roof. As a result, the roof lights would not comply with Class C, and could not be done under permitted development, would therefore require planning consent."
