    "The proposed development does not constitute permitted development by virtue of Condition 12 of planning permission ref: P1205.97 dated 06th February 1998 which states that \"Notwithstanding the provisions of Schedule 2, Part 1, Classes A-H of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order l995, no enlargement, improvement or other alterations to the proposed dwellinghouse shall be carried out unless specific permission under the provisions of the Town and Country Planning Act l990 has first been sought and obtained in writing from the Local Planning Authority. The property does therefore not benefit from Permitted Development Rights under Part 1 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development)(Amendment)(No.2)(England) Order 2015. The development proposed therefore requires planning permission."
