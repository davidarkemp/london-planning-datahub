    "Please note that this certificate is granted for the outbuilding to be used as a detached double garage with garden store / workshop to maintain land as shown on submitted drawings. It must only be used for purposes incidental to the enjoyment of Corner Farm Cottage, Fen Lane, North Ockendon, Upminster RM14 3RB and not for any trade or business nor as living accommodation. Should business or living accommodation use be intended, an application for full planning permission must be applied for and permission granted before such use could occur. The use of outbuildings as living accommodation is not typically deemed acceptable therefore it is important the outbuilding is only used for the purposes as listed above.",
