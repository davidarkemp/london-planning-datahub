    "The premises are stated to be in Class E(a) (Display or retail sale of goods), although the planning history does not support this. Based upon planning application P0314.93, the last authorised use of the premises was a car showroom and this is a Sui Generis use. Therefore, a change of use from a car showroom - Sui Generis to a restaurant under Class E(c) is not permitted development and requires planning permission. Additionally, the description of the proposal refers to a change of use to Use Class E(c) (Sale of food and drink for consumption (mostly) on the premises), but the provision of a restaurant and takeaway would be a Sui Generis use.   As such, the proposals do not fall within the criteria set out in Schedule 2, Part A, Class E of the Town and Country Planning (Use Classes) (Amendment) (England) Regulations 2020 and as such require planning permission."
