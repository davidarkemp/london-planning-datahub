    "The proposed development is considered to fail to be in accordance with the provisions of Schedule 2, Part 1, Class B and C of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 2015.  The total volume of the rear dormer plus the roof of the two-storey side extension exceeds 50 cubic metres.  To be permitted development any additional roof space created must not increase the volume of the original roof space of the house by more than 50 cubic metres for semi-detached houses. Any previous enlargement to the original roof space in any part of the house must be included in this volume allowance.  As the property has benefited from a two storey side extension which connects to the roof at the front of the dwelling (evidenced by the guttering), the volume of the side extension roof needs to be included"
