    "The proposal fails to come within the provisions of Schedule 2, Part 1, Class A of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015, thereby planning permission is required as the proposed development extend beyond a wall which forms the principal elevation of the original dwellinghouse and would have a cumulative volume of more than 3 cubic metre.",
    "Please be aware that permitted development rights have more than likely been removed for this property. Due to Covid-19 officers are unable to check historic documents to confirm this. If any further application for a garage conversion is submitted please note a historic check will form part of the assessment."
