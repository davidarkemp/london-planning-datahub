    "In the absence of sufficient information about whether the occupants will form a single household, the proposed use is not considered to be demonstrated to fall within Class C3(b) of the Use Classes Order (as amended) and based on the information available the layout and use of the premises is likely to give rise to a material change of use of the property.  Furthermore, the application is reliant on a single storey rear extension that appears to be unlawful and requires planning permission.  For these reasons, the applicant has failed to demonstrate that the proposed use of the property would be lawful and the Certificate is therefore refused."
