    "Should the circumstances of the property/occupants and activities change it may be that planning permission would be required. A material change of use may present in the level of activity at the property through comings and goings and turnover of residents in a manner which would not be consistent with the use of a dwelling as a single dwelling house. It is the responsibility of the applicant to ensure that the operations associated with 102 Lake Rise remain lawful."
