Information is available on the Building Control webpages and the team is available between 9am and 10am Monday to Friday via 01708 432700.",

    "the outside edge of the eaves; and",
    "(ii) other than in the case of an enlargement which joins the original roof to the roof of a rear or side extension, no part of the enlargement extends beyond the outside face of any external wall of the original dwellinghouse; and",

    "The applicant is reminded that this Certificate is only valid if the works as proposed herein are completed in accordance with drawing no. 19/411/012. It is noted that the applicant has various approvals for other sets of extensions including P0521.23, P1654.23 and Y0289.23. If works are undertaken and the schemes for either P0521.23 or P1654.23 are fully implemented it is unlikely that the rear facing dormer subject to this application can be built such that it matches drawing no. 19/411/012. If this is the case it is likely Permitted Development Rights relevant to this Certificate would become void."
