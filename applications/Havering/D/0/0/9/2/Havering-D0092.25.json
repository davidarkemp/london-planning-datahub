    "Insufficient information has been provided as to the level of care the residents would receive and how the residents would form a single household. On the basis that the use represents a change of use from C3, based on the proposed plans and supporting information that has been provided, the nature of the operation would be materially different to the lawful use as a single dwelling within Class C3(a)  in terms of nature of accommodation and intensification of use of the property.",
    "The existing and proposed floor plans on Drawing No.'s 1-01 and 1-02 show accommodation in the roof space. This proposal relies on accommodation built in the loft of the dwelling that was constructed in the last four years, which requires and does not benefit from planning permission or permitted development. A certificate cannot be issued involving unlawful works."
