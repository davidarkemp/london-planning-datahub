    "The proposal would not fall within class C3(b) which covers up to six people living together as a single household receiving care.   Insufficient information has been provided to demonstrate that the occupants would form a single household; in particular the carers would not be residing within the dwelling and hence they would not form a household with those receiving care. Further the individual residents could be receiving one to one care which means they would not form a household consequently the proposal would fall outside class C3 grouping and would therefore not be compliant with the Town and Country Planning (Use Classes Order) 1987 as amended."
