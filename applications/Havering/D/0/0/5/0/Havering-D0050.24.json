Information is available on the Building Control webpages and the team is available between 9am and 10am Monday to Friday via 01708 432700.",
    "The development is permitted by Class B subject to the following conditions-",
    "(a) the materials used in any exterior work must be of a similar appearance to those used",
    "in the construction of the exterior of the existing dwellinghouse;",
    "(b) the enlargement must be constructed so that-",

    "The applicant is reminded that they cannot build the hip-to-gable loft conversion and rear dormer as deemed lawful under this Cetificate as well as the first floor rear extension approved under P1649.23 in one building operation. If the rear facing dormer and first floor rear extension are built neither would accord their the approved plans from their respective applications. It is recommended the loft conversion and rear dormer are built first and then once finalised a fresh planning application for the first floor rear extension be submitted."
