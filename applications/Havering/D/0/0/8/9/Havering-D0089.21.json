    "The operations do not accord within the provisions of Schedule 2, Part 1, Class A of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 2015, as amended. The proposed rear extension extend beyond the rear wall of the original terraced dwellinghouse by more than 3 metres. Whilst a prior approval has previously been issued, the proposed single-storey rear extension would have a maximum height and eaves height exceeding that of the prior approval reference Y0007.21, dated 10-02-2021. As such, the proposal does not constitute permitted development."
