    "The operations come within the provisions of Section of 55 of The Town and Country Planning Act 1990 as amended and therefore the proposal would not require planning permission.",
    "The applicant is advised that the Certificate hereby granted only confirms the lawfulness of the conversion of the garage to a habitable room integral to the dwelling and associated works.  The habitable room created through the conversion can only be used only for living accommodation as an integral part of the existing dwelling known as No.12 Balmoral Road, Hornchurch and planning permission would be required for use as a separate unit of residential accommodation.",
    "This certificate provides confirmation that the development is lawful.  You should also check whether the development requires separate Building Regulation consent. Information is available on the Building Control webpages via http://www.havering.gov.uk/Pages/Category/Building-control.aspx?l1=200252 and the team is available between 9am and 10am Monday to Friday via 01708 432700."
