    "Class C3(b) only covers up to six people (adults) living together as a single household and receiving care. The care of children is generally excluded from Use Class C3(b).  Furthermore, insufficient information has been provided to demonstrate that the occupants would form a single household.  In addition, there are concerns regarding the intensification of use of the property, as there would be five residents and two carers. The proposed use would fall under Class C2 (Residential institutions) and would require separate planning consent.",

    "A refusal to issue a LDC is therefore not  necessarily conclusive that something is not lawful: it may merely mean that, so far, insufficient evidence has been presented to satisfy the LPA that the use, operation or activity is lawful."
