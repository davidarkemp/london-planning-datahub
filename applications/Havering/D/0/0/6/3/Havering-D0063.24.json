    "The proposed use would cater specifically for children which would not represent a C3(b) use, having regard to the definition of care at Article 2 of the UCO and the inability of children to form a household on their own.  Furthermore in the absence of sufficient evidence of the exact number (children, staff/carers, visitors), character and nature of the use, it cannot be concluded that the proposed use would not form a material change of use within the meaning of Section 55(1) of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990."
