    "The proposed occupation of the premises by two young adults 16+, one full time resident carer to run the household and two additional staff for the purposes of the care of those residents would not be materially removed from the use of the property as a single dwelling house if operated as described and it is considered that there would be no material change of use having regard to the Town and Country Planning (Use Classes) Order 1987 (as amended) as the use would remain within Class C3(a) of that Order.",
    "This certificate of lawfulness is issued on the basis of the use as described - \"Certificate of Lawfulness for the use of 9 Alan Gardens for the care of two residents aged 16+ with one live in carer and two additional staff members only\".",
    "It does not preclude against any action from being taken by the Council if it is later judged that a material change of use has occurred, should for example the intensity of the use go beyond what is described on the certificate issued or the character and nature of activities divulge from the supporting information submitted and the assessment made at this time."
