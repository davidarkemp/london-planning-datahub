  "description": "Certificate of Lawfulness for conversion of roof space to habitable use involving conversion of roof from hip to gable end with gable end windows to front and rear, and to include a side dormer and a side roof light. Front and side extension.",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposal fails to come within the provisions of Schedule 2, Part 1, Classes A, B and C of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015, as it doesn't accord with Class A (e) (i) as the enlarged part of the dwellinghouse extends beyond a wall which forms the principal elevation of the original dwellinghouse. The proposed loft conversion does not accord with Class B, including section (B1) (c) as the proposed hip to gable conversion at the front would go beyond the plane of the existing roof slope which forms the principal elevation of the dwellinghouse and fronts a highway. It does not accord with B.1 (d) as the total roof volume of the proposed extensions exceeds the original roof space by more than 50 cubic metres. The proposed external materials used for the side dormer do not accord with B.2 (a) as the materials are not a similar appearance to those used in the construction of the exterior of the existing dwellinghouse, as rendered blockwork",
    "It is noted that the drawing number 457-3-01-6 'Proposed Side Elevations' was in the superceded plans, but it appears to be the correct plan which was missing from the plans package and therefore was reinstated as a current plan.",
    "No proof has been provided to show that the 6m rear extension under Prior Approval has actually been constructed. Previous site photos and aerial imagery show that it has not been constructed. Recent site photos were requested of the agent via email but no response was received. If the 6m deep rear extension has not been constructed yet, then it would form part of the assessment of this Certificate of Lawfulness application."
