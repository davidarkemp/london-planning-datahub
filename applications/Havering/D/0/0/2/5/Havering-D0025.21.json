  "description": "Certificate of lawfulness for conversion of garage to habitable use, ancillary to the main use of the property as a dwelling",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The use of the garage as a guest room would be ancillary to the main dwelling and does not represent a material change of use of the property; building operations come within the provisions of Schedule 2, Part 1, Class A of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015, thereby not requiring planning permission.",
    "Development is permitted by Class A subject to the following conditions-",
    "(a) the materials used in any exterior work (other than materials used in the",
    "construction of a conservatory) shall be of a similar appearance to those used in the construction of the exterior of the existing dwellinghouse;",
    "(b) any upper-floor window located in a wall or roof slope forming a side elevation of the dwellinghouse shall be-",
    "(i) obscure-glazed, and",
    "(ii) non-opening unless the parts of the window which can be opened are more",
    "than 1.7 metres above the floor of the room in which the window is installed; and",
    "(c) where the enlarged part of the dwellinghouse has more than one storey, the roof pitch of the enlarged part shall, so far as practicable, be the same as the roof pitch of the original dwellinghouse.",
    "This certificate provides confirmation that the development is lawful.  You should also check whether the development requires separate Building Regulation consent. Information is available on the Building Control webpages via http://www.havering.gov.uk/Pages/Category/Building-control.aspx?l1=200252 and the team is available between 9am and 10am Monday to Friday via 01708 432700.",
    "Please note that this certificate is granted for the proposed conversion of the current garage to habitable space which is incidental to the main dwelling and not as a separate unit of accommodation.",
    "It must only be used for purposes incidental to the enjoyment of 9 Hill Grove, Romford, and not for any trade or business nor as separate living accommodation. Should business or permanent living accommodation use be intended, an application for full planning permission must be applied for and permission granted before such use could occur."
