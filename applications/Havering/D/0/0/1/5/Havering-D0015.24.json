Whilst the wall of the cart-lodge would appear to be removed from the flank wall of this building, the roof of the proposed cart-lodge would appear to adjoin the flank wall. In the absence of any evidence otherwise the structure would be more than four metres in height (e)(i) as a result. The proposed development is considered not to be in accordance with the provisions of Schedule 2, Part 1, Class E of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 2015."
