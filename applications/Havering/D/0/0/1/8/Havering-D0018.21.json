    "The operations do not fall within the provisions of Schedule 2, Part 1, Class E of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 2015, as amended. Specifically, given the overall size of the building, inclusion of kitchen facilities, size of cinema/games room and lack of detailed information in support of the application, on the balance of probabilities, the proposed annex is not considered to be incidental to the use of the original dwellinghouse.",
    "For Residential Development Only",
    "Please be advised that approval of this application from 1st September 2019 (either by London Borough of Havering, or subsequently by PINS if allowed on appeal following a refusal by London Borough of Havering) will attract a liability payment of £2,550 plus indexation in Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This charge has been levied under s.206 of the Planning Act 2008 and includes both the Mayor of London's CIL and Havering Council's CIL.",
    "London Borough of Havering, as CIL collecting authority, has responsibility for the collection of the Mayoral CIL, in addition to Havering's CIL, on commencement of the development.",
    "Your proposal is subject to a CIL Liability Notice indicating a levy of £43,950 plus indexation for the application, based on the Mayoral CIL levy rate for Havering of £25/sq.m plus Havering's charging rate for residential of £125/sq.m (Zone A), and the floorspace of 293 square metres.",
