    "The development is not permitted by Class B of Schedule 2, Part 1 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015, as the face and cheeks of the rear dormer window are not finished using materials that give a similar visual appearance to roof of the existing house. The materials used for dormer seem to match the painted render appearance of the rear elevation of the dwelling and therefore are not tiled to have the appearance and the similar colour and design used in the main roof of the house when viewed from ground level."
