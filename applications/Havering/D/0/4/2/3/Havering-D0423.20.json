    "practicable, not less than 0.2 metres from the eaves, measered along the roof slope from",
    "the outside edge of the eaves; and",

    "This certificate provides confirmation that the development is lawful.  You should also check whether the development requires separate Building Regulation consent. Information is available on the Building Control webpages via http://www.havering.gov.uk/Pages/Category/Building-control.aspx?l1=200252 and the team is available between 9am and 10am Monday to Friday via 01708 432700.",
    "The applicant is informed that this Certificate is valid for the existing dwelling. Please note that any other addition to the house, including the approved scheme for two storey rear extension (ref:P0729.20) before the completion of the loft extension would be likely to invalidate the Certificate. You are therefore advised the Certificate be built and not in combination with the rest of the works approved under this address, otherwise the Certificate already given would cease to apply which would require planning permission and is less likely to be supported."
