    "The proposed annexe would provide facilities required to be used independently of the main dwelling, and for a use which is considered to be a primary use and not an incidental use to the enjoyment of the dwellinghouse.  The proposal would not therefore fall within the provisions of Class E of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 2015, as amended, and constitutes development for which planning permission is required.",
    "The photos, plans and application form show that the outbuilding is 'existing' but the height of the outbuilding does not meet the criteria of Schedule 2, Part 1, Class E of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 as amended, in terms of its physical attributes, at as it is more than 2.5m in height (within 2 metres of the boundary of the curtilage).  It is unclear how long the outbuilding has been in place and if it has been in place more than the time period after which Planning Enforcement would intervene.  The retention of the existing out building would require planning permission, unless it is demonstrated through lawful use certificate that it has existed for the requisite time period."
