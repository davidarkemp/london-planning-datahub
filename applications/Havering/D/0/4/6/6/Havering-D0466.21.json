The proposed extended roof to the front of the dwellinghouse does not accord with Class A (A.1) (e) (i) as it would extend beyond a wall which forms the principal elevation of the original dwellinghouse. The proposed front porch does not accord with Class D (D.1) (c) as the highest part of the roof over the porch would exceed 3m above ground level, reaching up to 3.25m high where attached to the house. Therefore a Certificate of Lawfulness cannot be granted in this instance."
