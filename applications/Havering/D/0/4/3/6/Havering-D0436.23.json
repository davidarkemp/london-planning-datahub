    "The operations come within the provisions of Schedule 2, Part 1, Class B of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015, thereby not requiring planning permission.",

Information is available on the Building Control webpages and the team is available between 9am and 10am Monday to Friday via 01708 432700.",
    "The development is permitted by Class B subject to the following conditions-",
    "(a) the materials used in any exterior work must be of a similar appearance to those used",
    "in the construction of the exterior of the existing dwellinghouse;",
    "(b) the enlargement must be constructed so that-",
    "(i) other than in the case of a hip-to-gable enlargement or an enlargement which joins the original roof to the roof of a rear or side extension-",
    "(aa) the eaves of the original roof are maintained or reinstated; and",
    "(bb) the edge of the enlargement closest to the eaves of the original roof is, so far as",
    "practicable, not less than 0.2 metres from the eaves, measered along the roof slope from",
    "the outside edge of the eaves; and",
    "(ii) other than in the case of an enlargement which joins the original roof to the roof of a rear or side extension, no part of the enlargement extends beyond the outside face of any external wall of the original dwellinghouse; and",
    "(c) any window inserted on",
    "The applicant is reminded that planning permission was granted for a part two, part single storey rear extensions and single storey front/side extension under P1517.23. As part of this approval there is a proposed rear outrigger with a hipped roof above the eave height of the current dwelling. As such, if this is constructed prior to any works to the roof this would need to be included in the volume calculations and would mean this proposal would exceed 50cum and require planning permission.",
    "Conversely, if the works to complete the hip-to-gable and rear dormer are undertaken it would likely require a new planning application be submitted for the extensions approved under P1517.23 as the existing arrangement under which this was approved will have been altered."
