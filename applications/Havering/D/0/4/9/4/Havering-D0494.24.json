    "The proposed use of the application site as a children's home for a maximum of 3 children and a maximum of 6 people overall in the terms described in the application and additional information received would not result in a material change of use from the existing use as a Class C3 dwelling house, even though the proposed use in itself would fall within Use Class C2 of the Town and Country Planning (Use Classes Order) 1987 (as amended).  As such, the proposal does not constitute development and so planning permission is not required.",

    "Should the circumstances of the property/occupants and activities change it may be that planning permission would be required. It is the responsibility of the applicant to ensure that the operations associated with 19 Spencer Road",
