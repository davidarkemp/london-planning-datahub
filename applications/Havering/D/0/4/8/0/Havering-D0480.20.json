  "description": "Certificate of Lawfulness for erection of outbuilding to rear garden to be used for a gym/play area, home office and storage.  \n.",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The operations come within the provisions of Schedule 2, Part 1, Class E of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015, thereby not requiring planning permission.",
    "Please note that this certificate is granted for the outbuilding to be used as a gym/play area, home office and storage.",
    "It must only be used for purposes incidental to the enjoyment of 30 Brook Road, Gidea Park, Romford and not for any trade or business nor as living accommodation. Should business or living accommodation use be intended, an application for full planning permission must be applied for and permission granted before such use could occur. The use of outbuildings as living accommodation is not typically deemed acceptable therefore it is important the outbuilding is only used for the purposes as listed above.",
    "This certificate provides confirmation that the development is lawful.  You should also check whether the development requires separate Building Regulation consent. Information is available on the Building Control webpages via http://www.havering.gov.uk/Pages/Category/Building-control.aspx?l1=200252 and the team is available between 9am and 10am Monday to Friday via 01708 432700.",
    "The applicant should note that no part of the outbuilding should come within 2 metres of any of the three boundaries and this includes any fascia, guttering or overhanging roof. If this 2 metre gap is not retained this will invalidate the certificate of lawfulness and a planning application will be required."
