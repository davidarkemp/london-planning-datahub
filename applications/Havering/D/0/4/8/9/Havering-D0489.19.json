    "The Development (consisting of the re-cladding of two blocks (the 'turrets') of the school) would have met the restrictions, limitations and conditions of development granted planning permission by way of the relevant Schedules, Parts and Classes of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development)(England) Order 2015 [as amended] at the time of its construction. Consequently, the Development would have had planning permission if instituted or begun at the time of the application by virtue of section 59 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 [as amended], and consequently was lawful at the time of the application. Under the unambiguous wording of s192(2), officers recommend that the certificate of lawful development for the proposed development is granted.",
    "s192 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 [as amended] requires LPAs to seek more information if insufficient information has been provided to determine the lawfulness of the proposed works. In this instance, there was sufficient information provided and it was not deemed necessary or expedient to request more detail or further information from the applicant and / or their agent."
