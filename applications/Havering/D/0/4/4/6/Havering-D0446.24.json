    "The proposed porch would fail to comply with Class D as the overall height of the proposal would be more than 3m in height. The proposed porch would be an infill extension which would connect to the existing canopy roof which is a continuation of the main roof of the dwelling.",
    "The height the boundary treatment facing Curtis Road which is the street would be more than 1m in height and therefore would fail to comply with Schedule 2, Part 2, Minor Operations, Class A of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 1995, as amended and therefore a planning application would be required."
