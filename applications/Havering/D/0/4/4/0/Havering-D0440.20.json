    "The proposal fails to come within the provisions of Schedule 2, Part 1, Classes B and C of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015, as it doesn't accord with Class B1 (b) and Class C (c) as the proposed extensions exceed the height of the highest part of the existing roof and Class B1 (d) (ii) as the extensions to the roof exceed 50 cubic metres for a detached dwelling, therefore planning permission is required."
