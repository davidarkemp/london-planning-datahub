    "The proposed use would cater specifically for children and young adults (ages 8-18) which would not represent a C3(b) use, having regard to the definition of care at Article 2 of the UCO and the inability of children to form a household on their own.  Furthermore in the absence of sufficient evidence of the exact character and nature of the use, it cannot be concluded that the proposed use would not form a material change of use within the meaning of Section 55(1) of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990."
