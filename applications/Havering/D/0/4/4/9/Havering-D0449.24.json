    "In the absence of sufficient evidence about whether the occupants will form a single household, the proposed use is not considered to fall within Class C3(b) of the Use Classes Order (as amended). Furthermore, the host dwelling benefits from rear extension that is unlawful and requires planning permission. The Local Planning Authority considers that a Lawful Development Certificate cannot be issued for a proposal that would be reliant on a development that is unlawful. Therefore, planning permission is required for the proposed change of use from use class C3(a) dwellinghouse to C3(b) supported living to cover up to five people living together as a single household and receiving care."
