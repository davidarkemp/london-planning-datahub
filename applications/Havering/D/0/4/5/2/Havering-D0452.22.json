    "An application for a Certificate of Lawfulness under S.192 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 cannot be made in respect of works which have already been substantially completed on site.  Furthermore, the works that have been undertaken do not accord with the details shown on the drawings submitted with this application and appear to have been undertaken as a single building operation along with other extensions to the roof of the building.  As such, the Local Planning Authority is unable to assess the lawfulness of the works, as constructed, and the Certificate of lawfulness application must therefore be refused.",
