    "The proposed use on balance is not considered to conform to the requirements of C3(b), in so far as that there would be multiple family units with children present. Furthermore, given the number of occupiers proposed would be more than 6 at any one time, with no evidence of living together as a single household and the exact nature of care to be provided, it cannot be concluded that the proposed use would not form a material change of use within the meaning of Section 55(1) of the Town and Country Planning Act.",
    "The Council considers that bedroom 1, at approximately 10.93sq.m would not have adequate floor area for two occupancy, and the proposed use is more than likely to be C2, for which a full planning application would be required."
