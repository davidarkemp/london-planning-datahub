    "Insufficient evidence and justification as to the volume of the existing extended roof has been provided in order to be able to conclude that the proposal falls within the provisions of Schedule 2, Part 1, Class B of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015, thereby planning permission is required. In particular Paragraph B.3 requires that all previous additions to the existing roof be included in any resulting volume calculation. The roof of the previous extensions to the property plus the proposed enlargement would result in a volume greater than 50 cubic metres and therefore the proposal is not permitted development."
