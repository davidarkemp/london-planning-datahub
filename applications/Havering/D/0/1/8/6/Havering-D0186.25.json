    "Photographic evidence shows at least half the dwelling has been demolished, therefore the works proposed involve significant rebuilding, which goes beyond what could reasonably be considered as an enlargement, improvement or alteration of the dwelling and therefore would not comply with permitted development as outlined under Schedule 2, Part 1, Class A of The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 and the MHCLG Permitted development rights for householders Technical Guidance (September 2019).As a result, a planning application will be required for the proposal.",
    "The proposed hip to gable roof enlargement to the south side of the dwelling adjacent to the recreation ground would not be within the original dwelling house as it would be within a rebuilt section and therefore would fail to comply with  Schedule 2, Part 1, Classes B of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015. As a result, a planning application will be required for the proposal and to replace the side elevation of the original dwelling."
