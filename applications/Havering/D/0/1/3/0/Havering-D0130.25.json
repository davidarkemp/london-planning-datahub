    "The operations do not fall within the provisions of Schedule 2, Part 1, Class E of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 2015, as amended. Specifically, the roof of the outbuilding would come within 2m of the side and rear boundaries of the site. The MHCLG Permitted development rights for householders Technical Guidance September 2019 outlines under Class E (e) that if any part of the building, container or enclosure is within 2 metres of the boundary of the curtilage of the house, then the height limit for the total development is restricted to 2.5 metres if it is to be permitted development. The overall height is more than 2.5m at 4m and therefore planning consent is required.",
    "The operations do not fall within the provisions of Schedule 2, Part 1, Class E of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 2015, as amended. Specifically, that the outbuilding as indicated on the supporting statement PDS-25008 Revision: A will be used for an annexe which is considered not to be incidental to the main dwelling house. Planning permission is required for the construction of annexe within the site and for this reason, it is recommended that a planning application would be required for the proposed outbuilding."
