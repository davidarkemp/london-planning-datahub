    "The proposal fails to come within the provisions of Schedule 2, Part 1, Class B of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015, thereby planning permission is required as it goes against section (B1) (d) and (B2 (a). The proposed hip to gable conversion and rear dormer added to the existing extensions would amount to more than 50 cubic metres of additional roof space to the original house and therefore exceed the limit allowed under Permitted Development rights. The proposed materials for the side of the dormer to be a render finish don't match the existing roof which uses roof tiles."
