Information is available on the Building Control webpages via http://www.havering.gov.uk/Pages/Category/Building-control.aspx?l1=200252 and the team is available between 9am and 10am Monday to Friday via 01708 432700.",
    "This planning permission does not remove the need to obtain any separate consent of the owner of the adjoining property prior to commencing building works on, under, above or immediately adjacent to their property (e.g. foundations or guttering). The Party Wall Etc. Act 1996 contains requirements to serve notice on adjoining owners of property under certain circumstances, and a procedure exists for resolving disputes. This is a matter of civil law between the two parties, and the Local Planning Authority are not involved in such matters.",

    "Please note that this certificate is granted for the outbuilding to be used only for purposes incidental to the enjoyment of Upweys, Fen Lane and not for any trade or business nor as living accommodation. Should business or living accommodation use be intended, an application for full planning permission must be applied for and permission granted before such use could occur. The use of outbuildings as living accommodation is not typically deemed acceptable therefore it is important the outbuilding is only used for the purposes as listed above."
