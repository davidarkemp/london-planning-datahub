    "The proposed use on balance is not considered to conform to the requirements of C3(b), in so far as there would be multiple family units with children present. Furthermore, there is no evidence of both families living together as a single household, therefore, it cannot be concluded that the proposed use would not form a material change of use within the meaning of Section 55(1) of the Town and Country Planning Act.",
    "The Council considers that the proposed use is more than likely to be C2, for which a full planning application would be required."
