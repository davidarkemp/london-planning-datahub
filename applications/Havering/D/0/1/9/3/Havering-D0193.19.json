As such the proposed development is considered to be contrary to the provisions of Schedule 2, Part 1, Class B of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 2015, as amended, and it is therefore recommended that a Certificate of Lawfulness for the proposed development be refused in this instance."
