Information is available on the Building Control webpages and the team is available between 9am and 10am Monday to Friday via 01708 432700.",

Should business or living accommodation use be intended, an application for full planning permission must be applied for and permission granted before such use could occur. The use of outbuildings as living accommodation is not typically deemed acceptable therefore it is important the outbuilding is only used for the purposes as listed above."
