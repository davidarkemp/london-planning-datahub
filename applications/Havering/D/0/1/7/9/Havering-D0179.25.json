    "The proposal fails to provide adequate information to show that it would fall within class C3(b) which covers up to six people living together as a single household, including where care is provided for residents.   Insufficient information has been provided to demonstrate that the occupants would form a single household engaging in a range of communal activities; the age range of the occupants has not been provided, the level of needs of the occupants has not been provided and details of the level of care, number of carers, shift patterns has not been provided.  Consequently the proposal fails to demonstrate the lawfulness of the use proposed and a Certificate cannot be issued."
