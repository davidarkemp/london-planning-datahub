    "The operations come within the provisions of Schedule 2, Part 1, Class E of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015, thereby not requiring planning permission.",
    "Lawful Development Certificate Outbuilding Informative",
    "Please note that this certificate is granted for the outbuilding to be used as a gym/study as shown on drawing no. S04 Rev P2.  It must only be used for purposes incidental to the enjoyment of 43 Macdonald Avenue, Hornchurch and not for any trade or business nor as living accommodation. Should business or living accommodation use be intended, an application for full planning permission must be applied for and permission granted before such use could occur. The use of outbuildings as living accommodation is not typically deemed acceptable therefore it is important the outbuilding is only used for the purposes as listed above.",
