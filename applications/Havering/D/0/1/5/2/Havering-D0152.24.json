    "The cumulative width of the proposed single storey side extension would have a width greater than half the width of the original dwelling house and the original garage. The existing garage has been extended to the rear. Therefore the proposal would not comply with permitted development as outlined under Schedule 2, Part 1, Class A of The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 and the MHCLG Permitted development rights for householders Technical Guidance (September 2019).",
    "The application dwelling would have more than one eaves, as the garage would have a lower eaves line than the application dwelling. The proposed side extension would have a flat roof which would be higher than the existing flat roof garage. As a result, the proposal would not comply with permitted development as outlined under Schedule 2, Part 1, Class A of The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 and the MHCLG Permitted development rights for householders Technical Guidance (September 2019)."
