    "Permitted Development within the curtilage of the dwellinghouse and relating to the enlargement, improvement or other alterations have been removed when permission was originally granted for the development of the residential units L/HAV/852/82. The property does therefore not benefit from Permitted Development Rights under Part 1 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development)(Amendment)(No.2)(England) Order 2015. Further, conditions attached to the planning permissions cited restrict the use of the garage for living accommodation. The development proposed therefore requires planning permission."
