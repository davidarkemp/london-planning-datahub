  "site_name": "3 Collingwood Road",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "In the absence of sufficient information about whether the occupants will form a single household, the proposed use is not considered to be demonstrated to fall within Class C3(b) of the Use Classes Order (as amended) and based on the information available the layout and use of the premises is likely to give rise to a material change of use of the property. Furthermore, the application would be reliant on a garage conversion that is unlawful (by virtue of condition 8 of planning permission P0605.98 dated 16/06/1999) and as such, requires planning permission. For this reason, the applicant has failed to demonstrate that the proposed use of the property would be lawful and the Certificate is therefore refused.",
    "The applicant should note that a side extension set flush with the front wall of the dwellinghouse at first floor level would not be in accordance with the plans approved for a side extension as part of P0112.05 and therefore would require planning permission."
