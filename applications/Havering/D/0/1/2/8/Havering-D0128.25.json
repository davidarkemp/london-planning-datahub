    "The operations come within the provisions of Schedule 2, Part 1, Class A of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015, thereby not requiring planning permission.",
    "Development is permitted by Class A subject to the following conditions-",
    "(a) the materials used in any exterior work (other than materials used in the",
    "construction of a conservatory) shall be of a similar appearance to those used in the construction of the exterior of the existing dwellinghouse;",
    "(b) any upper-floor window located in a wall or roof slope forming a side elevation of the dwellinghouse shall be-",
    "(i) obscure-glazed, and",
    "(ii) non-opening unless the parts of the window which can be opened are more",
    "than 1.7 metres above the floor of the room in which the window is installed; and",
    "(c) where the enlarged part of the dwellinghouse has more than one storey, the roof pitch of the enlarged part shall, so far as practicable, be the same as the roof pitch of the original dwellinghouse.",
    "This certificate provides confirmation that the development is lawful.  You should also check whether the development requires separate Building Regulation consent. Information is available on the Building Control webpages and the team is available between 9am and 10am Monday to Friday via 01708 432700.",
    "This planning permission does not remove the need to obtain any separate consent of the owner of the adjoining property prior to commencing building works on, under, above or immediately adjacent to their property (e.g. foundations or guttering). The Party Wall Etc. Act 1996 contains requirements to serve notice on adjoining owners of property under certain circumstances, and a procedure exists for resolving disputes. This is a matter of civil law between the two parties, and the Local Planning Authority are not involved in such matters.",
