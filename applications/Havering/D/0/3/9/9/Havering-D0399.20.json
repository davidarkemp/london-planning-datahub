  "description": "Certificate of lawfulness for the erection of single storey outbuilding to be used for study/office space, games room and garden store with the demolition of the existing outbuilding.",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The operations come within the provisions of Schedule 2, Part 1, Class E of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015, thereby not requiring planning permission.",
    "Please note that this certificate is granted for the outbuilding to be used for a study/office space, games room and garden store. It must only be used for purposes incidental to the enjoyment of 153 Hillview Avenue, Hornchurch and not for any trade or business nor as living accommodation. Should business or living accommodation use be intended, an application for full planning permission must be applied for and permission granted before such use could occur. The use of outbuildings as living accommodation is not typically deemed acceptable therefore it is important the outbuilding is only used for the purposes as listed above.",
    "The applicant is advised that the details shown on the submitted drawings indicate that ground levels within the site are flat.  If conditions on site deviate from this or any changes in ground levels take place to accommodate the proposed outbuilding then this may result in it exceeding the maximum height limitation and consequently planning permission would then be required.",
    "This certificate provides confirmation that the development is lawful.  You should also check whether the development requires separate Building Regulation consent. Information is available on the Building Control webpages via http://www.havering.gov.uk/Pages/Category/Building-control.aspx?l1=200252 and the team is available between 9am and 10am Monday to Friday via 01708 432700."
