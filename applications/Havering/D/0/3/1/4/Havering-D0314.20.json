    "(a) the materials used in any exterior work (other than materials used in the",
    "construction of a conservatory) shall be of a similar appearance to those used in the construction of the exterior of the existing dwellinghouse;",
    "(b) any upper-floor window located in a wall or roof slope forming a side elevation of the dwellinghouse shall be-",
    "(i) obscure-glazed, and",
    "(ii) non-opening unless the parts of the window which can be opened are more",
    "than 1.7 metres above the floor of the room in which the window is installed; and",
    "(c) where the enlarged part of the dwellinghouse has more than one storey, the roof pitch of the enlarged part shall, so far as practicable, be the same as the roof pitch of the original dwellinghouse.",
    "Your attention is drawn to Prior Approval Application reference Y0262.20 dated 29th September 202 with eaves height of 2.9m. The proposed eaves height is higher than the eaves height of the original bungalow, and as such would, according to facts and degree, not be permitted development, which if built, constitutes a breach of planning control requiring planning permission."
