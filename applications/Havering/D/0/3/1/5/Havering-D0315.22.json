    "The operations do not come within the provisions of Schedule 2, Part 1, Class A of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 2015, as amended. Specifically, the enlarge part of the dwellinghouse would be within 2 metres of the boundary of the curtilage of the dwellinghouse, and the height of the eaves of the enlarged part would exceed 3 metres. In this regard the land (shared access) between the application property and 22 Grays Gardens is not curtilage because it is not attached to the dwelling forming one enclosure with it and the building."
