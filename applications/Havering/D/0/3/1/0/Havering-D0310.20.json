    "Please note that this certificate is granted for the outbuilding to be used only for purposes incidental to the enjoyment of 10 Eyre Close, (i.e. garage use) and not for any trade or business nor as living accommodation. Should business or living accommodation use be intended, an application for full planning permission must be applied for and permission granted before such use could occur. The use of outbuildings as living accommodation is not typically deemed acceptable therefore it is important the outbuilding is only used for the purposes as listed above."
