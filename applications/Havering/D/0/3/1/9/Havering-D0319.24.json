    "Class C3(b) only covers up to six people (adults) living together as a single household and receiving care. The care of children is excluded from Use Class C3(b). In addition, there are concerns regarding the intensification of use of the property, as there would be three children and four carers on site at any one time excluding and other visitors. Based on the information submitted with the application, the proposed use would fall under Class C2 (Residential institutions) and would give rise to a material change of use for which planning permission is required."
