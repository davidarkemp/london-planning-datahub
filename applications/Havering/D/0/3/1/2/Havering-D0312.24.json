    "The operations do not fall within the provisions of Schedule 2, Part 1, Class E of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 2015, as amended. Specifically, the outbuilding would be higher than 2.5m and within 2m of the site boundaries and the proposal fails to comply with the permitted development criteria.",
    "The Local Planning Authority is not satisfied that the operations fall within the provisions of Schedule 2, Part 1, Class E of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 2015, as amended. Specifically, the use of part of the proposed outbuilding is not shown and insufficient evidence is provided that the outbuilding would be ancillary to the main dwelling.",
    "Site photos provided by the applicant show an outbuilding is already in place on the site.  It is unknown if the outbuilding correlates with the submitted plans.  It should be noted that a 'proposed' lawful development certificate was applied for where's an 'existing' lawful development certificate was likely to be required. In the event that the existing outbuilding reflects the dimensions depicted on the drawings, a planning application would be required for its retention."
