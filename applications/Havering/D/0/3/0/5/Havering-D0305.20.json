    "The proposal development does not accord with the provisions of Schedule 2, Part 1, Class A of The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015, as the proposed two storey rear extension is within 2m of the boundary of the curtilage of the dwellinghouse and have an eaves height above 3m and it would alter a part of the roof of the dwellinghouse. Therefore a Certificate of Lawfulness cannot be granted in this instance."
