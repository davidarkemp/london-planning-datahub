As such it is not considered that the totality of the proposed outbuilding is genuinely and reasonably required to achieve the purpose of accommodating incidental activities. The proposed development is not considered to be in accordance with the provisions of Schedule 2, Part 1, Class E of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 2015."
