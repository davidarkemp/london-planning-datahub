    "This Certificate only confirms that the proposed extension, as shown on drawing no. 19031_PA12 (dated July 2019), was lawful as of the date of the application on 28 August 2019.  It is noted however that a single storey rear extension has recently been constructed post-submission of this application at the rear of the building.  This Certificate does not confirm whether the existing extension that has been constructed is lawful or not.  To confirm this, an application for a Lawful Development Certificate for an Existing use or operation or activity including those in breach of a planning condition, should be submitted."
