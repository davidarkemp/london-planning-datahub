    "The proposed use is not considered to conform to the requirements of C3(b) because individual residents would recieve personal care from staff meaning that they would not form part of a single household. Furthermore, in the absence of sufficient evidence about how long residents would stay at the premises, it cannot be concluded that the proposed use of the property would fall within Class C3(b) of the Town and Country Planning (Use Classes) Order 1987 (as amended). The proposal therefore requires planning permission."
