  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposal fails to come within the provisions of Schedule 2, Part 1, Class B of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015, as it doesn't accord with (B1) (c) as the proposed hip to gable conversion at the front would go beyond the plane of the existing roof slope which forms the principal elevation of the dwellinghouse and fronts a highway and it would not accord with (B2) (c) as the proposed roof lights to the roof slope of a side elevation are not shown as obscure glazed and the proposed windows to the side dormers are shown to be openable below 1.7m above the floor of the room in which the windows are installed, therefore planning permission is required."
