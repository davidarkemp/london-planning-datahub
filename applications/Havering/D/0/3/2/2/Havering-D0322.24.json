    "The depth of the proposed single storey rear extension would be in excess of 3m in depth as under Schedule 2, Part 1, Class A of The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 and the MHCLG Permitted development rights for householders Technical Guidance (September 2019). It is noted that no prior approval householder application was submitted prior to the submission of the this certificate of lawfulness application. Mindful that works have commenced on site, a retrospective householder planning application will be required for the single storey rear extension.",
    "The proposal is not permitted development due to the proposed extension being more than half the width of the original dwelling (where there is a staggered original rear wall or where the proposal extends beyond the rear wall).  Even with the intent to demolish the furthest forward rear wall (bay window), case law advises that the 'original' rear wall is the element to be taken into consideration and therefore the proposal requires planning consent.",
    "Certificate of Lawfulness Informative",
    "The applicant should note that any works undertaken without the relevant consent is done so at their own risk and may be liable to enforcement action. The proposal has been referred to Planning Enforcement to investigate further."
