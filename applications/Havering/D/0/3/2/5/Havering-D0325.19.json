    "A building of this size and described use is not considered to constitute an ancillary outbuilding or one that is incidental to the use of the dwellinghouse. The proposed outbuilding would be a large, detached building which could be used as habitable accommodation. The applicant has not demonstrated that the proposed building is required for purposes incidental to the enjoyment of the dwelling house. The proposed development cannot therefore be considered compliant with regulation E(a) and condition E.4 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (Schedule 2, Part 1, Class E) which states that it must be 'incidental to the enjoyment of the dwellinghouse'."
