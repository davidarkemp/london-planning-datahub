    "The rear dormer, by reason of its proposed materials (zinc cladding) would, by reason of the inappropriateness of the materials and in combination with the bulk, scale and mass of the dormer, appear as an incongruous and visually intrusive form of development that would cause harm to the rear garden scene, contrary to the Residential Extensions and Alterations and Supplementary Planning Document and Policies 7 and 26 of the Local Plan.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to the agent (Mr Dalton) by e-mail.",
    "Additions or alterations to the roof space of properties are permitted under Class B of the General Permitted Development Order (2015) subject to certain conditions. One such condition is that the materials used in any exterior work should be of a similar appearance to those used in the construction of the exterior of the existing dwellinghouse. Staff note that the plans submitted for D0537.20 state that \"all sides of the proposed rear dormer would be clad with tiles matching those of the roof of the dwelling\". As such, if the rear dormer is not finished in materials which are of a similar appearance to those used in the construction of the roof of the host dwelling, it would no longer constitute  permitted development and planning permission would be required for the development as a whole."
