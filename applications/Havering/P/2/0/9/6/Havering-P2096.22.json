    "The proposed front extension and two storey side / rear extension would, by reason of their poor design, height and bulk appear as an unacceptably dominant and visually intrusive feature in the streetscene and rear garden environment detrimental to the visual amenity of the locality contrary to Policy 26 of the Havering Local Plan adopted 2021.",
    "The proposed two storey side / rear extension would, by reason of its poor design, height, bulk and proximity to the shared boundary with no.161, have an overbearing impact, loss of outlook and an increased sense of enclosure to the detriment of the amenity of the occupiers of no.161 contrary to Policy 7 of the Havering Local Plan adopted 2021.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: In accordance with paragraph 38 of the National Planning Policy Framework, improvements required to make the proposal acceptable were negotiated with Abdur Chowdhury via email on 14.2.23.  The revisions involved reducing the width of the first floor rear extension, increasing the set back of the first floor side extension, the removal of the 2-storey front extension and the redesign of the roof.  The applicant declined to make the suggested revisions."
