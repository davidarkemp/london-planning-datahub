    "The proposed development would, by reason of its excessive scale, bulk, height, design and cramped layout appear as an unacceptably dominant, oppressive and visually intrusive feature when viewed from the front streetscene, nearby gardens and dwellings and be detrimental to visual amenity and to the character and appearance of the surrounding area contrary to Local Plan Policy 26.",
    "The proposed layout and design of the development together with the position of the front forecourt parking, absence of vehicular visibility splays and the proposed location of the refuse store would create an obstructive and cramped layout and would fail to provide safe, inclusive, accessible and fit for purpose access to the development for future residents contrary to policies 10, 23, 26, 27 and 35 of the Local Plan, policies D4, D5, D6, D7, D11, T2 and T4 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "The proposed development would result unacceptable overlooking (particularly to No.s 3 and 5 Prestwood Drive), loss of outlook (particularly from No. 6 Clitheroe Road and No.s 3 and 5 Prestwood Drive) and overshadowing the rear gardens of No's 3 and 5 Prestwood Drive to the detriment of the residential amenity of neighbouring occupiers contrary to Local Plan Policy 7.",
    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority that adequate cycle storage could feasibly be accommodated on-site. The proposed development is therefore contrary to Local Plan policy 23 and London Plan (2021) policy T5.",
    "In the absence of sufficient information it has not been demonstrated that the proposed dwelling would achieve a minimum floor to ceiling height of 2.5m for at least 75 per cent of their Gross Internal Area and would fail to provide a good standard of accommodation for future occupiers contrary to Local Plan Policy 7 and London Plan policy D6.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to the Agent by email on the 19/01/2022.",
    "The proposal, if granted planning permission on appeal, would be liable for LB Havering CIL and will incur a charge of £13,375 (subject to indexation) based on the calculation of £125.00 per square metre. The proposal is also liable for Mayoral CIL and will incur a charge of £2,675 (subject to indexation) based on the calculation of £25.00 per square metre.",
