    "The proposed development would, by reason of its design, bulk, and mass, appear as an incongurous development which would be an unacceptably dominant and visually intrusive feature in the streetscene. This would harm the appearance of the surrounding area, being contrary to Policy 26 of the local plan, the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document, and the London Plan 2021. In addition, due to its design, bulk and proximity to the shared boundary, the development would cause an overbearing impact and increased sense of enclosure, to the detriment of the amenity enjoyed by the occupiers of nos. 7 The Drive, and 53 Lawns Way, contrary to Policy 7 of the Havering Local Plan.",
