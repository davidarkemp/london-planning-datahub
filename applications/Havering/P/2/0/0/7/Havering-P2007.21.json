    "The proposed rear extension would, by reason of its excessive depth, height and position close to the boundaries of the site, be an intrusive and unneighbourly development as well as having an adverse effect on the amenities of adjacent occupiers and appear as an unacceptably dominant and visually intrusive feature in the terrace harmful to the appearance of the surrounding area contrary to Policies 7 and 26 of the Local Plan.",
    "In the absence of sufficient details of the proposed Class E(f) use and details of mitigation measures including a detailed management plan to overcome concerns regarding noise the application fails to demonstrate that the proposed use would not result in a loss of amenity for surrounding residential occupiers contrary to Local Plan policy 7 and 34 and London Plan policy D14.",
