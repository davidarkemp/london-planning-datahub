    "The proposal fails to meet the minimum gross internal floor area resulting in poor standard of accommodation. Further in the absence of sufficient information it has not been demonstrated that the proposed dwelling would achieve the minimum floor to ceiling height of 2.5m for at least 75 per cent of their Gross Internal Area and therefore the proposal would provide substandard accommodation detrimental to amenities of the future occupiers of the site contrary to Local Plan Policy 7 and London Plan policy D6.",
    "The proposed development would by reason of its design, form and massing and the relationship with No5 Retford Path would result in a discordant building form and cramped form of development, would be unacceptable and uncharacteristic for the surrounding area, and would adversely impact the character and appearance of the locality and the established pattern of development, contrary to the high-quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policies D3 and D4 of The London Plan (2021) and Policies 7 and 26 of the Local Plan.",
    "The proposed development by reason of its bulk and mass and close relationship to the shared boundary with No5 Retford Path would result in an overbearing impact to the detriment of their amenity and the enjoyment of the rear garden environment of No5 Retford Path contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policies D3 and D4 of The London Plan (2021) and Policies 7, 10 and 26 of the Local Plan",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to Mr Ghafar (agent) by email dated 10/03/23.",
    "The proposal, if granted planning permission on appeal, would be liable for the Mayor of London and Havering Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). Based upon the information supplied with the application, the Mayoral CIL payable would be £670 based on the calculation of £25.00 per square metre and the Havering Community Infrastructure Levy (HCIL) would be a charge of £3370 based on calculation of £125.76 per square metre. Each would be subject to indexation.",
    "Further details with regard to CIL are available from the Council's website."
