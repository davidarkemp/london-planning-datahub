    "The proposed development would fail to make provision for the minimum requirement of one three bedroom family unit required in conversions and subdivisions as set out within Policy 9 of the Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 and is therefore unacceptable in principle.",
    "The proposed development would fail to demonstrate an acceptable living environment for future occupants, through shortfalls in prescribed standards for amenity space, factors which are conducive to a cramped overdevelopment of the site which would be detrimental to the amenity of future occupiers. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy 7 of the Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 and London Plan 2021 Policy D6. There would also be conflict with paragraph 130(f) of the National Planning Policy Framework which seeks to ensure a high standard of amenity for future users of development.",
    "The development would create an uplift in occupancy and intensive use of areas of the site which would be out of keeping with the surrounding suburban context and not comparable to the historic use of the site. This would present in increased comings and goings to the site which would be over and above what could be regarded as acceptable and would be detrimental to local character and the amenity of adjoining and nearby occupiers. The development would be both detrimental to local character and the amenity of nearby occupiers contrary to Policies 7, 9, 26 and 34 of the Havering Local Plan 2016-2031.",
    "The applicant has not demonstrated satisfactorily that the car parking layout is sufficiently well removed from the earlier refusal and in a manner which would allow sufficient visibility for emerging vehicles. The proposed development would, by reason of the inadequate sightlines be detrimental to the safety of other road users and pedestrians. As such the proposals do not make adequate provision for off-street parking and would be contrary to Policies 9, 23 and 24 of the Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 and London Plan 2021 Policy T6.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to the agent in writing 14-12-2021.",
    "In the event that this application is allowed through the appeals process the proposals would be liable for the following CIL contributions:",
    "The proposals would incur a Mayoral CIL contribution of £6,947.50 at a rate of £25 per sqm (277.9m² x 25).",
    "The proposal is also liable for the Havering Community Infrastructure Levy (HCIL), which has a charging rate of £125 per square metre of net additional floor space in Zone A. The Havering Community Infrastructure Levy contribution would equate to £34,737.50",
    "Each contribution would be subject to indexation."
