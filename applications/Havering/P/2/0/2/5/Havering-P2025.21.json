    "The development to which this permission relates must be commenced not later than three years from the date of this permission.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To comply with the requirements of Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended by Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004).",
    "The development hereby permitted shall not be carried out otherwise than in complete accordance with the approved plans (as set out on page one of this decision notice).",
    "Reason:-",
    "For the avoidance of doubt and to ensure that the development is carried out as approved.",
    "The proposed development hereby approved shall be constructed in accordance with the materials detailed under Section 14 of the application form unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason: To ensure that the appearance of the proposed development will harmonise with the character of the surrounding area and comply with Policy 26 of the Local Plan.",
    "No demolition or above ground works shall take place in relation to any of the development hereby approved until a Construction Method Statement to control the adverse impact of the development on the amenity of the public and nearby occupiers is submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority. The Construction Method statement shall include details of:",
    "a)  parking of vehicles of site personnel and visitors;",
    "b)  storage of plant and materials;",
    "c)  dust management controls;",
    "d)  measures for minimising the impact of noise and ,if appropriate, vibration arising from construction activities;",
    "e)  predicted noise and, if appropriate, vibration levels for construction using methodologies and at points agreed with the Local Planning Authority;",
    "f)  scheme for monitoring noise and if appropriate, vibration levels using methodologies and at points agreed with the Local Planning Authorities;",
    "g)  siting and design of temporary buildings;",
    "h)  scheme for security fencing/hoardin",
    "All building operations in connection with the construction of external walls, roof, and foundations; site excavation or other external site works; works involving the use of plant or machinery; the erection of scaffolding; the delivery of materials; the removal of materials and spoil from the site, and the playing of amplified music shall only take place between the hours of 8.00am and 6.00pm Monday to Friday, and between 8.00am and 1.00pm on Saturdays and not at all on Sundays and Bank Holidays/Public Holidays.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To protect residential amenity, and in order that the development accords with Local Plan Policy 34.",
    "No occupation of the new dwelling shall take place in relation to any of the development hereby approved until there has been submitted to and approved by the Local Planning Authority a scheme of hard and soft landscaping, which shall include indications of all existing trees and shrubs on the site, details of any to be retained, together with measures for the protection in the course of development and details of the removal of the existing hard landscaping within the front garden to be replaced with soft landscaping to improve biodiversity within the site. All planting, seeding or turfing comprised within the scheme shall be carried out in the first planting season following completion of the development and any trees or plants which within a period of 5 years from completion of the development die, are removed or become seriously damaged or diseased shall be replaced in the next planting season with others of a similar size and species, unless otherwise agreed in writing by the loca",
    "The new dwellings hereby approved shall be designed to ensure that the internal water consumption does not exceed a maximum of 105 litres per day to comply with London Plan policy SI5 and Regulation 36 (2)(b) and Part G2 of the Building Regulations - Water Efficiency.",
    "Reason: In order to comply with Policy SI 5 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "All hard surfaces hereby approved as part of the development (including any sub-base) shall be made of porous materials or provision shall be made to direct run-off water from the hard surface to a permeable or porous area or surface within the curtilage of the application site.",

    "No above ground works shall take place in relation to any of the development hereby approved until details of surface water drainage works are submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority.  Surface water drainage shall be provided in accordance with the approved details.",
    "Reason:-",
    "Surface water drainage works are required on site to prevent the risk of flooding.  Submission of a scheme prior to commencement will ensure that the measures to be employed are technically sound and that the development accords with Local Plan Policy 32 and London Plan (2021) policy SI 12.",
    "Prior to above ground works commencing of the development hereby approved, details of all proposed walls, fences, including front garden boundary treatments and details to remove the front vehicular access shall be submitted to, and approved in writing by, the Local Planning Authority. The development shall then be carried out in accordance with the approved details and retained permanently thereafter to the satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:",
    "Insufficient information has been supplied with the application to judge the appropriateness of any boundary treatment.  Submission of this detail prior to commencement will protect the visual amenities of the development, prevent undue overlooking of adjoining property and ensure that the development accords with Local Plan policies 7, 26 and 27.",
    "No building shall be occupied or use commenced until screen fencing between the dwellings rear gardens and low level fencing between the front gardens of the dwellings is provided in accordance with details previously submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority. The fencing shall be permanently retained and maintained thereafter.",
    "Reason:-",
    "Insufficient information has been supplied with the application to judge the appropriateness of any boundary treatment.  Submission of this detail prior to occupation in the case of new building works or prior to the use commencing in the case of changes of use will protect the visual amenities of the development and prevent undue overlooking of adjoining property (Local Plan Policies 7 and 26).",
    "Notwithstanding the provisions of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015, no extension or enlargement (including porches and additions to roofs) shall be made to the dwellinghouse(s) hereby permitted, or any detached building erected, without the express permission in writing of the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:-",
    "In the interests of amenity and to enable the Local Planning Authority to retain control over future development, and in order that the development accords with Local Plan Policies 7 and 26.",
    "No building shall be occupied or use commenced until refuse and recycling facilities are provided in accordance with details which shall previously have been submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority. The refuse and recycling facilities shall be permanently retained thereafter.",
