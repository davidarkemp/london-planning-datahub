    "The proposed rear conservatory, when viewed cumulatively with the extension to the original building and two-storey side extension being implemented at the site would, by reason of overall bulk and amount of development, result in an overdevelopment of the site and therefore cause harm to its open vista, contrary to Local Plan Policy 26.",
    "The proposed re-allocation of car parking spaces and driveway to the front of the site would result in a visually intrusive feature within the street scene that would detract from the open character of the surrounding area, contrary to Local Plan Policy 26.",
    "The proposed re-allocation of car parking spaces to the front of the site would, by reason of its close proximity to the ground floor neighbouring window at no. 1 Carnforth Gardens, be an intrusive and unneighbourly development and that would have an adverse effect on the amenity of these adjacent occupiers, contrary to Local Plan Policy 7.",
    "The proposed vehicular crossover and re-allocation of car parking spaces and driveway to the front of the site would, by reason of their proximity close to the nearby junction, result in an unsatisfactory parking arrangement which would be detrimental to safety of pedestrians and other road users, contrary to Local Plan Policy 24 and Policy T6.1 of the London Plan 2021.",
