    "The proposal, by reason of poor outlook and light to the flats, particularly to the kitchens of all the flats and due to the fact that no dining rooms are provided, which would result in a poor quality living environment for future occupiers of the proposed development. In addition, flats 1 & 3 would overlook the garden of flat 2, which would result in undue overlooking and loss of privacy contrary to the provisions of Policy 7 of the Havering Local Plan, Policy D6 of the London Plan 2021 and also the guidance within the NPPF.",
    "The conversion and subdivision of the extended dwelling into three separate flats would result in the unacceptable loss of a much needed family home within the Borough and would not provide a minimum of one family unit of 3 or more bedrooms contrary to Policy 9 of the Havering Local Plan 2021.",
    "In the absence of a swept path analysis/tracking plans, the creation, siting and proximity of the car parking spaces for the proposed flats to the telegraph post and lamp post, would result in inadequate access and egress arrangements that would be harmful to highway and pedestrian safety and require the removal of a the telegraph post and lamp post contrary to Policies 23 and 24 of the Havering Local Plan and Policy T4 of the London Plan.",

This charge has been levied under s.206 of the Planning Act 2008 and includes both the Mayor of London's CIL and Havering Council's CIL.",
