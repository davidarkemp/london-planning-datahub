    "The proposed development would, by reason of its bulk, design, appearance and siting, fail to integrate acceptably with the host dwelling and would appear as an anomaly within the wider street scene. This development would be visually intrusive, and out of scale and character with the established building line and pattern of development in the surrounding environment. It is therefore harmful to the appearance of the site and surrounding area contrary to D1, D3 and D4 of The London Plan (2021), London Plan Housing SPG and Policies 3, 7 and 26 of the Council's Local Plan 2016 - 2031.",
    "The proposed development would, by reason of its site coverage, quantum of development, layout, scale and bulk, result in a cramped and incongruous form of development, be out of character with the prevailing pattern of development in the surrounding area to the detriment of the visual amenity of the locality contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policies D1, D3 and D4 of The London Plan (2021), London Plan Housing SPG and Policies 3, 7 and 26 of the Local Plan 2016 - 2031.",
    "In the absence of detailed contextual plans/elevations and a daylight and sunlight report to demonstrate otherwise, the proposed development would due to the constraints of the site in conjunction with the site coverage, siting, the proposed layout, scale, mass, height and design, would be an unneighbourly, overbearing and an oppressive development which would adversely impact on the residential amenity of the occupiers, no. 5 in particular, including loss of light, outlook, overbearing and adversely impact on their living conditions, contrary to policy D6 of The London Plan (2021), London Plan Housing SPG and Policies 3, 7 and 26 of the Local Plan 2016 - 2031.",
    "The proposed development would, by reason of its site coverage, in particular the narrow width and shallow north-facing rear garden; proximity to the rear boundary and limited separation distance from  the neighbouring substation  give rise to a cramped form of development which would materially harm the living conditions of future occupiers having particular regard to the provision of useable amenity space,  poor outlook and overbearing impact, which would be contrary to Policy D6 of The London Plan (2021), London Plan Housing SPG and Policies 3, 7 and 26 of the Local Plan 2016 - 2031.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, it was necessary to issue a decision as close to the statutory timeframe as possible as opposed to seeking amendments which would have significantly delayed the application.",
    "The proposal, if granted planning permission on appeal, would be liable for the Council and the Mayor of London Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). Based upon the information supplied with the application, the CIL payable would be £10,714. Further details with regard to CIL are available from the Council's website."
