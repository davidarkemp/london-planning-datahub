  "subdivision_of_building": "The application seeks retain the existing garage on the ground floor side elevation, but bringing the front face of the this forward to align with the main building line to the front. It is also proposed to rebuild the brick pier to the front to allow for a seamless junction from the existing to the proposed. The application also seeks to add a 1st floor with gabled roof with an inhabited space within the roof on top of the existing garage. The proposed extension 1st floor and gabled roof is designed so that the front face of the extension is set back from the existing building line as well as set back from the neighbouring 1st floor extension making it subservient to the surrounding buildings. The rear elevation of the proposed extension is as such as to not restrict the right for light from the neighbouring property’s 1st floor window whilst also allowing the appropriate head room for access from the existing staircase to the proposed study with the incorporation of a small dormer to the rear of the proposed extension. The proposed extension’s gabled roof is in keeping with the existing gabled roof to the property. The roof of the extension is slightly stepped due to the kink in the plan to allow for the right for light with the height of the proposed extension to be similar to that of the neighbouring 1st storey extension as to be cohesive with the existing street scape.\nThe proposed windows would be in keeping with the style of not just the existing dwelling house, but the street at large and the materials used would match those of the existing dwelling house, thus maintaining the relative symmetry and style of the street scene. \nThe existing site has rendered walls with brick coursing to the front elevation below the datum line of the front bay window as well as the full height of the brick pier to the front elevation see figure 3 below for more detail. The roof tiles are red clay with white framed windows to the front and rear of the house being double glazed Upvc. The proposed extension finishing materials will match the existing materials i.e. matching brickwork, render, red clay roof tiles and doubled glazed white framed double glazed Upvc windows. \nThere will be no windows located on the side elevation to avoid overlooking to the neighbouring property with the extension’s roof space having one number velux or similar rooflights to the rear to allow for natural light into this space as well as a window to the dormer of the proposed extension.
