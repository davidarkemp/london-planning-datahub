    "Reason:-",
    "To comply with the requirements of Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended by Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004).",
    "The development hereby permitted shall not be carried out otherwise than in complete accordance with the approved plans (as set out on page one of this decision notice).",
    "Reason:-",
    "For the avoidance of doubt and to ensure that the development is carried out as approved.",
    "The development shall not be commenced until samples of the materials to be used on the external finishes have been submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority. The development shall be implemented in accordance with the approved details and permanently maintained as such.",
    "Reason:-",
    "Insufficient information has been supplied with the application to judge the appropriateness of the external finishing materials to be used.  Submission of samples prior to commencement will safeguard the appearance of the premises and the character of the immediate area and will ensure that the development accords with the Council's Local Plan (2016 - 2031) Policy 26 and Policy 28.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35(2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management) Order 2015: No significant problems were identified during the consideration of the application, and therefore it has been determined in accordance with paragraph 38 of the National Planning Policy Framework."
