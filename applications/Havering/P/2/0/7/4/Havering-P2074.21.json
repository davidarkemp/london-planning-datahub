    "The proposed takeaway use, by reason of noise and disturbance caused by customers entering and leaving the premises, vehicles parking and manoeuvring, particularly during the evening hours of operation, would be detrimental to the amenities of the occupiers of nearby residential properties, contrary to Havering Local Plan Policies 7 and 34, and London Plan (2021) policies D3, D14 and T7.",
    "The proposed off-street parking arrangements and vehicular access would fail to safeguard the safety and comfort of pedestrians and cyclists and would be detrimental to traffic safety and increase road danger on New Road (A1306). The proposals would fail to provide sufficient room for turning on-site and be detrimental to the safe and efficient operation of buses on the A1306 contrary to Policies 23 and 24 of the Havering Local Plan, London Plan policies T3, T4 and T7 and paragraph 104 of the NPPF (2021).",
    "The proposal would introduce an incompatible use in a location designated for residential development prejudicing the delivery of high quality residential development within the wider Rainham and Beam Park Strategic Development Area and would also result in the net loss of residential floorspace on the site contrary to Local Plan Policies 2 and 3 and London Plan policies D3, SD1 and SD10.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to the Agent by email on the 17/12/21."
