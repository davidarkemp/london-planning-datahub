    "The proposed dwelling would, by reason of site coverage would result in cramming of the site and by reason of its roof and architectural design as well as absence of soft front landscaping, appear as an incongruous form of development along Stanley Road, out of character with the surrounding environment and established pattern of dwellings. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policies 7, 10 and 26 of the Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 and also Paragraph 130(a) of the NPPF which requires fundamentally that development add to the overall quality of the area whilst also establishing or maintaining a strong sense of place.",
    "The proposed development would fail to provide adequate provision of useable and functional external private amenity space for a 3-bedroom 6-person unit, something which together with ts limited floor-to-ceiling heights and storage space would result in a substandard residential accommodation of a low quality design that would be to the detriment of future occupants, contrary to the provisions of Policy D6 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy 7 of the Havering Local Plan 2016-2031.",
    "The proposed dwelling would, by reason of its proximity to the rear garden environment of no. 119 Abbs Cross Lane, cause overlooking and loss of privacy which would have a serious and adverse effect on the living conditions of these neighbouring occupiers, contrary to Policies 7 and 10 of the Havering Local Plan 2016-2031.",
    "In the event that this application is allowed through the appeals process, the proposals would be liable for the following CIL contributions:",
    "Mayoral CIL (MCIL2) contribution of £2,600 (x £25 per sqm).",
    "Havering CIL (HCIL) contribution of £13,000 (x £125 per sqm)",
    "Each contribution would be subject to indexation.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal was given to the agent via email on 15/05/2023."
