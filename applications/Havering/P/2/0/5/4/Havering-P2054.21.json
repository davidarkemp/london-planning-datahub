    "The proposed development by reason of its scale, bulk, mass and cumulative impact would appear as an unacceptably dominant and visually intrusive feature and unbalance the appearance of the pair of semi-detached bungalows within the street scene and rear garden environment and be harmful to the appearance of the surrounding area, contrary to the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document, policies D1, D3 and D4 of The London Plan (2021) and Policies 7 and 26 of the Local Plan.",
    "The proposed development, in particular the single storey rear extension by reason of its excessive depth and proximity to the boundary, would appear as an unacceptable dominant and visually intrusive feature in the rear garden surrounding scene and have an adverse effect on the amenity of the attached neighbour (No. 9 Shirley Gardens) contrary to the Supplementary Design Guidance (Residential Extensions and Alterations) and Policy 7 of the Local Plan.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, it was necessary to issue a decision as close to the statutory timeframe as possible as opposed to seeking amendments which would have significantly delayed the application."
