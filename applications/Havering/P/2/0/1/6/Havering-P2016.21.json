    "The provision of a first floor rear extension to an original Exhibition House would be detrimental to the architectural interest of the subject property through affecting the unbroken roofscape and would through its visibility adversely affect the character and appearance of the Conservation Area. As such the development would fail to preserve the character or appearance of the Gidea Park Conservation Area. The development would conflict with policies 26 and 28 of the Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 and the objectives of the NPPF. The development also fails to preserve or enhance the character and appearance of Gidea Park Conservation Area, therefore contrary to Section 72(1) of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990.",
    "Insufficient information has been provided to judge whether the removal of the chimney stack and replacement with fibreglass alternative would affect the architectural integrity and interest of the subject dwelling which, as an Exhibition House is a key consideration. As such and in the absence of evidence to the contrary the development would fail to preserve the character or appearance of the Gidea Park Conservation Area. The development would conflict with policies 26 and 28 of the Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 and the objectives of the NPPF. The development also fails to preserve or enhance the character and appearance of Gidea Park Conservation Area, therefore contrary to Section 72(1) of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990.",
