    "The development to which this permission relates must be commenced not later than three years from the date of this permission.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To comply with the requirements of Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended by Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004).",
    "The permission hereby granted shall be personal to Mr Ricky Phelan only, registered manager of St Benets House, 64 Wingletye Lane in connection with Children Assisted in a Real Environment Ltd and shall not enure for the benefit of the land or any other person.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To restrict the use of the premises to one compatible with the surrounding area and to enable the Local Planning Authority to exercise control over any future use not forming part of this application, to protect neighbouring amenity and in order that the development complies with Policy 16 of the Havering Local Plan 2016-2031.",
    "The development hereby permitted shall not be carried out otherwise than in complete accordance with the approved plans (as set out on page one of this decision notice).",
    "Reason:-",
    "For the avoidance of doubt and to ensure that the development is carried out as approved.",
    "Notwithstanding the provisions of the Town and Country Planning (Use Classes) Order 1987 (as amended) the use hereby permitted shall be for the provision of residential accommodation and care to people in need of care (C2) and shall be used for no other purpose(s) whatsoever including any other use within Class C2 of the Order, unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To restrict the use of the premises to one compatible with the surrounding area and to enable the Local Planning Authority to exercise control over any future use not forming part of this application and in order that the development complies with Policy 16 of the Havering Local Plan 2016-2031.",
    "The maximum number of residents occupying the premises hereby approved shall not exceed four at any one time disregarding staff.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To restrict the use of the premises to one compatible with the surrounding area and that the development accords with Policy 16 of the Havering Local Plan 2016-2031.",
    "Within three months of the date of this decision, details of cycle storage shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority. The cycle storage measures as agreed shall be implemented and retained for the lifetime of the development thereafter.",
    "Reason:-",
    "Insufficient information has been supplied with the application to demonstrate what facilities will be available for cycle parking.  Submission of this detail within three months of the date of this decision is in the interests of providing a wide range of facilities for non-motor car residents and sustainability.",
    "Within three months of the date of this decision, details of refuse and recycling facilities shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority. The refuse and recycling facilities as agreed shall be implemented and retained for the lifetime of the development thereafter.",
    "Reason:-",
    "Insufficient information has been supplied with the application to judge how refuse and recycling will be managed on site.  Submission of this detail within three months of the date of this decision will protect the amenity of occupiers of the development and also the locality generally.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35(2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management) Order 2015: No significant problems were identified during the consideration of the application, and therefore it has been determined in accordance with paragraph 38 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2019.",
    "A fee is required when submitting details pursuant to the discharge of conditions.  In order to comply with the Town and Country Planning (Fees for Applications, Deemed Applications, Requests and Site Visits) (England) Regulations 2012, (as amended), a fee of £116 per request or £34 where the related permission was for extending or altering a dwellinghouse, is needed."
