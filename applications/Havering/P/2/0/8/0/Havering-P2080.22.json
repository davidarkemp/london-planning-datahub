    "The proposed 3-storey gable rear extension would, by reason of its poor design, height, bulk and mass, appear as an unacceptably dominant and visually intrusive feature within the rear garden environment and harmful to the visual amenity of the surrounding area, contrary to Policy 7 and 26 of the Havering Local Plan adopted 2021.",
    "The proposed 2-storey side extension would, by reason of its excessive depth, scale and position close to the boundary of the site with no.18 Mill Park Avenue, be an intrusive and unneighbourly development as well as having an adverse effect on the amenities of adjacent occupiers due to its overbearing impact, loss of outlook and an increased sense of enclosure to the nearest first floor rear habitable room window, contrary to Policy 7 and 26 of the Havering Local Plan adopted 2021.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: In accordance with paragraph 38 of the National Planning Policy Framework, improvements required to make the proposal acceptable were negotiated with Mark Breden via email on 9.2.23.  The revisions involved the lowering of the height of the single storey extension to 3m, the removal of the 2-storey front extension and the redesign of the roof to the rear.  The applicant declined to make the suggested revisions.",
    "The proposal, if granted planning permission on appeal, would be liable for the Mayor of London and Havering Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). Based upon the information supplied with the application, the Mayoral CIL payable would be £5617.50 based on the calculation of £25.00 per square metre and the Havering Community Infrastructure Levy (HCIL) would be a charge of £28,087.50 based on calculation of £125 per square metre. Each would be subject to indexation.",
    "Further details with regard to CIL are available from the Council's website."
