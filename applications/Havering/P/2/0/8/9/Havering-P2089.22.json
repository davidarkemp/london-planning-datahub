    "The proposed southern facing side dormer window, by reason of its proximity to the neighbouring properties 13 and 14 Sudbury Close, would cause overlooking and loss of privacy which would have a serious and adverse effect on the living conditions of these neighbouring occupiers, contrary to Local Plan Policy 7 and the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document.",
