    "Reason: To safeguard the appearance of the premises and the character of the immediate area.",
    "The works hereby permitted shall be carried out strictly in accordance with the Construction Method Statement submitted to and agreed in writing with the Local Planning Authority under reference Q0221.21  to control the adverse impact of the development on the amenity of the public and nearby occupiers",
    "Reason:- To ensure the proposed development does not prejudice the amenities of occupiers of adjoining properties.",
    "The development hereby permitted shall not be carried out otherwise than in complete accordance with the approved plans (as set out on page one of this decision notice).",
    "Reason:-",
    "For the avoidance of doubt and to ensure that the development is carried out as approved.",
    "Prior to first occupation all fences, walls and boundary treatment forming part of the consented scheme as shown on drawing no. 103 and Material Schedule Revision 1 dated 06-01-2021 shall be installed and retained permanently thereafter to the satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority.",

They shall then be reatained permanently thereafter and waste presented at the boundary for collection on the relevant collection day.",
    "Reason:- To ensure that adequate facilities are retained for the lifetime of the development",
    "Notwithstanding the provisions of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015, no extension or enlargement (including additions to roofs) shall be made to the dwellinghouse(s) hereby permitted without the express permission in writing of the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:-",
    "In the interests of amenity and to enable the Local Planning Authority to retain control over future development.",
    "The proposed windows located in the front facing roof slopes on each dwelling hereby permitted shall be permanently glazed with obscure glass not less than Level 4 on the standard scale of obscurity and shall thereafter be maintained and permanently fixed shut.",

    "The dwellings hereby approved shall be constructed to comply with Part M4(2) of the Building Regulations - Accessible and Adaptable Dwellings.",
    "Reason: In the interests of amenity of future occupiers.",

    "Reason:-  To provide satisfactory off-street parking at the site",
    "Prior to the commencement of any works pursuant to this permission the developer shall submit for the written approval of the Local Planning Authority;",
    "a) A Phase I (Desktop Study) Report documenting the history of the site, its surrounding area and the likelihood of contaminant/s, their type and extent incorporating a Site Conceptual Model. (PLEASE NOTE THAT PART A WAS DISCHARGED UNDER REFERENCE Q0221.21), aplicant was advised to undertake site investigation, including gas monitoring over 6 month period.",
    "b) A Phase II (Site Investigation) Report if the Phase I Report confirms the possibility of a significant risk to any ensitive receptors.  This is an intrusive site investigation including factors such as chemical testing, quantitative risk assessment and a description of the sites ground conditions.  An updated Site Conceptual Model should be included showing all the potential pollutant linkages and an assessment of risk to identified receptors.",
    "c) A Phase III (Remediation Strate",
    "a) If, during development, contamination not previously identified is found to be present at the site then no further development (unless otherwise agreed in writing with the local planning authority) shall be carried out until a remediation strategy detailing how this unsuspected contamination shall be dealt with has been submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority. The remediation strategy shall be implemented as approved.",
    "b) Following completion of the remediation works as mentioned in (a) above, a 'Verification Report' must be submitted demonstrating that the works have been carried out satisfactorily and remediation targets have been achieved.",

    "Reason:-",
    "In order to ensure no water run-off from the hard surface which would contribute to risk of flooding.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35(2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management) Order 2015: No significant problems were identified during the consideration of the application, and therefore it has been determined in accordance with paragraph 38 of the National Planning Policy Framework.",
    "The proposed development would create a new floor area equivalent to  266sqm new gross internal floor space. The proposal is therefore liable for Mayoral CIL (MCIL2) and would incur a charge of £6,650 based on the calculation of £25.00 per square metre.",
    "In addition the development would be liable for the Havering Community Infrastructure Levy (HCIL) which was adopted on September 1st 2019. In this location it translates to a charge of £125 per sqm of new floor space. This equates to a charge of £33,250",
    "Each would be subject to indexation.",
    "The granting of planning permission does not discharge the applicant from responsibilities under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 the contravention of which is a criminal offence.",
    "Precautionary advice for birds",
    "Birds are legally protected during the breeding season and need to be considered in respect of any impact from the proposed work. Work involving vegetation clearance must take place outside the optimum breeding season (March to August inclusive), unless it can be confirmed there are no breeding birds in the proposed work area. Note that birds frequently nest outside of the optimum period, particularly during spells of milder weather. It should never be assumed work can always take place without prior investigation.",
    "Birds generally tend to nest in dense shrub beds and mature trees. Where such vegetation may be affected by the proposed work it will require inspection for nesting birds. For example, but not exclusively, blackbird, dunnock, robin, blue and great tit, pigeons, magpies and crows.",
    "When reinstating vegetation and hardstand following building, install permeable surfaces, water butts and rain gardens. Plant a diverse mix of trees, shrubs and her",
    "The developer is advised that if construction materials are proposed to be kept on the highway during construction works then they will need to apply for a license from the Council. If the developer requires scaffolding, hoarding or mobile cranes to be used on the highway, a license is required and Streetcare should be contacted on 01708434343 to make the necessary arrangements.",
    "Please note that unauthorised works on the highway is an offence."
