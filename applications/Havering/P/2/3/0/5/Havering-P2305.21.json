    "The proposal to convert the existing dwellinghouse with an original floorspace of less than 120sqm would be unacceptable in principle as it would result in the loss of a family sized dwelling and fail to re-provide a family sized home of where there is a recognised shortage of family accommodation in the Borough. As such, the proposal would result in the loss of a family sized home and would undermine the objective of ensuring mixed and balanced communities to meet current and future housing needs contrary to Local Plan policies 5 and 9.",
    "The proposal has failed to demonstrate that the proposed vehicular parking within the front forecourt would not increase road danger as parked vehicles would overhang the public highway which would be exacerbated given their proximity to the on-street/pavement parking bays located to the front of the site. Therefore in the absence of provision of adequate parking on-site, the proposal would result in an increase in demand for car parking on the surrounding streets, and in the absence of a car parking stress survey the application has failed to demonstrate that the increase in on-street car parking can be acceptably accommodated on surrounding highway network. The proposal is therefore contrary to contrary to Local Plan policies 9, 23 and 24 and London Plan policies T2 and T4",
    "The proposal would result in a first floor living room adjoining an upper floor bedroom within the adjoining dwelling of No. 20 Manser Road detrimental to the residential amenity of this property contrary to Local Plan policy 9 and London Plan policy D13.",
    "The first floor 1B2P flat (47sqm) would fall below the minimum internal floor space of 50sqm required to comply with table 3.1 of the London Plan and therefore would fail to provide an acceptable standard of accommodation for future occupiers of this unit contrary to Local Plan policy 7 and London Plan policy D6.",
