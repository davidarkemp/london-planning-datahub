    "The development to which this permission relates must be commenced not later than three years from the date of this permission.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To comply with the requirements of Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended by Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004).",
    "The development hereby permitted shall not be carried out otherwise than in complete accordance with the approved plans (as set out on page one of this decision notice).",
    "Reason:-",
    "For the avoidance of doubt and to ensure that the development is carried out as approved.",
    "Notwithstanding the provisions of the Town and Country Planning (Use Classes) Order 1987 (as amended) the use hereby permitted shall be for the provision of residential accommodation and care to people in need of care (C2) and shall be used for no other purpose(s) whatsoever including any other use within Class C2 of the Order, unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To restrict the use of the premises to one compatible with the surrounding area and to enable the Local Planning Authority to exercise control over any future use not forming part of this application and in order that the development complies with Policy 16 of the Havering Local Plan 2016-2031.",
    "The maximum number of residents occupying the premises hereby approved shall not exceed 4 at any one time and rooms shall be single occupancy only.",
    "Reason:-",

    "No building shall be occupied or use commenced until cycle storage is provided in accordance with details previously submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority. The cycle storage shall be permanently retained thereafter.",
    "Reason:-",
    "Insufficient information has been supplied with the application to demonstrate what facilities will be available for cycle parking.  Submission of this detail prior to occupation in the case of new building works or prior to the use commencing in the case of changes of use is in the interests of providing a wide range of facilities for non-motor car residents and sustainability.",
    "No building shall be occupied or use commenced until refuse and recycling facilities are provided in accordance with details which shall previously have been submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority. The refuse and recycling facilities shall be permanently retained thereafter.",

    "Insufficient information has been supplied with the application to judge how refuse and recycling will be managed on site.  Submission of this detail prior to occupation in the case of new building works or prior to the use commencing in the case of changes of use will protect the amenity of occupiers of the development and also the locality generally.",

    "Reason:  To prevent noise nuisance to adjoining properties and between habitable rooms in the development.",
    "Prior to the commencement of any development an assessment shall be undertaken of the impact of road noise emanating from Mawney Road upon the development. Reference should be made to the good standard to be found in the World Health Organisation Guidelines for Community Noise 1999 and BS8233:2014.   Following this, a scheme detailing measures, which are to protect occupants from road traffic noise shall be submitted to, and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority and shall be implemented prior to occupation.",
    "Reason:  To protect future residents against the impact of road noise.",
    "1) Prior to the occupation of the premises as a C2 use, a full and detailed application for the Secured by Design award scheme shall be submitted to the Local Planning Authority and the Metropolitan Police NE Designing out Crime Office, demonstrating how the Secured by Design Certificate will be achieved for this scheme",
    "2)  Once approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority in consultation with the Metropolitan Police Designing out Crime Officers, the development shall be carried out in accordance with the agreed details",
    "Reason: In the interest of creating safer, sustainable communities.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35(2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management) Order 2015: No significant problems were identified during the consideration of the application, and therefore it has been determined in accordance with paragraph 38 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2019.",
    "In aiming to satisfy any Secured by Design condition, the applicant must seek advice of the Metropolitan Police Service Designing out Crime Officers (DOCOs) to achieve accreditation. The services of MPS DOCOs are available free of charge and can be contacted via docomailbox.ne@met.police.uk",
