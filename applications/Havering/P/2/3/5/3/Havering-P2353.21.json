    "The proposed development, by reason of its design, excessive size and bulk and position close to the boundaries of the site, in combination with the excessive width of the first floor rear extension would significantly harm the building by over-dominating the host building in a prominent position and therefore would unacceptably be an intrusive and unneighbourly development thereby having an adverse effect on the visual amenities and character of the area, contrary to the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document, policies D1, D3 and D4 of The London Plan (2021) and Policies 7 and 26 of the Local Plan.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, it was necessary to issue a decision as close to the statutory timeframe as possible as opposed to seeking amendments which would have significantly delayed the application."
