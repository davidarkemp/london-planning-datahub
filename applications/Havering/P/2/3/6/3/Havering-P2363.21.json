    "The site is within the Metropolitan Green Belt and the proposed development would not align with any of the relevant exceptions set out in Section 13 of the NPPF and would therefore comprise of inappropriate development. The provision of a dwelling in this location would not represent infill development would represent an unwelcome urbanisation of an open area beyond established settlement boundaries and if permitted would set a harmful precedent. In the absence of any Very Special Circumstances which would outweigh the harm of inappropriateness and harm to openness the proposed development is unacceptable in principle and in contrast to the objectives of the NPPF including the purposes of including land within the Green Belt and Policy G2 of the London Plan 2021.",

Based upon the information supplied with the application, the Mayoral CIL payable would be  £6,725 based on the calculation of £25.00 per square metre and the Havering Community Infrastructure Levy (HCIL) would be a charge of £33,625 based on calculation of £125 per square metre. Each would be subject to indexation.",
