    "The proposed dwellings would, by reason of their scale, bulk, mass and siting, appear incongruous and out of character in the open and spacious rear garden environment, which is characterised by large undeveloped rear gardens of properties in Wilfred Avenue, harmful to the character and appearance of the surrounding area and contrary to Policies 10 and 26 of the Havering Local Plan.",
    "The access road would, by reason of its position, length and proximity to neighbouring properties, result in noise and disturbance harmful to the amenity of adjacent occupiers, including No. 28 Wilfred Avenue, contrary to Policies 7 and 10 of the Havering Local Plan.",
    "There is one car parking space each for the proposed two bedroom dwellings as well as four garage (or car parking) spaces, which exceeds the maximum car parking provision of up to 1.5 spaces contrary to the aim of the Mayor to reduce car use and contrary to Policy 24 of the Havering Local Plan and Policy T6.1 of the London Plan.",
    "The submitted FRA has failed to demonstrate how the proposed development and the site users will be kept safe for the lifetime of the development as there is no adequate assessment of the risk of tidal flooding, which includes the risk of a breach in the Thames tidal flood defences. Therefore, the FRA does not comply with paragraph 164 of the National Planning Policy Framework, which requires any new developments to be safe from flooding for their lifetime, without increasing flood risk elsewhere. The submitted FRA does not therefore provide a suitable basis for assessment to be made of the tidal flood risks impacting on the proposed development. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy 32 of the Havering Local Plan, Policy SI 12 of the London Plan 2021 and the guidance contained in the National Planning Policy Framework.",
