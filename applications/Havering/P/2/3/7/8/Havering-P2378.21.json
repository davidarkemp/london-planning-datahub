    "The site is within the Metropolitan Green Belt and the proposed development would not align fully with any of the exceptions set out in Section 13 of the NPPF and would therefore comprise of inappropriate development. The provision of two additional dwellings in the location shown together with associated access and curtilage would have a material impact on the openness of the Green Belt in this location. In the absence of any Very Special Circumstances which would outweigh the harm of inappropriateness and harm to openness the proposed development is unacceptable in principle and in contrast to the objectives of the NPPF including the purposes of including land within the Green Belt and Policy G2 of the London Plan 2021.",
