    "The proposed first floor side extension, by reason of its depth would materially adversely impact upon the amenities of the neighbour at no. 24 Northumberland Avenue, in terms of blocking access to direct sunlight to their rear facing window and patio, and overbearing and unneighboulry impact, contrary to policy 7 of the Havering Local Plan (2016-2031) and Havering's Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD (adopted 2011).",
