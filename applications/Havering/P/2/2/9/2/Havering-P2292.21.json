    "The development to which this permission relates must be commenced not later than three years from the date of this permission.",

No demolition or construction works or deliveries shall take place on Sundays, Bank or Public Holidays unless otherwise agreed in writing by the local planning authority.",

    "g) siting and design of temporary buildings if required;",
    "h) scheme for se",
    "The garages hereby permitted shall be used solely for domestic use (vehicular parking) and not for any commercial or industrial usage and their allocation shall be prioritised to flats 1-36 Stirling Close.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To protect residential amenity and to meet the minimum residential parking standards in this location (Local Plan policies 7, 24 and 34).",
    "Prior to above ground works, a full and detailed application for the Secured by Design award scheme shall be submitted to the Local Planning Authority and the Metropolitan Police NE Designing out Crime Office, demonstrating how Secured by Design Certification will be achieved for this scheme. The details shall include details of a Closed Circuit Television (CCTV) for the development, details of a lighting scheme for the development and details to improve the safety of the pedestrian entrance. Once approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority in consultation with the Metropolitan Police Designing out Crime Officers, the development shall be carried out in accordance with the agreed details.",
    "Reason:-",
    "In the interest of creating safer, sustainable communities Local Plan policy 26 and London Plan (2021) policy D11.",
    "All hard surfaces hereby approved as part of the development (including any sub-base) shall be made of porous materials or provision shall be made to direct run-off water from the hard surface to a permeable or porous area or surface within the curtilage of the application site.",
    "Reason:-",
    "In order to ensure no water run-off from the hard surface which would contribute to risk of flooding (Local Plan policy 32 and London Plan policies SI 12 and SI 13).",
    "Statement Required by Article 35(2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management) Order 2015: No significant problems were identified during the consideration of the application, and therefore it has been determined in accordance with paragraph 38 of the National Planning Policy Framework.",
