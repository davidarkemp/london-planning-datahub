    "The proposed development would, by reason of its size, design, appearance and siting in a prominent corner, fail to integrate acceptably with the host dwelling and would appear as an anomaly within the wider street scene. The development would therefore be visually intrusive, and out of scale and character with the established building line and pattern of development in the surrounding environment and be harmful to the appearance of the site and surrounding area contrary to Policy 7 and Policy 26 of the Havering Local Plan 2021.",
    "The proposed development, by reason of its sub-standard internal floorspace for the new 3b4p dwelling, lack of provision of separate amenity space for the new 3b4p dwelling unit and  providing a constrained and sub-standard residential accommodation for future occupiers which would adversely impact on their living condition, contrary to the aims and objectives of London Plan Policy D6 and Policy 26 of the Havering Local Plan 2021.",
    "The rear dormer would, by reason of its excessive width and design would result in a dominant and visual intrusive extension detrimental to the character and appearance of the host property and visual amenity of the locality contrary to Policy 26 of the Havering Local Plan 2021.",
    "The proposal, if granted planning permission on appeal, would be liable for the Council and the Mayor of London Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). Based upon the information supplied with the application, the CIL payable would be Â£9250. Further details with regard to CIL are available from the Council's website.",
