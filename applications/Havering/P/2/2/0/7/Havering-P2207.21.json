    "Insufficient justification has been provided as to the current condition of the windows, whether repair/refurbishment would be possible together with secondary glazing as a possible alternative. It is considered that the removal of all historic frames and glass panes would cause harm to the historic, architectural interest and aesthetic value of the property, eroding its evidential value. Furthermore, the proposed replacement modern double-glazed units will introduce a discernibly modern appearance with double reflection, which would materially and unacceptably detract from the character and appearance of the application premises, to the detriment of the street-scene and fail to preserve the site's contribution to the character and appearance of the Gidea Park Conservation Area. The proposal would neither preserve, nor enhance the special character of the Gidea Park Conservation Area and is therefore contrary to Policies 26 and 28 of the Havering Local Plan (2016-2031), Policy HC1 of t",
