Based upon the information supplied with the application, the Mayoral CIL payable would be £4,375. based on the calculation of ?£25.00 per square metre and the Havering Community Infrastructure Levy (HCIL) would be a charge of ?£21,875 based on calculation of ?£125 per square metre. Each would be subject to indexation.",
