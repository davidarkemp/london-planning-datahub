    "The proposed rear outbuilding, by reason of its design, scale, massing and excessive width within the plot, is considered to be an incongruous structure and would result in a visually dominant structure within its rear garden setting which would be harmful to the character and appearance of the host building and fail to conserve or enhance the surrounding Gidea Park Conservation Area. The proposals are contrary to Local Plan policies 26 and 28; London Plan (2021) policy HC1 and paragraph 202 of the NPPF (2021).",
