    "The development to which this permission relates must be commenced not later than three years from the date of this permission.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To comply with the requirements of Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended by Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004).",
    "The development hereby permitted shall not be carried out otherwise than in complete accordance with the approved plans (as set out on page one of this decision notice).",
    "Reason:-",
    "For the avoidance of doubt and to ensure that the development is carried out as approved.",
    "Prior to above ground works, a written specification of external walls and roof materials to be used in the construction of the building(s) shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority and thereafter the development shall be constructed with the approved materials.",
    "Reason:-",
    "Insufficient information has been supplied with the application to judge the appropriateness of the materials to be used.  Submission of a written specification prior to above ground works will ensure that the appearance of the proposed development will harmonise with the character of the surrounding area.",
    "Before the dwellings hereby permitted are first occupied, the car parking provision as shown on drawing No.'s NAD.21.207-02 Revision H and NAD.21.207-03 Revision H shall be laid out and implemented to the full satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority and thereafter this car parking provision shall remain unobstructed and permanently available for use, unless otherwise agreed with the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To ensure that car parking accommodation is made permanently available to the standards adopted by the Local Planning Authority in the interest of highway safety, and that the development accords with Policy 24 of the Havering Local Plan.",
    "All hard surfaces hereby approved as part of the development (including any sub-base) shall be made of porous materials or provision shall be made to direct run-off water from the hard surface to a permeable or porous area or surface within the curtilage of the application site.",
    "Reason:-",
    "In order to ensure no water run-off from the hard surface which would contribute to risk of flooding.",
    "Prior to the first occupation of the dwellings hereby approved and notwithstanding the details on Drawing No.'s  NAD.21.207-02 Revision H and NAD.21.207-03 Revision H, a scheme of hard and soft landscaping, which shall include indications of all existing trees and shrubs on the site, and details of any to be retained, together with measures for the protection in the course of development shall be submitted to and approved by the Local Planning Authority. All planting, seeding or turfing comprised within the scheme shall be carried out in the first planting season following completion of the development and any trees or plants which within a period of 5 years from completion of the development die, are removed or become seriously damaged or diseased shall be replaced in the next planting season with others of a similar size and species, unless otherwise agreed in writing by the local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:-",
    "Reason: Insufficient information has been supplied with the application t",
    "Prior to the first occupation of the development hereby approved, details of all proposed walls, fences and boundary treatment, including details of the acoustic fence on the north western boundary of the site as shown on Drawing No. NAD.21.207-02 Revision H, shall be submitted to, and approved in writing by, the Local Planning Authority.  The boundary development and acoustic fence shall then be carried out in accordance with the approved details and retained permanently thereafter to the satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:",
    "Insufficient information has been supplied with the application to judge the appropriateness of any boundary treatment and acoustic fencing.  Submission of this detail prior to the first occupation of the development hereby approved will protect the visual amenities of the development, prevent undue overlooking of adjoining property.",
    "Prior to the first occupation of the dwellings hereby permitted, the proposed cycle stores shown on Drawing No.'s NAD.21.207-02 Revision H and NAD.21.207-03 Revision H shall be provided to the satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority. The cycle storage shall be permanently retained thereafter.",
    "Reason:-",
    "In the interests of providing a wide range of facilities for non-motor car residents and sustainability.",
    "Notwithstanding the details on Drawing No.'s NAD.21.207-02 Revision H and NAD.21.207-03 Revision H, no building shall be occupied or use commenced until refuse and recycling facilities are provided in accordance with details which shall previously have been submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority. The refuse and recycling facilities shall be permanently retained thereafter.",
    "Reason:-",
    "Reason: Insufficient information has been supplied with the application to judge how refuse and recycling will be managed on site. Submission of this detail prior to occupation in the case of new building works or prior to the use commencing in the case of changes of use will protect the amenity of occupiers of the development and also the locality generally and ensure that the development accords with Policy 35 of the Havering Local Plan.",
    "Before the development hereby permitted is first commenced, vehicle cleansing facilities to prevent mud being deposited onto the public highway during construction works shall be provided on site in accordance with details to be first submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority. The approved facilities shall be retained thereafter and used at relevant entrances to the site throughout the duration of construction works. If mud or other debris originating from the site is deposited in the public highway, all on-site operations shall cease until it has been removed.",
