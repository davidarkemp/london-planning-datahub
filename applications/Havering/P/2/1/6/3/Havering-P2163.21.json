    "The proposed extension would, by reason of its mass, bulk, height and close proximity to the common boundary with neighbour no. 69 Slewins Lane would result in an increased sense of enclosure and an overbearing effect and would cause an adverse impact on the visual amenity enjoyed from the neighbouring property, contrary to Local Plan Policy 7 and the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to Mr P Easthope (agent) by email on 10/02/22.",
    "Staff note that the existing location plan and proposed site/block plan shown on the drawing 01 (Revision B) do not correlate with site photographs provided to support the application. Specifically, they do not illustrate the extensions to no. 73 Slewins Lane."
