    "The development to which this permission relates must be commenced not later than three years from the date of this permission.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To comply with the requirements of Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended by Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004).",
    "The development hereby permitted shall not be carried out otherwise than in complete accordance with the approved plans (as set out on page one of this decision notice).",
    "Reason:-",
    "For the avoidance of doubt and to ensure that the development is carried out as approved.",
    "The premises shall not be used for the purposes hereby permitted other than between the hours of 08:00 and 18:00 on Mondays to Fridays, 08:00 and 16:00 on Saturdays and not at all on Sundays, Bank or Public holidays without the prior consent in writing of the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To enable the Local Planning Authority to retain control in the interests of amenity.",
    "Before any works commence a scheme for any new plant or machinery shall be submitted to the local planning authority to achieve the following standard: The sound rating level emitted from plant, machinery or equipment at the development hereby approved shall be lower than the background sound level (LA90, 1hr) by at least 10dBA in order to prevent any adverse impact. The assessment shall be made in accordance with BS4142:2014+A1:2019 at the nearest and/or most affected noise sensitive premises.   The equipment shall be maintained thereafter to the satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority to ensure that the requirements of the condition is complied with.  If at any time the plant is determined by the Local Planning Authority to be failing to comply with this condition, its use shall cease until rectified.",
    "Reason:  Insufficient information has been supplied with the application with regards to a scheme for any new plant or machinery.  Submission of this detail prior to commencemen",
    "No building shall be occupied or use commenced until refuse and recycling facilities are provided in accordance with details which shall previously have been submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority. The refuse and recycling facilities shall be permanently retained thereafter.",
    "Reason:-",
    "Insufficient information has been supplied with the application to judge how refuse and recycling will be managed on site.  Submission of this detail prior to occupation in the case of new building works or prior to the use commencing in the case of changes of use will protect the amenity of occupiers of the development and also the locality generally.",
    "No vehicle maintenance work shall occur on the site in the open air, but shall occur within the confines of the building.  External access doors shall remain closed when any noisy works are occurring within the workshop, save for the ingress and egress of vehicles to the workshop.",
    "Reason:  To prevent noise nuisance to adjacent properties and ensure that the development accords with Policy 7 of the Havering Local Plan.",
    "No deliveries or collections from the site shall take place other than between the hours of 08.00 to 18.00 on Monday to Friday and 08.00 to 13.00 hours on Saturdays unless agreed in writing with the local planning authority.",
    "Reason:  To protect residential amenity.",
    "All building operations in connection with the construction of external walls, roof, and foundations; site excavation or other external site works; works involving the use of plant or machinery; the erection of scaffolding; the delivery of materials; the removal of materials and spoil from the site, and the playing of amplified music shall only take place between the hours of 8.00am and 6.00pm Monday to Friday, and between 8.00am and 1.00pm on Saturdays and not at all on Sundays and Bank Holidays/Public Holidays.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To protect residential amenity.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35(2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management) Order 2015: No significant problems were identified during the consideration of the application, and therefore it has been determined in accordance with paragraph 38 of the National Planning Policy Framework.",
    "A fee is required when submitting details pursuant to the discharge of conditions.  In order to comply with the Town and Country Planning (Fees for Applications, Deemed Applications, Requests and Site Visits) (England) Regulations 2012, (as amended), a fee of £116 per request or £34 where the related permission was for extending or altering a dwellinghouse, is needed."
