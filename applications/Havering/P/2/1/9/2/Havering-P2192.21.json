    "The proposed development would not be subservient to the roof of the property, would alter the basic shape of the roof on the semi-detached house which is unacceptable as it leads to an imbalance between the pair and creates a visually heavy roof to one half causing a negative effect on the street scene by the loss of symmetry. Accordingly the proposal is of a poor quality design which is contrary to the purposes and intent of Policies 7 and 26 of the Local Plan, the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document and Policy D4 of the London Plan.",
    "The proposed rear extension, by reason of its depth, would be an intrusive and unneighbourly development and have an adverse effect on the amenity of the adjacent occupiers at Nos. 29 Ferguson Avenue, contrary to Policy 7 of the local plan and the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to the agent via email on 24/01/22."
