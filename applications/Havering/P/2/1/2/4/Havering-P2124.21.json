    "The proposed development would, by reason of its design, bulk, and mass, appear as an incongurous development which would be an unacceptably dominant and visually intrusive feature in the streetscene. This would harm the appearance of the surrounding area, being contrary to Policy 26 of the local plan, the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document, and the London Plan 2021. In addition, due to its design, bulk and proximity to the shared boundary, the development would cause an overbearing impact and increased sense of enclosure, to the detriment of the amenity enjoyed by the occupiers of nos. 15,and 19 Dominion Way, contrary to Policy 7 of the Havering Local Plan.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason for it was given to the agent by email on 22/07/2022."
