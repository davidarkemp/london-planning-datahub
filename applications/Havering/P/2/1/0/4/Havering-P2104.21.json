    "The proposed dwellings would, by reason of their scale, bulk, mass, siting and position on and close to the boundaries of the site, be an unneighbourly development, appear visually intrusive and overbearing in the rear garden environment and be materially harmful to the amenity of neighbouring properties, including undue overlooking and loss of privacy.",
    "In the absence of a legal agreement to prevent future occupants from applying for or obtaining a residents parking permit, the proposal fails to satisfactorily mitigate the parking impacts of the development, contrary to the provisions of Policy 24 of the Havering Local Plan (2016-2031) and Policy T6.1 of the London Plan.",
    "In the absence of a legal agreement to secure the cost of removing a street tree and the planting of two smaller replacement trees elsewhere in Stanley Road North, the proposal is contrary to Policy 2 of the London Borough of Havering Tree Strategy 2009-2019.",
    "For Residential Development Only",
    "Please be advised that approval of this application from 1st September 2019 (either by London Borough of Havering, or subsequently by PINS if allowed on appeal following a refusal by London Borough of Havering) will attract a liability payment of £22,350 plus indexation in Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This charge has been levied under s.206 of the Planning Act 2008 and includes both the Mayor of London's CIL and Havering Council's CIL.",
    "London Borough of Havering, as CIL collecting authority, has responsibility for the collection of the Mayoral CIL, in addition to Havering's CIL, on commencement of the development.",
    "Your proposal is subject to a CIL Liability Notice indicating a levy of £3,725 plus indexation for the application, based on the Mayoral CIL levy rate for Havering of £25/sq.m plus Havering's charging rate for residential of £125/sq.m (Zone A) and the floorspace of 149 square metres.",
    "You are advised to visit the planning portal w",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: In accordance with paragraph 38 of the National Planning Policy Framework, improvements required to make the proposal acceptable were negotiated with The JTS Partnership LLP via email on 28th July 2022.  The revisions involved enlarging the application site and altering the internal layout of the proposed dwellings or replacing the pair of semi-detached dwellings with one single storey dwelling. The applicant declined to make the suggested revisions."
