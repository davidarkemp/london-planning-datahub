    "The proposed rear dormer window, by reason of its width, bulk, massing and design, would occupy an unacceptably large area of the rear roof slope, forming a dominant and visually intrusive feature, detrimental to the character and appearance of the property and materially harmful to the visual amenity of the surrounding area contrary to Policy 7 of the local plan and the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: In accordance with paragraph 38 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2018, improvements required to make the proposal acceptable were negotiated with the agent on 20/12/21. The revisions involved decreasing the width and height of the proposal in order to reduce its bulk, scale and mass. The suggested revisions were declined."
