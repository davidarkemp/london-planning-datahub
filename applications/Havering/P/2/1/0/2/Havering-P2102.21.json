    "The development would, by reason of its scale, bulk and mass, appear incongruous and be unacceptably dominant and visually intrusive feature in the rear garden scene, harmful to the character and appearance of the surrounding area, contrary to the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document, policy D4 of The London Plan (2021) and Policies 7 and 26 of the Local Plan.",
    "The Council consider that the impact of the development on the amenities of the adjoining properties at Nos. 283 and 287 Carter Drive would be unacceptable by reason of noise disturbance, contrary to Policy 7 of the Local Plan and the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document.",
