    "The proposed development would, by reason of its excessive scale, bulk, height, design and cramped layout appear as an unacceptably dominant, oppressive and visually intrusive feature  within the streetscene and be detrimental to visual amenity and to the character and appearance of the surrounding area contrary to Local Plan Policy 26.",
    "The proposed layout and design of the development together with the position of the front forecourt parking would create an obstructive and cramped layout and would fail to provide safe, inclusive, accessible and fit for purpose access to the development for future residents contrary to policies 10, 23, 24 and 26 of the Local Plan, policies D4, D5, D6, D7, D11, T2 and T4 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority that adequate refuse and recycling provision and cycle storage could feasibly be accommodated on-site. The proposed development is therefore contrary to Local Plan policies 23 and 35 and London Plan (2021) policy T5.",
    "The proposals would result in an overprovision of on-site parking and increase car dominance contrary to Local Plan policies 23 and 24 of the Havering Local Plan, London Plan policies T1, T2, T6 and T6.1 and paragraph 104 of the NPPF (2021).",
    "In the absence of sufficient information it has not been demonstrated that the proposed dwellings would be provide with an acceptable standard of private outside amenity space and therefore fail to provide a good standard of accommodation for future occupiers contrary to Local Plan Policy 7 and London Plan policy D6.",
    "The proposed development would have an unacceptable impact on the daylight received to ground floor side windows of 'Bossington' No. 3 Fullers Lane and would result in the loss of outlook and daylight to the upper floor windows of No. 104 Brockley Crescent and impact on the outlook from the rear patio area of this property.  As such the proposals are considered to be detrimental to the residential amenity of neighbouring occupiers contrary to Local Plan Policy 7.",
    "The proposal, if granted planning permission on appeal, will create 3 new residential units with 522sqm of new gross internal floorspace. The proposal is liable for LB Havering CIL and will incur a charge of £65,250 (subject to indexation) based on the calculation of £125.00 per square metre. The proposal is also liable for Mayoral CIL and will incur a charge of £13,050 (subject to indexation) based on the calculation of £25.00 per square metre.",
    "Further details with regard to CIL are available from the Council's website.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to the Agent by email on the 16/02/2022."
