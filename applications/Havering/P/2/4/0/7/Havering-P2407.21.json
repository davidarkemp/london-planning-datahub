    "The proposed development by reason of the overall depth and being built to the common boundary would have an intrusive and overbearing impact upon the amenity of the neighbour at no.2 Peony Road, contrary to Havering's Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD (adopted 2011) and  Policy 7 of the Local Plan.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, it was necessary to issue a decision as close to the statutory timeframe as possible as opposed to seeking amendments which would have significantly delayed the application."
