    "The boundary treatment, by reason of its siting, height and length would upset the harmonious openness of the streetscene and appear as an incongruous, dominant and visually intrusive feature in the streetscene harmful to the character of the surrounding area contrary to Policy 27 of the Local Plan, the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document and the London Plan 2021.",
