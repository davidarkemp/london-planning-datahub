    "The proposed dwelling would through the constrained proportions of the site and limited plot size, inappropriate design and appearance appear as a disproportionately narrow feature in the street-scene harmful to the characteristic spacing of the area; and through limited separation from shared boundaries and the limited plot size the development would read as a cramped overdevelopment of the site. It would therefore be harmful to the character and appearance of the area and prevailing pattern of development contrary to policies D4 and D6 of the London Plan 2021, Policy 26 of the Local Plan (2021) and Paragraph 124 (d) of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The scale, bulk and mass of the proposed dwelling and close proximity to neighbouring properties would be harmful to the outlook from No. 140 Chatteris Avenue and result in an intrusive and overbearing feature as a separate unit of accommodation contrary to Policy 26 of the Local Plan (2021) and Paragraph 130(f) of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "The proposed layout and design of the development together with the position of the refuse and cycle storage and front forecourt parking would create an obstructive and cramped layout and would fail to provide safe, inclusive, accessible and fit for purpose access to the development for future residents contrary to policies 10, 23, 24, 26 and 35 of the Local Plan, policies D4, D5, D6, D7, T5 and T6.1 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority that adequate refuse and recycling provision and cycle storage could feasibly be accommodated on-site. The proposed development is therefore contrary to Local Plan policies 23 and 35 and London Plan (2021) policy T5.",
    "In the absence of sufficient information it has not been demonstrated that the proposed dwelling would be provide with an acceptable standard of private outside amenity space and therefore fail to provide a good standard of accommodation for future occupiers contrary to Local Plan Policy 7 and London Plan policy D6.",
    "The proposal, if granted planning permission on appeal, will create 1 new residential units with 60sqm of new gross internal floorspace. The proposal is liable for LB Havering CIL and will incur a charge of £7,500 (subject to indexation) based on the calculation of £125.00 per square metre. The proposal is also liable for Mayoral CIL and will incur a charge of £1,500 (subject to indexation) based on the calculation of £25.00 per square metre.",
