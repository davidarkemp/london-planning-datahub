    "The proposed development, would by reason of its bulk, mass and siting, represent an overdevelopment of the rear garden environment which is inconsistent with the prevailing open character of the rear garden scene and pattern of development within the Emerson Park Character Areas, contrary Policy 7 and Policy 10 of the Local Plan 2021 and the Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD (2011).",
    "The proposed development, which could function as a self-contained residential unit in the rear garden scene, would result in an unprecedented and unacceptable impact to amenity of the existing and the prospective occupiers in terms of poor standard of accommodation, including additional comings and goings, increased intensity of use of the rear garden area, contrary to D6 of the London Plan, Policy 7 and Policy 10 of the Local Plan 2021 and the Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD (2011).",
    "In the absence of a full Tree Survey, the proposed development would result in the removal and/or harm to trees on/adjacent site, which would be materially harmful to the character and amenity of site and surrounding area, contrary to Policies 26 and 27 of the Local Plan (2021) and the Protection of Trees during Development Supplementary Planning Document.",
