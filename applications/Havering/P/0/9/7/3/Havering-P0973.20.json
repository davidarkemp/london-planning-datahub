    "The proposed extension of operating hours would, by reason of its location and relationship to nearby sensitive receptors, result in an unsatisfactory relationship by way of noise and disturbance which would be to the detriment of the amenity and living conditions of neighbouring occupiers. The proposal failed to provide adequate acoustic justification to demonstrate that residential amenity would not be adversely impacted. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD.",
