    "The proposed loft conversion including the hip to gable roof conversion and rear dormer window would unbalance the appearance of this pair of semi-detached pair and appear as an unacceptably dominant and visually intrusive feature in the street scene and rear garden harmful to the appearance of the surrounding area, contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document, the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document and Policy 7.4 of the London Plan.",
    "The single storey rear extension would, by reason of its height and position close to the boundaries of the site, be an intrusive and unneighbourly development as well as having an adverse effect on the amenities of adjacent occupiers at No.27 Cromer Road, Romford, contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document and the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary.",
    "The proposed rear dormer window would, by reason of its scale, bulk and mass appear out of scale and character with the dwelling and materially harmful to the visual amenity of the surrounding area contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document, the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document and Policy 7.4 of the London Plan.",
