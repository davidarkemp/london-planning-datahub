    "Reason:-",
    "For the avoidance of doubt and to ensure that the development is carried out as approved. Also, in order that the development accords with Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policy DC61.",

    "Reason:-",
    "In order to ensure a satisfactory development that will not result in any loss of privacy or damage to the environment of neighbouring properties which exist or may be proposed in the future, and in order that the development accords with Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policy DC61.",
