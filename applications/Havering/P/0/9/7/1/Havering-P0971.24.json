    "The cumulative impact of the hip to gable roof alteration and rear dormer window would have a top heavy appearance and give rise to development which is disproportionately large and which would unbalance the appearance of this pair of semi-detached properties and appear as an unacceptably dominant and visually intrusive feature in the street scene and rear garden harmful to the appearance of the surrounding area, contrary to Policy 26 of the Havering Local Plan, D4 of the London Plan and the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document.",
    "The proposed large ancillary stock/store room would, by reason of its excessive size, scale, height, bulk and mass give rise to an intrusive and overbearing form of development in relation to the neighbouring residential rear gardens, and would introduce an incongruous built form which would be unsympathetic and visually intrusive and harmful to neighbouring residential amenity and therefore would be contrary to Policies 26 and 7 of the Havering Local Plan, D4 of the London Plan, the Havering's Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD and the guidance contained in the National Planning Policy Framework.",
    "The proposal, by reason of noise and disturbance caused by customers entering and leaving the premises, vehicles parking and manoeuvring, would be unacceptably detrimental to the amenities of occupiers of adjacent properties, contrary to Policy 7 of the Havering Local Plan.",
