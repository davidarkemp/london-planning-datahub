  "decision_conditions": [
    "The development to which this permission relates must be commenced not later than three years from the date of this permission.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To comply with the requirements of Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended by Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004).",
    "The development hereby permitted shall not be carried out otherwise than in complete accordance with the approved plans (as set out on page one of this decision notice).",
    "Reason:-",
    "For the avoidance of doubt and to ensure that the development is carried out as approved.",
    "No structures, including guttering, shall overhang the shared boundaries. This includes the shared boundary between the site area (14 Argyle Gardens), and the following properties:",
    "-12 Argyle Gardens,",
    "-16 Argyle Gardens",
    "-5 New Place Gardens",
    "-7 New Place Gardens",
    "Reason:-",
    "In the interest of preserving neighbouring amenity.",
    "The proposed annexe shall be used only for living accommodation as an integral part of the existing dwelling known as 14 Argyle Gardens and shall not be used as a separate unit of residential accommodation at any time.",
    "Reason:-",
    "The site is within an area where the Local Planning Authority consider that the sub-division of existing properties should not be permitted in the interests of amenity, and that the development accords with the Local Plan Policy 7.",
    "The proposed development hereby approved shall be constructed in accordance with the materials detailed under Section 10 of the application form unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason: To ensure that the appearance of the proposed development will harmonise with the character of the surrounding area.",
    "Notwithstanding the provisions of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 2015;-",
    "- no door openings or clear glazed windows shall be inserted into the north, south, and west facing side elevation or rear elevation of the building hereby approved;",
    "- no gate, door or other opening shall be inserted into the north, south, and west boundary fence of the property.",
    "The annexe shall at all times only be accessed through the main dwelling and garden of 14 Argyle Gardens, Upminster.",
    "Reason:-",
    "The site is within an area where the Local Planning Authority consider that the sub-division of existing properties should not be permitted in the interests of amenity, and that the development accords with the Local Plan Policy 7.",
    "The annexe hereby permitted shall not be arranged, let or disposed of as a separate unit of residential accommodation and shall not be used for any commercial purposes.",
    "Reason:-",
    "In order that the annex approved remains ancillary to the main dwelling and that the development accords with the Local Plan Policy 7.",
    "No works shall take place in relation to any of the development hereby approved until a scheme for the protection of established trees on the site has been submitted to and agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority. Such scheme shall contain details of the erection and maintenance of fences or walls around the trees, details of underground measures to protect roots, the control of areas around the trees and any other measures necessary for the protection of the trees. Such agreed measures shall be implemented before development commences and kept in place until the approved development is completed.",
    "Reason:-",
    "Insufficient information has been supplied with the application to demonstrate how the mature  trees on site will be adequately protected during construction.  Submission of details prior to commencement will ensure that the measures to be employed are robust.",
    "Please note that the planning service does not police private development, and cannot become involved in covenant or deed disputes which involve boundary or party wall disputes.",
    "It is recommended that the  Citizens Advice Bureau is contacted in the first instance.",
    "Further information regarding planning enforcement can be found here: https://www.havering.gov.uk/info/20034/planning/146/planning_enforcement",
    "Statement Required by Article 35(2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management) Order 2015: No significant problems were identified during the consideration of the application, and therefore it has been determined in accordance with paragraph 38 of the National Planning Policy Framework."
