    "The proposed development would, due to its design approach and layout, in particular the close proximity of the newly proposed boundary treatments to the existing first floor flat on the site give rise to a cramped form of development which would result in substantial harm to outlook and an increased sense of enclosure plus noise resulting from the intensity of use of the proposed communal amenity area to the detriment of the amenity of the occupiers of neighbouring properties particularly the approved first floor flat on site, in direct contrast to the aims and objectives of London Plan Policies D6, D14  and Policy 7 of the Local Plan 2021.",
    "The proposed development would result in poor living conditions for future occupiers of the proposed development. The constraints of the site in conjunction with the design approach adopted would be to the detriment of the amenity of future occupiers in terms of privacy, noise and general disturbance associated with the use of the communal amenity area. The design will result in substandard living conditions for future occupants, in direct contrast to the aims of the London Plan Policies D6, D14 and Policy 7 of the of the Local Plan 2021.",
    "In the absence of a legal agreement to prevent future occupants from obtaining parking permits, the proposal will result in an overspill of car parking to the detriment of the surrounding area, contrary to the provisions of Policy T6.1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy 24 of the Local Plan 2021.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to Lina Haman (agent) via email on 10th August 2022.",
    "The proposal, if granted planning permission on appeal, would be liable for Havering and Mayor of London Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). Based upon the information supplied with the application, the CIL payable would be £6,875(Havering CIL) + £1,375 (London Mayor CIL). Further details with regard to CIL are available from the Council's website."
