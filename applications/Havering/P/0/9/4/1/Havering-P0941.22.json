    "The proposed rear extension with screening would, by reason of its excessive depth, height and proximity to the shared boundary with no.53 Links Avenue, be an intrusive and unneighbourly development resulting in a significant loss of outlook and an increased sense of enclosure to the occupiers at No.53 Links Avenue, contrary to the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document and Policies 7 and 26 of the Local Plan.",
    "The proposed rear terrace/balcony would afford commanding views of the properties and gardens of neighbouring dwellings and result in an unacceptable loss of privacy, noise and undue overlooking of the rear garden environment to the detriment of adjacent occupiers contrary to the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document and Policy 7 of the Local Plan.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, it was necessary to issue a decision as close to the statutory timeframe as possible as opposed to seeking amendments which would have significantly delayed the application."
