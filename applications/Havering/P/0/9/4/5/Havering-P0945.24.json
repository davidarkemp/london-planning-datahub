    "The proposed dwelling would appear as an incongruous form of development within the rear garden environment of Priory Road, out of character with the surrounding environment and established pattern of development creating a cramped form of development that would adversely affect the openess of the area and therefore be harmful to local character and visual amenity of the locality. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policies 7, 10 and 26 of the Havering Local Plan as well as also Paragraph 135(c) of the NPPF which requires developments to be sympathetic to local character, including the surrounding built environment.",
    "The proposed development, by reason of the proximity of the windows to bedrooms 2 and 3 to the rear boundary of the site, would provide poor aspect and inadequate outlook from these habitable rooms resulting in substandard residential accomodation detrimental to the amenity of future occupants, contrary to the provisions of Policies D5 and D6 of the London Plan and Policies 7 and 10 of the Havering Local Plan.",
    "The proposed dwelling, by reason of its bulk, scale, massing, height and proximity to the shared neighbouring boundaries of nos. 21 and 23 Priory Road, would form a visually intrusive and overbearing feature from adjacent rear gardens of these properties and therefore be detrimental to neighbouring amenity, contrary to Policies 7, 10 and 26 of the Havering Local Plan. There would also be conflict with paragraph 135(f) of the National Planning Policy Framework which seeks to ensure a high standard of amenity for existing and future occupiers.",
    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate that the vehicle crossover proposed could be implemented without harm to the existing street tree located to the front of the application site along Priory Road. On that basis, there is considered to be conflict with Policies 27 and 30 of the Local Plan as well as the objectives of paragraph 136 of the National Planning Policy Framework.",
    "In the event that this application is allowed through the appeals process, the proposals would be liable for the following CIL contributions:",
    "Havering CIL (MCIL2) contribution of £2,600 (x £25 per sqm).",
    "Mayoral CIL (HCIL) contribution of £13,000 (x £125 per sqm)",
    "Each contribution would be subject to indexation.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to the agent Matthew Driscoll via email on 18/10/2024."
