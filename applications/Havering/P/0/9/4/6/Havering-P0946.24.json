    "The development to which this permission relates must be commenced not later than three years from the date of this permission.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To comply with the requirements of Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended by Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004).",
    "No works shall take place in relation to any of the development hereby approved until details of the external finishing materials, which shall match those of the existing buildings are submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority and thereafter the development shall be constructed with the approved materials.",
    "Reason:-",
    "Insufficient information has been supplied with the application to judge the appropriateness of the external finishing materials to be used.  Submission of samples prior to commencement will safeguard the appearance of the premises and the character of the immediate area.",
    "The development hereby permitted shall not be carried out otherwise than in complete accordance with the approved plans (as set out on page one of this decision notice).",
    "Reason:-",
    "For the avoidance of doubt and to ensure that the development is carried out as approved.",
    "Before the dwelling hereby permitted is first occupied,  car parking provision as for at least two cars shall be laid out and retained permanently thereafter and shall not be used for any other purpose.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To ensure that car parking accommodation is made permanently available to the standards adopted by the Local Planning Authority in the interest of highway safety.",
    "Notwithstanding the provisions of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (Order) or any other order replacing or amending the said Order other than porches erected in accordance with the Order, no extension or enlargement (including additions to roofs) shall be made to the dwellinghouse(s) hereby permitted, or any detached building erected, without the express permission in writing of the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:-",
    "In the interests of amenity and to enable the Local Planning Authority to retain control over future development.",
    "Prior to the occupation of the dwelling hereby permitted the boundary treatment shall be carried out in accordance with the approved drawings and retained permanently thereafter to the satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:",
    "To protect the visual amenities of the development and prevent undue overlooking of adjoining property.",
    "No building shall be occupied or use commenced until refuse and recycling facilities are provided in accordance with details which shall previously have been submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority. The refuse and recycling facilities shall be permanently retained thereafter.",
    "Reason:-",
    "Insufficient information has been supplied with the application to judge how refuse and recycling will be managed on site.  Submission of this detail prior to occupation in the case of new building works or prior to the use commencing in the case of changes of use will protect the amenity of occupiers of the development and also the locality generally.",
    "No building shall be occupied or use commenced until cycle storage is provided in accordance with details previously submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority. The cycle storage shall be permanently retained thereafter.",
    "Reason:-",
    "Insufficient information has been supplied with the application to demonstrate what facilities will be available for cycle parking.  Submission of this detail prior to occupation in the case of new building works or prior to the use commencing in the case of changes of use is in the interests of providing a wide range of facilities for non-motor car residents and sustainability.",
    "Notwithstanding the provisions of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015, no window or other opening (other than those shown on the submitted and approved plan) shall be formed in the flank wall(s) of the building(s) hereby permitted, unless specific permission under the provisions of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 has first been sought and obtained in writing from the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:-",
    "In order to ensure a satisfactory development that will not result in any loss of privacy or damage to the environment of neighbouring properties which exist or may be proposed in the future.",
    "The windows inserted on the first floor flank walls shall be  obscure-glazed, and non-opening unless the parts of the window which can be opened are more than 1.7m above the floor of the room in which the window is installed.",
    "Reason - In the interest of privacy and to protect the amenity of the adjacent neighbours",
    "All building operations in connection with the construction of external walls, roof, and foundations; site excavation or other external site works; works involving the use of plant or machinery; the erection of scaffolding; the delivery of materials; the removal of materials and spoil from the site, and the playing of amplified music shall only take place between the hours of 8.00am and 6.00pm Monday to Friday, and between 8.00am and 1.00pm on Saturdays and not at all on Sundays and Bank Holidays/Public Holidays.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To protect residential amenity.",
    "All dwellings hereby approved shall be constructed to comply with Part M4(2) of the Building Regulations - Accessible and Adaptable Dwellings.",
    "Reason: In order to comply with Policy 7 of the Havering Local Plan and Policy D7 of the London Plan.",
    "All dwellings hereby approved shall comply with Regulation 36 (2)(b) and Part G2 of the Building Regulations - Water Efficiency.",
    "Reason: In order to comply with Policy SI 5 of the London Plan.",
    "All hard surfaces hereby approved as part of the development (including any sub-base) shall be made of porous materials or provision shall be made to direct run-off water from the hard surface to a permeable or porous area or surface within the curtilage of the application site.",
    "Reason:-",
    "In order to ensure no water run-off from the hard surface which would contribute to risk of flooding.",
    "The development hereby approved shall be fitted with Ultra-Low NOx boilers with maximum NOx Emissions less than 40 mg/kWh. Where any installations do not meet this emissions standard it should not be operated without the fitting of suitable NOx abatement equipment or technology as determined by a specialist to ensure comparable emissions. The installation of the boilers shall be carried out in strict accordance with these details and shall thereafter be permanently retained.",
    "Reason: To minimise the impact of building emissions on local air quality.",
    "All residential parking spaces within the development hereby approved shall include provision of infrastructure for electric or Ultra-Low Emission vehicles, of which a minimum of 1 space shall have active charging facilities, with passive provision for all remaining spaces. Such provision is to be made prior to the first occupation of the dwelling hereby permitted.",
    "Reason:  Provision prior to first occupation of the proposed dwellings hereby permitted will ensure that the development adequately incorporates measures to allow the use of electric vehicles by future occupiers in accordance with Policy T6.1 of the London Plan.",
    "During construction of the development hereby permitted, the trees located at 8 Fairlawns Close, Hornchurch shall not be lopped or felled without the written consent of the local planning authority.",
    "Reason: In order to maintain the existing vegetation at the site, which makes an important contribution to the character of the area, and to accord with Policy 27 of the Council's Local Plan.",
    "During construction of the development hereby permitted, any trees within or near to the site shall be protected in accordance with the requirements of BS 5837 (2012) 'Trees in Relation to Design, Demolition and Construction'.  The protection measures shall be implemented prior to any below ground works and shall be retained for the entire period of the duration of any work at the site, in connection with the development hereby permitted.",
    "Reason: In order to maintain the existing vegetation at the site, which makes an important contribution to the character of the area, and to accord with Policy 27 of the Council's Local Plan.",
