  "decision_conditions": [
    "The development to which this permission relates must be commenced not later than three years from the date of this permission.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To comply with the requirements of Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended by Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004).",
    "The development hereby permitted shall not be carried out otherwise than in complete accordance with the approved plans (as set out on page one of this decision notice).",
    "Reason:-",
    "For the avoidance of doubt and to ensure that the development is carried out as approved.",

    "a) A Phase I (Desktop Study) Report documenting the history of this site, its surrounding area and the likelihood of contaminant/s, their type and extent incorporating a Site Conceptual Model.",
    "b) A Phase II (Site Investigation) Report if the Phase I Report confirms the possibility of a significant risk to any sensitive receptors.  This is an intrusive site investigation including factors such as chemical testing, quantitative risk assessment and a description of the site ground conditions.  An updated Site Conceptual Model should be included showing all the potential pollutant linkages and an assessment of risk to identified receptors.",
    "c) A Phase III (Risk Management Strategy) Report if the Phase II Report",
    "All building operations in connection with the construction of external walls, roof, and foundations; site excavation or other external site works; works involving the use of plant or machinery; the erection of scaffolding; the delivery of materials; the removal of materials and spoil from the site, and the playing of amplified music shall only take place between the hours of 8.00am and 6.00pm Monday to Friday, and between 8.00am and 1.00pm on Saturdays and not at all on Sundays and Bank Holidays/Public Holidays, unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:-",

    "No works shall take place in relation to any of the development hereby approved until samples of the external finishing materials, are submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority and thereafter the development shall be constructed with the approved materials.",
    "Reason:-",

    "Before the building hereby permitted is first occupied, the area set aside for bicycle parking shall be built out and to the satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority and retained permanently thereafter for the accommodation of bicycles visiting the site and shall not be used for any other purpose.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To ensure that cycle parking is made permanently available for occupants and visitors, and in the interests of providing a wide range of facilities for non-motor car residents and sustainability.",
    "Before the building hereby permitted is first occupied, the area set aside for car parking shall be laid out and surfaced to the satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority and retained permanently thereafter for the accommodation of vehicles visiting the site and shall not be used for any other purpose.",
    "Reason:-",

    "Reason:-",
    "Any extension or alteration may impact the degree of openness of site and have a detrimental impact on the quality of living conditions for future occupants, and in the interests of amenity and to enable the Local Planning Authority to retain control over future development, and in order that the development accords with Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policy DC61.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: In accordance with paragraph 38 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2019, additional information on the impact of the proposals on the operation of the donor property were sought from the agent; who provided an additional amended design and access statement to address and overcome these concerns."
