    "The proposed building through the additions and alterations sought would through its overall height, bulk and mass, development footprint and design concept read as an unacceptably dominant and visually intrusive feature in both the street-scene and rear garden environment harmful to the appearance of the surrounding area and inconsistent and harmful to surrounding local character contrary to Policy D4 of the London Plan (2016), Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD. There would also be conflict with paragraph 127 of the National Planning Policy Framework (the Framework) which states that developments should function well, add to the overall quality of the area and be sympathetic to local character and the design principles set out within the Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD.",
    "The proposed development would through its scale, bulk and mass and proximity to shared boundaries - in particular the projection beyond the rear building line of the unattached neighbour to west, present as a wall of development and would form a visually intrusive and overbearing feature harmful to outlook, resulting in loss of light/overshadowing and harm to privacy to the detriment of the amenity of those occupiers. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD, the Residential Design SPD and the Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD. There would also be conflict with paragraph 127 of the National Planning Policy Framework which seeks to ensure a high standard of amenity for future users of development.",
    "The proposed development would fail to demonstrate an acceptable living environment for future occupants, through shortfalls in prescribed standards, low quality private amenity space and the absence of any communal space, factors which are conducive to a cramped overdevelopment of the site which would be detrimental to the amenity of future occupiers. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD, the Residential Design SPD and Policy D6 of the London Plan 2021. There would also be conflict with paragraph 127 of the National Planning Policy Framework which seeks to ensure a high standard of amenity for future users of development.",
    "The development would create an uplift in occupancy which would be out of keeping with the surrounding suburban context. This would present in increased comings and goings to the site which would be over and above what could be regarded as acceptable and would be detrimental to local character and the amenity of adjoining and nearby occupiers. This is evident in particular in the arrangement of vehicle parking to the site frontage and the close proximity to habitable rooms of the adjoining premises. The development would then be both detrimental to local character and the amenity of nearby occupiers contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD.",
    "The proposed car parking layout is designed in such a manor which would not allow sufficient visibility for emerging vehicles. The proposed development would, by reason of the inadequate sightlines present issues for highway safety and pedestrian comfort. As such the proposals do not make adequate provision for off-street parking and would be contrary to Policies DC32, DC33 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD and London Plan 2021 Policy T6.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to the agent in writing 13-07-20121",
    "In the event that this application is allowed through the appeals process the proposals would be liable for the following CIL contributions:",
    "The proposals would incur a Mayoral CIL contribution of £4,275 at a rate of £25 per sqm (171m² x 25).",
    "The proposal is also liable for the Havering Community Infrastructure Levy (HCIL), which has a charging rate of £125 per square metre of net additional floor space in Zone A. The Havering Community Infrastructure Levy contribution would equate to £21,375",
    "Each contribution would be subject to indexation."
