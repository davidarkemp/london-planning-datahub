    "The proposed dwelling by reason of its location and associated bulk, scale and massing in conjunction with the site constraints and its proximity to the side boundary, would form a conspicuous, a visually intrusive form of development and incongruent feature in the streetscene. The proposal is therefore contrary to paragraph 130 of the NPPF, London Plan policies D3 and Local Plan policies 10 and 26.",
    "The proposal would result in the unacceptable loss of garden space, light and outlook to No. 1 Cowper Road by reason of the location of the existing habitable room windows, result in a cramped over-development of the site, which would adversely impact on the living standards of the existing/future occupiers contrary to Local Plan policy 7 and paragraph 130 of the NPPF 2021.",
    "In the absence of a parking stress survey, it has not been demonstrated that an on-street parking  would be made available for the host property, as such the proposals would result in an unacceptable overspill onto the adjoining roads to the detriment of highway safety and residential amenity, contrary to Policy 24 of the Local Plan 2021.",
    "The proposal would be liable for contributions under CIL Regulations for both MCIL and HCIL based on any net increase in residential floor area. The liability would be considered further at Reserved Matters stage when the scale of development is known.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, it was necessary to issue a decision as close to the statutory timeframe as possible as opposed to seeking amendments which would have significantly delayed the application."
