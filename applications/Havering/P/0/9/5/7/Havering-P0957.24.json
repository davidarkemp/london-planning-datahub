    "The original dwelling entitled Flat 2 has a gross internal floor space of approximately 73 square metres, which fails to meet the standard of 120 square metres contrary to Policy 8 of the Havering Local Plan. The proposal would therefore have an adverse impact on the supply of family housing within the Borough, the loss of which is not adequately justified and which could set an undesirable precedent for similar development in the locality.",
    "There is insufficient evidence to clearly and robustly demonstrate that Flats 1 and 2 above the public house have been lawfully separated from the Durham Arms public house for a continuous period of at least ten years. In addition, there is insufficient justification that the loss of Flat 2 would not compromise the operation or viability of the public house use contrary to Policy 16 of the Havering Local Plan and Policies HC7 and S1 of the London Plan.",
    "The lack of communal amenity space is harmful to the amenity of the occupants of the HMO contrary to Policy 7 of the Havering Local Plan.",
    "There are insufficient dining facilities for the five occupiers of the HMO. The kitchen and living/dining room have a cumulative floor area of 16.7sqm on the first floor, which fails to provide adequate communal living/dining space for the occupiers of the HMO and provides a poor quality living environment harmful to the amenity of existing occupiers contrary to Policies 7 and 8 of the Havering Local Plan, the East London HMO Guidance and the guidance contained in the National Planning Policy Framework.",
    "The two person occupancy bedrooms each have a gross internal area of 12.4 square metres, which fails to meet the gross internal floor space of 13 square metres for two occupiers, which results in a poor quality living environment  harmful to the amenity of existing occupiers contrary to Policies 7 and 8 of the Havering Local Plan and the HMO East London Guidance.",
