    "The proposed development through the arrangement of built form and massing, relationship to shared boundaries and layout would present as visually cramped. This would be exacerbated by the massing of the dwellings and in doing so the proposals would neither reflect existing local character and patterns of development, nor introduce positive new character. The proposals would therefore be contrary to Policies 7, 10 and 26 of the Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 and also Paragraph 135 of the NPPF which amongst other considerations requires fundamentally that development add to the overall quality of the area whilst also establishing or maintaining a strong sense of place.",
    "The proposals through shallow plot depth and limited separation from shared boundaries would provide confined and enclosed private amenity areas within which outlook from internal and external spaces would be poor in particular for those dwellings not at either end of the terrace. These factors contribute to the development resulting in substandard residential accommodation to the detriment of the amenity of future occupiers and therefore contrary to the objectives of Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 Policy 7 and London Plan Policy D6. There would also be conflict with Paragraph 135 of the National Planning Policy Framework which seeks to ensure a high standard of amenity for existing and future occupiers.",
    "The proposed terraced row would present as visually dominant and overbearing from adjoining sites. Through limited plot depth, the scale bulk and mass of the dwellings proposed would form visually intrusive and overbearing features from adjoining sites, in particular 15 Grenfell Avenue and those dwellings fronting Upper Rainham Road. The proposed development would be harmful to amenity and enjoyment of these properties. The proposals are therefore contrary to Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 Policies 7, 26 and 34. There would also be conflict with Paragraph 135 of the National Planning Policy Framework which seeks to ensure a high standard of amenity for existing and future occupiers.",
