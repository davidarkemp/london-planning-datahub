    "The proposed part single, part two storey side/rear extension would, by reason of its excessive width, scale, bulk, and the inappropriate use of materials for the roof and rear dormer, would appear as a dominant and visually intrusive feature in the rear garden environment that would be harmful to the character and appearance of the host property and surrounding area, contrary to Local Plan Policies 7 and 26 and the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document.",
    "The proposed part single, part two storey side/rear extension would, by reason of its width, height and position close to the boundaries with the neighbouring properties nos. 18 and 22 Lytton Road, be an intrusive and unneighbourly development that would have an adverse effect on the amenity of these adjacent neighbouring occupiers in terms of overbearing impact, loss of outlook and an increased sense of enclosure, contrary to Local Plan Policy 7 and the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document.",
