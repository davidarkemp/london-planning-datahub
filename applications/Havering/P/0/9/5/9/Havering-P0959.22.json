    "The site is within the area identified in the Local Development Framework as Metropolitan Green Belt. Government Guidance as set out in the National Planning Policy Framework (Green Belts) states that in order to achieve the purposes of the Metropolitan Green Belt it is essential to retain and protect the existing rural character of the area so allocated and that new development will only be permitted outside the existing built up areas in the most exceptional circumstances. The development is inappropriate in principle in the Green Belt and no very special circumstances have been submitted in this case to outweigh the harm caused by reason of inappropriateness and visual harm to the character and openness of the Green Belt. The proposal is therefore contrary to paragraphs 130 and 149 of the NPPF, Local Plan policies 10 and 26 and London Plan policies D3 and G2.",
    "The proposed dwellings by reason of their location and associated height, bulk, scale and massing in conjunction with the associated areas of hard-surfacing, would form a conspicuous, a visually intrusive form of development and incongruent feature in the area and would result in urban sprawl and significantly harm the open character of the Green Belt at this point. The proposal is therefore contrary to paragraphs 130 and 149 of the NPPF, Local Plan policies 10 and 26 and London Plan policies D3 and G2.",
    "In the absence of a tree site survey and an arboricultural method statement it has not been demonstrated that trees of significant amenity value would be retained and that retained trees on adjoining land would be satisfactorily protected from construction impacts and site works during development stage. As such the proposals are contrary to Local Plan policy 27 and London Plan policy G7.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to the Agent by email on the 10/08/22."
