    "The proposals are not precise or definitive as to the proposed use of the site either individually or collectively as a whole including buildings and surrounding land etc. In the absence of any compelling evidence otherwise, officers consider that the nature and scale of activity would have the potential to be materially different from any historic use of the site in a manner inconsistent with the surrounding rural, Green Belt environment and thereby detrimental to local character contrary to Local Plan Policies 26, 34 and Paras 135 which requires development add to the overall quality of the area, establish or maintain a strong sense of place and Paragraph 143 specifically the purposes of including land within the Green Belt.",
    "The use of the site and buildings/individually or as a whole has not been demonstrated to be appropriate in character or scale to this rural location and proximity to neighbouring properties. Through a combination of the levels of potential activity, ambiguous character of activity, uncertainty over noise from comings/goings and in the absence of a compelling case otherwise the development is contrary to the objectives of Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 Policies 13 and 34 through being detrimental to the amenity of surrounding occupiers. There would also be conflict with the objectives of the NPPF, in particular Para 135 which requires development to provide a high standard of amenity for existing and future users and not undermine community cohesion.",
    "The use of the site and buildings/individually or as a whole collectively by reason of the physical character of the site, its rural location and ambiguous nature of the activities which may take place would in the absence of evidence otherwise lead to increased movement to and from this poorly accessible site in a manner which has not been adequately demonstrated not to be harmful to highway and pedestrian safety. The proposals are therefore be contrary to Policies 23 and 24 of the Havering Local Plan, Policy T6 of the London Plan, and to the objectives of the NPPF specifically Para 115.",
