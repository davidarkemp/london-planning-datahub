    "The development to which this permission relates must be commenced not later than three years from the date of this permission.",

    "Reason:-",
    "To safeguard the appearance of the premises and the character of the immediate area, and in order that the development accords with the Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policy DC61.",
    "The development hereby permitted shall not be carried out otherwise than in complete accordance with the approved plans (as set out on page one of this decision notice).",
    "Reason:-",
    "For the avoidance of doubt and to ensure that the development is carried out as approved.",

This is a matter of civil law between the two parties, and the Local Planning Authority are not involved in such matters.",
