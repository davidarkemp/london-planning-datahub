    "The development to which this permission relates must be commenced not later than three years from the date of this permission.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To comply with the requirements of Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended by Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004).",
    "The development hereby permitted shall not be carried out otherwise than in complete accordance with the approved plans (as set out on page one of this decision notice). The curtilage of the dwelling shall not exceed the areas shown on drawing 09 and demarcated in red.",
    "Reason:-",
    "The Local Planning Authority consider it essential that the whole of the development is carried out and that no departure whatsoever is made from the details approved, since the development would not necessarily be acceptable if partly carried out or carried out differently in any degree from the details submitted.",
    "No above ground works shall take place in relation to any of the development hereby approved until samples of all materials to be used in the external construction of the buildings are submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority and thereafter the development shall be constructed with the approved materials.",
    "Reason:-",
    "Insufficient information has been supplied with the application to judge the appropriateness of the materials to be used.  Submission of samples prior to commencement will ensure that the appearance of the proposed development will harmonise with the character of the surrounding area..",
    "Hard/soft landscaping shall be carried out strictly in accordance with the details shown on drawing no. BM/HR/01 Rev A unless otherwise agreed in writing and samples of all materials to be used shall be submitted to and agreed in writing prior to their use. All planting, seeding or turfing comprised within the scheme shall be carried out in the first planting season following completion of the development and any trees or plants which within a period of 5 years from completion of the development die, are removed or become seriously damaged or diseased shall be replaced in the next planting season with others of a similar size and species, unless otherwise agreed in writing by the local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To ensure that the development achieves a satisfactory level of landscape quality.",
    "Notwithstanding the details shown on submitted drawings no building shall be occupied or use commenced until refuse and recycling facilities are provided in accordance with details which shall previously have been submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority. The refuse and recycling facilities shall be permanently retained thereafter.",
    "Reason:-",
    "Insufficient information has been supplied with the application to judge how refuse and recycling will be managed on site.  Submission of this detail prior to occupation in the case of new building works or prior to the use commencing in the case of changes of use will protect the amenity of occupiers of the development and also the locality generally.",
    "Notwithstanding the details shown on submitted drawings  no building shall be occupied or use commenced until cycle storage is provided in accordance with details previously submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority. The cycle storage shall be permanently retained thereafter.",
    "Reason: Insufficient information has been supplied with the application to demonstrate what facilities will be available for cycle parking. Submission of this detail prior to occupation in the case of new building works or prior to the use commencing in the case of changes of use is in the interests of providing a wide range of facilities for non-motor car residents and sustainability.",
    "Notwithstanding the provisions of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 in accordance with the Order, no extension or enlargement (including additions to roofs) shall be made to the dwellinghouse(s) hereby permitted, or any detached building erected, or laying of additional areas of hard-standing (other than those agreed through the landscaping condition imposed) without the express permission in writing of the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:-",
    "In the interests of amenity and to enable the Local Planning Authority to retain control over future development.",
    "All hard surfaces hereby approved as part of the development (including any sub-base) shall be made of porous materials or provision shall be made to direct run-off water from the hard surface to a permeable or porous area or surface within the curtilage of the application site.",
    "Reason: In order to ensure no water run-off from the hard surface which would contribute to risk of flooding.",
    "Prior to first occupation of the development hereby approved, details of all proposed walls, fences and boundary treatment shall be submitted to, and approved in writing by, the Local Planning Authority.  To the rear of the proposed dwelling there shall be no close boarded fence and any hedgerow shall not exceed 1.50m in height. The boundary development shall then be carried out in accordance with the approved details and retained permanently thereafter to the satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:",
    "Insufficient information has been supplied with the application to judge the appropriateness of any boundary treatment.  Submission of this detail prior to commencement will protect the visual amenities of the development and prevent undue overlooking of adjoining property.",
    "All building operations in connection with the construction of external walls, roof, and foundations; site excavation or other external site works, including any works of demolition; works involving the use of plant or machinery; the erection of scaffolding; the delivery of materials; the removal of materials and spoil from the site, and the playing of amplified music shall only take place between the hours of 8.00am and 6.00pm Monday to Friday, and between 8.00am and 1.00pm on Saturdays and not at all on Sundays and Bank Holidays/Public Holidays.",
    "Reason: To protect residential amenity.",
    "Prior to the first occupation of the proposed dwelling hereby approved, the area set aside for car parking shall be laid out and surfaced to the satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority and retained permanently thereafter for the accommodation of vehicles visiting the site and shall not be used for any other purpose.",
    "Reason: To ensure that car parking accommodation is made permanently available to the standards adopted by the Local Planning Authority in the interest of highway safety, and that the development accords with Policy 24 of the Havering Local Plan.",
    "Building Regulations - All dwellings hereby approved shall be constructed to comply with Part M4(2) of the Building Regulations - Accessible and Adaptable Dwellings.",
    "Reason: In order to comply with Policy 7 of the Havering Local Plan and Policy D7 of the London Plan.",
    "Water efficiency - All dwellings hereby approved shall comply with Regulation 36 (2)(b) and Part G2 of the Building Regulations - Water Efficiency.",
    "Reason: In order to comply with Policy SI 5 of the London Plan..",
    "The combined site area (including that set aside for parking) of the dwelling and associated curtilage shall not exceed 296 square metres approx.",
    "Reason:-",
    "In the interests of  limiting impacts on the Metropolitan Green Belt and to enable the Local Planning Authority to retain control over future development.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: In accordance with paragraph 38 of the National Planning Policy Framework, improvements required to make the proposal acceptable were negotiated with the agent in writing. The revisions involved the drawing showing the proposed building in the context of the existing structures. Following this a drawing setting out the identifiable curtilage of the dwelling was provided 25-10-2022.",
    "The proposal is liable for the Mayor of London Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). The Mayoral CIL levy rate for Havering is 25/m² and is chargeable for each additional square metre of residential gross internal [floor] (GIA).  Based upon the information supplied with the application, £4,975 would be payable due to result in new properties with a combined gross internal floor area of 199m² of GIA, however this may be adjusted subject to indexation.",
    "The proposal is also liable for Havering Council's CIL. Havering's CIL charging rate for residential is £125m² (Zone A for each additional square metre of GIA. Based upon the information supplied with the application, £24,875 would be payable, subject to indexation.",
    "These charges are levied under s.206 of the Planning Act 2008.  CIL is payable within 60 days of commencement of development. A Liability Notice will be sent to the applicant (or anyone else who has assumed liability) shortly and you are required to notify the Council of the"
