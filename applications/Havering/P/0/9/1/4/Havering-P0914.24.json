    "The proposal would, by reason of the height, scale, bulk, design, fenestration, proportions and external materials of the proposed development appear incongruous and as an isolated and unrelated addition to the roofscape, that is also materially out of keeping with the character, appearance and proportions of this building of local heritage interest and is thereby detrimental to the character and quality of the locality, as well as harmful to this strategic arrival location within Romford, contrary to the provisions of Policies 26 and 28 of the Havering Local Plan 2016-2031, Policies D4 and HC1 of the London Plan and also the guidance within the NPPF.",
    "The proposed dwelling would by reason of their insufficient floor to ceiling height be inadequate resulting in substandard accommodation for future residents through lack of internal space contrary to Policy 7 of the Havering Local Plan and Policy D6 of the London Plan.",
    "The proposal, by reason of the reliance on single aspect units with poor outlook, poor quality access and servicing arrangements for residents and exposure to noise and disturbance would, in combination, result in a poor quality living environment for future occupiers of the proposed development, which would be contrary to the provisions of Policies 7 and 34 of the Havering Local Plan, Policies D6 and D14 of the London Plan 2021 and also the guidance within the NPPF.",
    "The proposal fails to demonstrate the site can suitably provide for cycle storage for the proposed flats, contrary to the provisions of Policy T5 of the London Plan and the Havering Local Plan.",

This charge has been levied under s.206 of the Planning Act 2008 and includes both the Mayor of London's CIL and Havering Council's CIL.",
