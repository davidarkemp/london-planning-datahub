  "description": "Two-storey side, single storey rear and single storey front extensions. New boundary fence",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed two storey side extension, by reason of its siting and close proximity to the side boundary with the public footway of Cambridge Avenue, would unacceptably reduce the open and spacious character of the streetscape and appear as an incongruous and somewhat overbearing feature when viewed from the public footway, contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD and the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document (Adopted 2011).",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: In accordance with paragraph 38 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2018, improvements required to make the proposal acceptable were negotiated with Mr Tony Martin (agent), via email.  The revisions involved providing a greater setback (predominantly 1m) for the proposed two storey side extension away from the public footway. The applicant declined to make the suggested revisions."
