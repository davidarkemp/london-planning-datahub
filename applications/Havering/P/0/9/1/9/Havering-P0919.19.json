  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed alterations and extensions, by reason of the scale, bulk and massing (especially at the third floor level) as well as its unsympathetic design, including the proposed materials, would not be subordinate to the host property and, would appear as unduly dominant, visually awkward and incongruous within this section of Market Place, resulting in unjustified harm to the setting of the adjacent Grade II listed Church House and the Grade II* listed St. Edward the Confessor's Church, and the special character and appearance of the Romford Conservation Area. The development is therefore contrary to the NPPF 2019, London Plan policies 7.4, 7.6 and 7.8 and policies DC61, DC67 & DC68 of the Local Development Framework Development Plan Document, and the Heritage Supplementary Planning Document.",
    "The proposal, if granted planning permission on appeal, would be liable for the Mayor of London and Havering Council's Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). Based upon the information supplied with the application, the CIL payable would be Â£35, 850.00. Further details with regard to CIL are available from the Council's website.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: The Local Planning Authority has worked with the applicant in a positive and pro-active manner by making available a free duty officer advice service, has provided written guidance and sought amendments to the proposal.  However, the guidance given has not been  adopted in this instance. The notification of intended refusal and the reasons for it was given to the agent Andrew Ransome, by email on 04/05/2020."
