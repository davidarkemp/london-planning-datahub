    "The development to which this permission relates must be commenced not later than three years from the date of this permission.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To comply with the requirements of Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended by Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004).",
    "The proposed development hereby approved shall be constructed in accordance with the materials detailed under materials section of the application form unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason: To ensure that the appearance of the proposed development will harmonise with the character of the surrounding area.",
    "The development hereby permitted shall not be carried out otherwise than in complete accordance with the approved plans (as set out on page one of this decision notice).",
    "Reason:-",
    "For the avoidance of doubt and to ensure that the development is carried out as approved.",
    "The extension hereby permitted shall be used only for living accommodation as an integral part of the existing dwelling known as No.7 Hubert Road, Rainham and shall not be used as a separate unit of residential accommodation at any time.",
    "Reason:-",
    "The site is within an area where the Local Planning Authority consider that the sub-division of existing properties should not be permitted in the interests of amenity.",
    "The proposed windows on the side and rear elevations adjacent to Nos.9 and 11 Hubert Road, Rainham serving the shower room, dining and kitchenette areas as shown on drawings 101 Revision 0 and 102 revision 0 shall be permanently glazed with obscure glass not less than level 4 on the standard scale of obscurity and shall thereafter be maintained and permanently fixed shut and thereafter maintained, with the exception of any top hung fanlight(s).",
    "Reason:-",
    "In the interests of privacy.",
    "Notwithstanding the provisions of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 2015, no window or other opening (other than those shown on the submitted and approved plan), shall be constructed or inserted in the walls of the building hereby permitted, unless specific permission under the provisions of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 has first been sought and obtained in writing from the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:-",
    "In order to ensure a satisfactory development that will not result in any loss of privacy or damage to the environment of neighbouring properties which exist or may be proposed in the future.",
    "The roof area of the extension hereby permitted shall not be used as a balcony, roof garden or similar amenity area without the grant of further specific permission from the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:-",
    "In the interests of the amenity of the occupiers of neighbouring dwelling.",
    "Prior to the commencement of any works pursuant to this permission the developer shall submit for the written approval of the Local Planning Authority;",
    "a)  A Phase I (Desktop Study) Report documenting the history of the site, its surrounding area and the likelihood of contaminant/s, their type and extent incorporating a Site Conceptual Model.",
    "b)  A Phase II (Site Investigation) Report if the Phase I Report confirms the possibility of a significant risk to any sensitive receptors.  This is an intrusive site investigation including factors such as chemical testing, quantitative risk assessment and a description of the sites ground conditions.  An updated Site Conceptual Model should be included showing all the potential pollutant linkages and an assessment of risk to identified receptors.",
    "c) A Phase III (Remediation Strategy) Report if the Phase II Report confirms the presence of a significant pollutant linkage requiring remediation.  A detailed remediation scheme to bring the site to",
    "a) If, during development, contamination not previously identified is found to be present at the site then no further development (unless otherwise agreed in writing with the local planning authority) shall be carried out until a",
    "remediation strategy detailing how this unsuspected contamination shall be dealt with has been submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority. The remediation strategy shall  be implemented as approved.",
    "b) Following completion of the remediation works as mentioned in (a) above, a 'Verification Report' must be submitted demonstrating that the works have been carried out satisfactorily and remediation targets have been achieved.",
    "Reason: To ensure that any previously unidentified contamination found at the site is investigated and satisfactorily addressed in order to protect those engaged in construction and occupation of the development from potential contamination.",
    "b. Upon completion of installation of the gas resistant membrane in compliance with BS 8485:2015, a 'Verification Report' must be submitted demonstrating that the works have been carried out.",
    "Reason:",
    "To protect the people on or close to the site from the risks associated with migrating landfill gas, and will ensure that the development accords with the Havering Local Plan.",
    "The annexe hereby permitted shall not be arranged or disposed of as a separate unit of residential accommodation from the use of the main dwelling.",
    "Reason:-",
    "In order that the annex approved remains ancillary to the main dwelling and that the development accords with the Havering Local Plan.",
    "The garden area shall not be sub-divided at any time.",
    "Reason:-",
    "In order that the annex approved remains ancillary to the main dwelling.",
    "Any residential occupation of the building hereby approved shall be limited to a close relative of the occupiers of the main dwelling and shall not be occupied by any other persons.",
    "Reason:-",
    "In order that the annex approved remains ancillary to the main dwelling.",
    "The development hereby approved shall be fitted with Ultra-Low NOx boilers with maximum NOx Emissions less than 40 mg/kWh. Where any installations do not meet this emissions standard it should not be operated without the fitting of suitable NOx abatement equipment or technology as determined by a specialist to ensure comparable emissions. The installation of the boilers shall be carried out in strict accordance with these details and shall thereafter be permanently retained.",
    "Reason: To minimise the impact of building emissions on local air quality.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35(2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management) Order 2015: No significant problems were identified during the consideration of the application, and therefore it has been determined in accordance with paragraph 38 of the National Planning Policy Framework."
