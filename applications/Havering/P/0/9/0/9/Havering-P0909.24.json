    "The proposed first floor rear extension would not comply with Council design guidance and would form a visually dominant and overbearing feature and one which would be detrimental to outlook of adjoining occupants (property subject of P0960.22) and their amenity more generally. As such the development would be contrary to Havering Local Plan Policies 7 and 26 of the Havering Local Plan.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to the agent in writing 23-08-2024",
    "The proposals would create an additional bedroom and would accordingly allow for greater levels of occupancy of the existing dwelling which is in use as a small HMO. Any uplift in occupancy would represent a material change of use to Sui Generis which has neither been sought, nor formed part of this current application."
