  "description": "Creation of a two storey 2 x bed dwelling to the side of no. 221 Highfield Road with associated parking, amenity space and cycle storage",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed development would, by reason of its design built at an angle and with an irregular shape, form an incongruous feature within the street scene resulting in a detrimental impact upon the wider visual appearance and character of the area, contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD, the Residential Design SPD and Policy 7.4 of the London Plan.",
    "The proposed development would, by reason of the inadequate provision and irregular shape of the internal living space, would result in a cramped over-development of the site to the detriment of future occupiers and the character of the surrounding area contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD.",
    "The proposed development would, by reason of the inadequate and ill-conceived car parking provision, insufficient cycle storage and lack of provision of bin storage, result in an unacceptable impact to the highway with the potential for overspill onto adjoining roads and would detrimentally impact future occupiers and surrounding residents, contrary to the Policy DC33 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD and Policy 6.13 of the London Plan.",
    "The proposal, if granted planning permission on appeal, would be liable for the Mayor of London Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and the Havering CIL. Based upon the information supplied with the application, the Mayoral CIL payable would be £1750 and the Havering CIL payable would be £8750. Further details with regard to CIL are available from the Council's website.",
    "It is noted that no CIL form was supplied with the planning application.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reasons for it was given to the agent via email."
