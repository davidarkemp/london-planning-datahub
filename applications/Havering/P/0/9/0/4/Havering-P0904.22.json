    "The cumulative impact of the proposed development and position close to the boundary of the site would harm outlook and appear dominant as well as being an intrusive and un-neighbourly development, which would have an adverse effect on the amenity of adjacent occupiers  at No. 45 Little Gaynes Lane, Upminster contrary to the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document and Policies 7 and 26 of the Local Plan.",
