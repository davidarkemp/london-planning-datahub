    "The proposed development hereby approved shall be constructed in accordance with the materials detailed under Section proposed materials of the application form unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason: To ensure that the appearance of the proposed development will harmonise with the character of the surrounding area.",
    "The development hereby permitted shall not be carried out otherwise than in complete accordance with the approved plans (as set out on page one of this decision notice).",
    "Reason:-",

    "Reason:-",

    "The garden area shall not be subdivided at any time and nor shall there be any additional pedestrian or vehicular accesses into the site.",
    "Reason:-",
    "In order that the annex approved remains ancillary to the main dwelling and that the development accords with Policy DC61 of the Development Control Policies",
    "Any residential occupation of the outbuilding hereby approved shall be limited to immediate family members of the family occupying the main house at 33 NEW ZEALAND WAY for residential purposes and shall not be occupied by any other persons.",
    "Reason:-",
