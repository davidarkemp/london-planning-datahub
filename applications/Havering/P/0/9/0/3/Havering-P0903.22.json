    "The proposed dwelling would, by reason of its cramped nature on an uncharacteristically small plot, its close proximity to the shared boundaries either side of the site and loss of landscaping, appear as a visually intrusive feature in the streetscene that would be harmful to the established local pattern of development along Philan Way. It would therefore be harmful to the character and appearance of the surrounding area contrary to Local Plan Policies 7 and 26.",
    "The proposed development would, by reason of its position close to the boundaries of the site and provision of a rear dormer, give rise to an intrusive and unneighbourly form of development through overlooking and loss of privacy, resulting in harm to the amenity of the occupiers of neighbouring properties nos. 3 Philan Way and 4 and 4a Belle Vue Road, contrary to the provisions of Local Plan Policies 7 and 10.",
    "The proposed development would, by reason of the low ceiling heights and absence of designated internal storage, result in a low quality design that would be to the detriment of future occupants, contrary to the provisions of Policy D6 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "In the event that this application is allowed through the appeals process, the proposals would be liable for the following CIL contributions:",
    "Mayoral CIL (MCIL2) contribution of £1,425 (x £25 per sqm).",
    "Havering CIL (HCIL) contribution of £7,125 (x £125 per sqm)",
    "Each contribution would be subject to indexation.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal was given to the agent via email on 9th August 2022."
