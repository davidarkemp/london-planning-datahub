    "The paving by reason of its overall expanse, combined with very limited soft landscaping, sets an undesirable precedent and is detrimental to the open and verdant character of the Gidea Park Conservation Area and neither preserves or enhances the character and appearance of the Gidea Park Conservation Area contrary to Policy 28 of the Havering Local Plan (2016-2031), the Heritage Supplementary Planning Document, Policy HC1 of the London Plan and the guidance contained within the National Planning Policy Framework.",
    "The canopy, by reason of its excessive depth, scale, materiality, siting and proximity to the boundaries of the site, lacks subservience to the existing dwelling, appears incongruous, dominant and visually intrusive and results in an unsympathetic built form in the rear garden environment and combined with the extensive hardstanding area, are materially harmful to the character and appearance of this Exhibition property and the Gidea Park Conservation Area contrary to Policy 28 of the Havering Local Plan (2016-2031), the Heritage Supplementary Planning Document, the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document, Policy HC1 of the London Plan and the guidance contained within the National Planning Policy Framework.",
