    "The development to which this permission relates must be commenced not later than three years from the date of this permission.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To comply with the requirements of Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended by Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004).",
    "The development hereby permitted shall not be carried out otherwise than in complete accordance with the approved plans (as set out on page one of this decision notice).",
    "Reason:-",
    "For the avoidance of doubt and to ensure that the development is carried out as approved.",
    "The 2x Kelvion Gas coolers are not to exceed a noise rating of 40 dBa at 10m  at all times of the day. The 2x refrigeration pack (ref: LT/IT-1 and LT/IT-2) are not to exceed a noise rating of 45 dBa at 10m  at all times of the day",
    "Reason:- To protect neighbouring amenity, in accordance with Policy 7 of the Havering Local Plan",
    "No above ground works shall take place in relation to any of the development hereby",
    "approved until samples of all materials to be used in the external construction of the",
    "building(s) are submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority and",
    "thereafter the development shall be constructed with the approved materials.",
    "Reason:- Insufficient information has been supplied with the application to judge the",
    "appropriateness of the materials to be used. Submission of samples prior to",
    "commencement will ensure that the appearance of the proposed development will",
    "harmonise with the character of the surrounding area.",
    "All building operations in connection with the construction of external walls, roof, and foundations; site excavation or other external site works; works involving the use of plant or machinery; the erection of scaffolding; the delivery of materials; the removal of materials and spoil from the site, and the playing of amplified music shall only take place between the hours of 8.00am and 6.00pm Monday to Friday, and between 8.00am and 1.00pm on Saturdays and not at all on Sundays and Bank Holidays/Public Holidays.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To protect residential amenity.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35(2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management) Order 2015: No significant problems were identified during the consideration of the application, and therefore it has been determined in accordance with paragraph 38 of the National Planning Policy Framework."
