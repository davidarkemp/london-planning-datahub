    "Insufficient information has been provided over the scale of the proposed business operation. As such an in the absence of clarification the proposed business use would be likely to result in unacceptable impact on the amenity of adjoining occupiers in a residential area as a result of increased activities associated with the use by coming and going of patrons and parking of vehicles contrary to policy DC61 of the Havering Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD 2008.",
    "The proposed business use would - by reason of the inadequate on site car parking provision and lack of compelling evidence to the contrary would hold the potential to result in unacceptable impact on the safe operation of the highway and neighbouring properties, as well as residential amenity and would be contrary and policies DC33 of the of the Havering Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD 2008.",
    "The changes to the building to facilitate the conversion result in adverse impacts to the street-scene and local character. The outbuilding would read independently of the main dwelling and given its commercial use would be entirely at odds with the existing urban environment therefore contrary to DC61 of the Havering Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD 2008 and the objectives of the NPPF and London Plan 2021.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, officers considered it necessary and expedient to issue a decision within the statutory timeframes."
