    "No works shall take place in relation to any of the development hereby approved until samples of the external finishing materials, which shall match those of the existing surrounding building(s) are submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority and thereafter the development shall be constructed with the approved materials.",
    "Reason:-",
    "Insufficient information has been supplied with the application to judge the appropriateness of the external finishing materials to be used.  Submission of samples prior to commencement will safeguard the appearance of the premises and the character of the immediate area.",
    "Notwithstanding the provisions of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015, no extension or enlargement (including additions to roofs) shall be made to the dwellinghouse(s) hereby permitted, or any detached building erected, without the express permission in writing of the Local Planning Authority.",

    "In the interests of amenity and to enable the Local Planning Authority to retain control over future development.",
    "No building shall be occupied until refuse and recycling facilities are provided in accordance with details which shall previously have been submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority. The refuse and recycling facilities shall be permanently retained thereafter.",
    "Reason:-",
    "Insufficient information has been supplied with the application to judge how refuse and recycling will be managed on site.  Submission of this detail prior to occupation in the case of new building works or prior to the use commencing in the case of changes of use will protect the amenity of occupiers of the development and also the locality generally.",

    "Reason:-",
    "Insufficient information has been supplied with the application to demonstrate what facilities will be available for cycle parking.  Submission of this detail prior to occupation in the case of new building works or prior to the use commencing in the case of changes of use is in the interests of providing a wide range of facilities for non-motor car residents and sustainability.",

    "The proposed side dormer windows for a bathroom and hall/stairwell area facing no. 126 Haynes Road shall be permanently glazed with obscure glass not less than Level 4 on the standard scale of obscurity and shall thereafter be maintained and permanently fixed shut, with the exception of any top hung fanlight(s).",

    "In the interests of privacy, and in order that the development accords with Policy 7 of the Local Plan 2021.",
    "The roof area of the extension hereby permitted shall not be used as a balcony, roof garden or similar amenity area without the grant of further specific permission from the Local Planning Authority.",

    "Prior to the first occupation of the development, details shall be submitted to and agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority for the installation of Ultra-Low NOx boilers with maximum NOx Emissions less than 40 mg/kWh. Where any installations do not meet this emissions standard it should not be operated without the fitting of suitable NOx abatement equipment or technology as determined by a specialist to ensure comparable emissions. The installation of the boilers shall be carried out in strict accordance with the agreed details and shall thereafter be permanently retained.",
    "Reason: To minimise the impact of building emissions on local air quality in accordance with Policy 33 of the Local Plan 2021.",
    "The proposal is liable for the Mayor of London Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). The Mayoral CIL levy rate for Havering is Â£25/sqm and is chargeable for each additional square metre of residential gross internal [floor] (GIA).  Based upon the information supplied with the application, Â£2,575 would be payable due to result in a new residential property with 103 sqm of GIA, however this may be adjusted subject to indexation.",
    "The proposal is also liable for Havering Council's CIL. Havering's CIL charging rate for residential is Â£125/sqm (Zone A) for each additional square metre of GIA. Based upon the information supplied with the application, Â£12,875 would be payable, subject to indexation.",
    "The total amount of CIL owed amounts to Â£15,450, subject to indexation.",
