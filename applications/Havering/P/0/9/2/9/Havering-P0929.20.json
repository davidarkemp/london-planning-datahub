    "The proposed extension incorporating the roof alteration would, by reason of its design and excessive width further unbalance the appearance of this semi-detached dwelling and appear as an unacceptably dominant and visually intrusive feature thereby harming the visual amenity and character of the host property and surrounding area contrary to guidance set out in the Supplementary Design Guidance and Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: In accordance with paragraph 38 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2019, improvements required to make the proposal acceptable were negotiated with the agent of the applicant.  The revisions involved omission of the front entrance porch and reduction in the design and bulk of the side extension. The applicant amended the scheme with removal of the front porch however, they did not take full account of the requested revision."
