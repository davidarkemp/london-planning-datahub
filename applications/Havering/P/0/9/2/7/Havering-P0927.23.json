    "The proposed roof alterations by reason of their bulk, mass and design would give rise to a top heavy and visually dominant form of development that is out of character with the wider streetscene and would appear as visually intrusive and incongruous development.  Furthermore, viewed cumulatively with the large rear dormer and the roof over the first floor rear addition, would give rise to an uncharacteristically bulky and visually intrusive form of development at roof level, which is harmful to the character and appearance of the rear garden environment and thereby detrimental to neighbouring residential amenity,  contrary to Policies 7 and 26 of the Havering Local Plan and Havering's Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD.",
