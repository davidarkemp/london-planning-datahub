  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed development would, by reason of introducing uncharacteristically and disproportional over sized building containing a separate self-contained dwelling in the rear garden would,  result in a level of comings and goings and noises and potentially cooking smells that would not be expected in the rear garden and would negatively impact all surrounding neighbours including nos. 11, 12, 13 and 14 Blewitts Cottages, New Road and no. 2A Dunedin Road, contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD.",
    "The proposed new dwelling located in the rear garden of no. 2A Dunedin Road and with no street frontage, would by reason of its bulk, mass and siting, represent an overdevelopment of the rear garden environment which is inconsistent with the prevailing open character of the rear garden scene and pattern of development, contrary to policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD.",
    "The proposed development would, by reason of insufficient provision of private outdoor amenity space for both the donor property and the new dwelling as well as overlooking and loss of privacy, would be at the detriment of occupiers at no. 2A Dunedin Road and the future occupiers of the new dwelling, contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD .",
    "The proposal, if granted planning permission on appeal, would be liable for the Mayor of London Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and Havering Community Infrastructure Levy (HCIL). Based upon the information supplied with the application, the total CIL payable would be Â£7500. CIL amounts are subject to indexation. Further details with regard to CIL are available from the Council's website.",
