    "The first floor side extension and loft conversion,by reason of its design, crown roof form, appearance of the dormers and massing, would not satisfactorily integrate with the host building, thereby it would compromise the architectural composition of the building and hence it is considered to be harmful to the character and appearance of the street scene and Gidea Park Conservation Area, contrary to Policies 7, 26 & 28 of the Havering Local Plan Adopted November 2021, and the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document Adopted 2011.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy which would require significant alteration to overcome, amendments were not sought in this case."
