    "The development to which this permission relates must be commenced not later than three years from the date of this permission.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To comply with the requirements of Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended by Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004).",
    "All new external finishes shall be carried out in materials shown on the plans and application form.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To safeguard the appearance of the premises and the character of the immediate area.",
    "The development hereby permitted shall not be carried out otherwise than in complete accordance with the approved plans (as set out on page one of this decision notice).",
    "Reason:-",
    "For the avoidance of doubt and to ensure that the development is carried out as approved.",
    "Notwithstanding the provisions of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015, no window or other opening (other than those shown on the submitted and approved plan,) shall be formed in the flank wall(s) of the building(s) hereby permitted, unless specific permission under the provisions of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 has first been sought and obtained in writing from the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:-",
    "In order to ensure a satisfactory development that will not result in any loss of privacy or damage to the environment of neighbouring properties which exist or may be proposed in the future.",
    "The outbuilding hereby permitted shall be used only for living accommodation as an integral part of the existing dwelling known as 252 Osborne Road, Hornchurch and shall not be used as a separate unit of residential accommodation at any time.",
    "Reason:-",
    "The site is within an area where the Local Planning Authority consider that the sub-division of existing properties should not be permitted in the interests of amenity.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: In accordance with paragraph 38 of the National Planning Policy Framework, improvements required to make the proposal acceptable were negotiated with Mark Breden via email on 18.8.23.  The revisions involved a reduction in the depth of the outbuilding. The amendments were subsequently submitted on 22.8.23."
