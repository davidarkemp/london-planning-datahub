    "The proposal would, by reason of the materials, bulk and mass, be visually intrusive and harmful to the character and appearance of this heritage asset as well as the street and garden scene generally and would fail to preserve or enhance the Gidea Park Conservation Area contrary to Policies 26 and 28 of the adopted Havering Local Plan and the Heritage Supplementary Planning Document and the NPPF.  Section 72 (1) of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 is relevant. Regarding the NPPF, a low level of less than substantial harm to the significance of the Conservation Area is envisaged.  The rear proposed extension and roof changes would adversely affect the architectural interest of a non-designated heritage asset, which makes the application subject to Paragraph 209 of the NPPF.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, it was necessary to issue a decision as close to the statutory timeframe as possible as opposed to seeking amendments which would have significantly delayed the application."
