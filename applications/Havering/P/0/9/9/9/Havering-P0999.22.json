    "The proposed development would, by reason of its height, bulk and mass, appear as an unacceptably dominant and visually intrusive feature in the streetscene harmful to the appearance of the surrounding area contrary to Policies 7, and 26 of the Havering Local Plan, and the Emerson Park Policy Area Supplementary Planning Document",
    "The proposal development would, by reason of its excessive depth and height, result in an unsatisfactory relationship between building blocks leading to loss of outlook to the detriment of the amenity of adjacent occupiers, contrary to Policy 7 of the Havering Local Plan.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reasons for it was given to the agent via email.",
    "For Residential Development Only",
    "Please be advised that approval of this application from 1st September 2019 (either by London Borough of Havering, or subsequently by PINS if allowed on appeal following a refusal by London Borough of Havering) will attract a liability payment of £62,250 plus indexation. This charge has been levied under s.206 of the Planning Act 2008 and includes both the Mayor of London's CIL and Havering Council's CIL.",
    "This figure is based on the Mayoral CIL levy rate for Havering of £25/sq.m plus Havering's charging rate for residential of £125/sq.m (Zone A), and the net additional gross internal floorspace of 415 square metres.",
    "London Borough of Havering, as CIL collecting authority, has responsibility for the collection of the Mayoral CIL, in addition to Havering's CIL, on commencement of the development.",
    "You are advised to visit the planning portal website where you can download the appropriate document templates.",
