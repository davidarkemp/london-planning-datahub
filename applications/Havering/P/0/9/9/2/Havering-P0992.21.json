    "Insufficient justification has been provided as to the current condition of the windows, whether repair/refurbishment would be possible together with secondary glazing as a possible alternative. The removal of all historic frames and glass panes would cause harm to the historic and architectural significance of the property. The proposed replacement windows would introduce a discernibly modern double-glazed appearance with double image reflections, which would materially and unacceptably detract from the character and appearance of the application premises, to the detriment of the street-scene. The proposal would neither preserve, nor enhance the special character of the Gidea Park Conservation Area and is therefore contrary to Policies DC61 and DC68 of the Local Development Framework Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document, Policies 26 and 28 of the Proposed Submission Havering Local Plan and Policy HC1 of the London Plan.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to AVA Design and Planning via email on 19th October 2021."
