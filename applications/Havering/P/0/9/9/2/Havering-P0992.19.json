    "The  raised decking adjacent to the swimming pool at the bottom of the garden, by reason of its, height, position and proximity to neighbouring properties is concidered to give rise to overlooking and loss of privacy which would have a serious and adverse effect on the living conditions of adjacent occupiers and which can not be satisfactorily resolved by the applicants proposed alterations to the as-built development.  The development is therefore considered to be contrary to the Residential Extension and Alteration Supplementary Planning Document and Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document.",
