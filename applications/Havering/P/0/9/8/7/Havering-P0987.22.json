    "The proposed rear extensions would, by reason of their excessive depth, bulk and position close to the boundaries of the site, would form a dominant and intrusive feature detrimental to the character and appearance of the host property and visual amenity of the locality as well as having an overbearing impact and loss of outlook to the detriment of the amenity of the occupiers of Nos. 35 and 37 Trustons Gardens contrary to the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document, policies D1, D3 and D4 of The London Plan (2021) and Policies 26 and 7 of the Local Plan.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, it was necessary to issue a decision as close to the statutory timeframe as possible as opposed to seeking amendments which would have significantly delayed the application."
