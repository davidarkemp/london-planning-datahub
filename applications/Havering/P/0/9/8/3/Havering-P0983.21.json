  "decision_conditions": [
    "The development to which this permission relates must be commenced not later than three years from the date of this permission.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To comply with the requirements of Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended by Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004).",
    "The proposed development hereby approved shall be constructed in accordance with the materials detailed under Section 8 of the application form unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason: To ensure that the appearance of the proposed development will harmonise with the character of the surrounding area and comply with Policy DC61 of the Development Control Policies Development Plan Document",
    "The development hereby permitted shall not be carried out otherwise than in complete accordance with the approved plans, particulars and specifications.",
    "Reason:-",
    "The Local Planning Authority consider it essential that the whole of the development is carried out and that no departure whatsoever is made from the details approved, since the development would not necessarily be acceptable if partly carried out or carried out differently in any degree from the details submitted.  Also, in order that the development accords with Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policy DC61.",
    "Notwithstanding the provisions of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 the outbuilding hereby permitted shall be used only for purposes incidental to the enjoyment of the dwelling house and not for any trade or business nor as living accommodation.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To restrict the use to one compatible with a residential area, and in order that the development accords with Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policy DC61.",
    "For any development where a flood risk is identified, the Council as the Lead Local Flood Authority want to see developers consider and implement flood resilience/resistance measures into the buildings themselves. This is not to stop development but to ensure the protection for future residents is maintained and enhanced.",
    "The following measures are strongly recommended, although this list is not exhaustive:-",
    "-         Raising the level of the building by at least 300mm above local levels;",
    "-         Waterproof membrane in the ground floor;",
    "-         Waterproof plaster and waterproofing to ground floor;",
    "-         Electrics from the upstairs down and sockets high up off the ground floor;",
    "-         Non return valves on the sewerage pipes;",
    "-         Emergency escape plan for each individual property;",
    "-         Air brick covers; and",
    "-         Movable flood barriers for entrances",
    "Statement Required by Article 35(2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management) Order 2015: No significant problems were identified during the consideration of the application, and therefore it has been determined in accordance with paragraph 38 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2018."
