    "The cumulative impact of extending the hours of the proposed use of the premises would be likely to result in a greater degree of coming and goings at the quieter period of time in location surrounded by domestic neighbouring buildings. Consequently, inevitability the proposal would result in an unacceptable levels of noise and disturbance to the amenities of such occupiers at the time when the nearby residential occupiers expect a degree of calm and tranquillity. The noise and the associated disturbance would be further aggravated when the existing car parks continue to be used by the patron late in the evening and in the early hours of the morning in which case, there would be additional noise and light pollution associated with vehicles manoeuvring, harmful to the residential amenity of neighbouring properties contrary to Policies 7 and 34 of the Local Plan 2021."
