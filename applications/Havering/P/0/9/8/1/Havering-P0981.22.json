    "The proposed development, in particular the single storey rear extension by reason of its excessive depth and proximity to the boundary, would  have an adverse effect on the amenity of the attached neighbour (No. 4 Melstock Avenue) resulting in a significant loss of outlook and an increased sense of enclosure, contrary to the Supplementary Design Guidance (Residential Extensions and Alterations) and Policy 7 of the Local Plan.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, it was necessary to issue a decision as close to the statutory timeframe as possible as opposed to seeking amendments which would have significantly delayed the application."
