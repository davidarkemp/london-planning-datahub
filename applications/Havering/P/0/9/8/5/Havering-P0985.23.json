    "The proposals to extend and convert the existing large family dwellinghouse with an original floorspace of more than 120sqm would be unacceptable in principle as it would result in the loss of a family sized dwelling where there is a recognised shortage of family accommodation in the Borough,  with no reprovision of a similar existing larger unit on site. The proposals would undermine the objective of ensuring mixed and balanced communities contrary to Local Plan policy 9.",
    "The proposed rear dormer and hip to gable roof extensions would, by reason of their bulk and mass close to the boundaries of the site, appear as an unacceptably dominant and visually intrusive feature in the streetscene and rear garden environment, harmful to the appearance of the host property, symmetry of this pair of semis and the prevailing pattern of development in the surrounding area contrary to Policy 7 and 26 of the Havering Local Plan and the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document 2011.",
    "The proposed rear step access, would be out of character within the gardenscene, resulting in potential loss of privacy to the nearby occupiers. The lack of private amenity space to the units, basement living space and poor level of outlook to some habitable rooms, would create constrained and sub-standard residential accommodation to the detriment of the amenity of future occupiers, contrary to the aims and objectives of London Plan Policy D6 and Policies 7 and 9 of the Local Plan 2021 and the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document 2011.",
    "In the absence of a full Tree Survey, the proposed development would result in the removal and/or harm to trees on site, which would be materially harmful to the character and amenity of site and surrounding area, contrary to Policy 27 of the Local Plan 2021, the Protection of Trees during Development Supplementary Planning Document and NPPF 2021.",
    "The proposal, if granted planning permission on appeal, would be liable for both the Mayor of London Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and the Havering Council's Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) . Based upon the information supplied with the application, the CIL payable would be a total £10,800.00. Further details with regard to CIL are available from the Council's website.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, it was necessary to issue a decision as close to the statutory timeframe as possible as opposed to seeking amendments which would have significantly delayed the application."
