    "The proposed office block would, by reason of its height and design with particular regard to the void created by the undercroft parking area give rise to a building that will be a visually intrusive feature in the streetscene.  Because of this, Council considers that the proposed building would be harmful to the surrounding area and special character of the Gidea Park Conservation Area.   The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies DC61 and DC68 and it is recommended that planning permission be refused.",
    "The drawings submitted as part of the application lack sufficient detail and accuracy such that Council are unable to fully assess the impacts that building will have upon the character of the area and the acceptability of the quality of the finish of the building.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason for it was given to the agent, via telephone on 16/8/19.",
    "The proposal, if granted planning permission on appeal, would be liable for the Mayor of London Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). Based upon the information supplied with the application, the CIL payable would be Â£4654.00. Further details with regard to CIL are available from the Council's website."
