  "description": "Demolition of existing dwelling at 115C Victoria Road and existing storage building and erection of detached two storey building to create one self-contained one bedroom flat and a 7 bedroom HMO with associated cycle parking and amenity space",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed flat (No. 115C Victoria Road) and HMO would, by reason of their layout, siting and proximity to the south western boundary of the site, overlook and have a sole outlook onto the adjoining site and as such, prejudice the development potential of the Midland Court office development, including No.'s 3-6, contrary to Policy DC61 of Local Development Framework Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document.",
    "The proposal, by reason of a lack of an outdoor private amenity area for the proposed self-contained one bedroom flat would be harmful to the amenity of future occupiers of No. 115C Victoria Road contrary to Policy DC61 of the Local Development Framework Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document and the Design for Living Supplementary Planning Document.",
    "The shared amenity space for the proposed self-contained one bedroom flat and 7 bedroom HMO is of poor quality and usability, given its limited depth, northern orientation, it would be overshadowed by the mature trees, enclosed by the elevated railway embankment; would result in undue overlooking and loss of privacy to Room  1 and is not accessible to 115C Victoria Road harmful to the amenity of future occupiers and contrary to Policy DC61 of Local Development Framework Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document and the Design for Living Residential Design Supplementary Planning Document.",
    "The proposed layout of the development , including the long recessed walkway to the HMO, would be inadequate resulting in substandard accommodation for future residents, prevent natural surveillance opportunities and is a potential crime generator for anti-social behaviour activities and would result in undue noise and disturbance harmful to the future occupiers of the proposed self-contained flat (115C Victoria Road), contrary to Policies DC3, DC61 and DC63 of the Local Development Framework Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document and London Plan Policy 7.3.",
    "The proposal, by reason of the proposed layout and access arrangements, would be an unneighbourly development and adversely impact on the residential amenity of adjacent occupiers, including undue overlooking and loss of privacy contrary to Policy DC61 of the Local Development Framework Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document.",
    "The proposed 7 room HMO would result in an intensification of the site and result in significant harm to residential amenity from noise, disturbance and activity, contrary to Policies DC4, DC5 and DC61 of the Local Development Framework Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to 4d Planning via email on 23rd September 2020.",
    "For Residential Development Only",
    "Please be advised that approval of this application from 1st September 2019 (either by London Borough of Havering, or subsequently by PINS if allowed on appeal following a refusal by London Borough of Havering) will attract a liability payment of £22,200 ¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿plus indexation in Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This charge has been levied under s.206 of the Planning Act 2008 and includes both the Mayor of London's CIL and Havering Council's CIL.",
    "London Borough of Havering, as CIL collecting authority, has responsibility for the collection of the Mayoral CIL, in addition to Havering's CIL, on commencement of the development.",
    "Your proposal is subject to a CIL Liability Notice indicating a levy of £3,700 plus indexation for the application, based on the Mayoral CIL levy rate for Havering of ¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿£25/sq.m plus Havering's charging rate for residential of ¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿£125/sq.m (Zone A) and the floorspace of 148 square metres.",
