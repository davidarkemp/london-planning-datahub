    "The proposed development by reason of its excessive bulk, scale and size, would be incongruous in the rear garden scene and would be harmful to the character of the original house and surrounding area, contrary to Havering's Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD (adopted 2011), and Policy DC61 of the Core Strategy and Development Control DPD (adopted 2008).",
    "The proposed first floor rear extension would, by reason of its location on the boundary with the attached neighbour with no setback, would have significant and undue amenity impacts to the rear bedroom window of no. 8 Babington Road resulting in a sense of enclosure, overbearing development, loss of access to sunlight/daylight and overshadowing that is intrusive and unneighbourly, contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD and Havering's Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document (adopted 2011).",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal for it was given to Mr Devrim Sahin (agent), via email on 26 August 2020."
