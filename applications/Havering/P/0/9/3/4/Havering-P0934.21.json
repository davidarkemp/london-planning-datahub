    "The proposed development would not be subservient to the roof of the property, would alter the basic shape of the roof on the semi-detached house which is unacceptable as it leads to an imbalance between the pair and creates a visually heavy roof to one half causing a negative effect on the street scene by the loss of symmetry. Accordingly the proposal is of a poor quality design which is contrary to the purposes and intent of Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document, the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document and Policy D4 of the London Plan.",
