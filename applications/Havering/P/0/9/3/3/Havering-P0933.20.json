    "The proposed extensions and alterations would, in particular with respect to the roof alterations by significantly raising the ridge and incorporating a bulky dormer window to the rear would appear an incongruous feature which would be visually intrusive, would not be in keeping with the character of the area and would be harmful to the rear garden environment of the adjoining neighbours and hence it would be contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document, the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document and Policy 7.4 of the London Plan.",
