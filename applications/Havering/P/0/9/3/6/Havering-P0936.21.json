    "The proposed development would, by reason of its position and proximity to neighbouring properties cause overlooking and loss of privacy which would have a serious and adverse effect on the living conditions of adjacent occupiers, contrary to Local Plan Policies 7 and 26",
    "The proposed front dwellings, by reason of their detailed design, scale and width, appear would appear out of proportion to the surrounding properties and would not respect, reinforce or complement the front streetscene contrary to Local Plan policy 26.",
    "The proposed rear block due to its excessive height, scale, bulk and massing would not appear subordinate or appropriate in this backland setting and would appear cramped in the plot and particularly prominent and overbearing when viewed from the rear of No's 27-37 Morant Gardens, No's 318 and 320 Lodge Lane and the adjoining Green Belt.",
    "The development would fail to enhance the character of the area or create a positive sense of place and be harmful to the setting of the adjoining Green Belt contrary to Local Plan Policies 7 and 26, London Plan policies D4 and G2, and paragraph 134 of the NPPF.",
    "In the absence of a daylight and sunlight and overshadowing assessment to demonstrate otherwise the proposals would have a detrimental impact on the rear residential gardens of No's 318 and 320 Lodge Lane by reason of overshadowing these amenity spaces contrary to Local Plan Policies 7 and 26.",
    "The proposals would fail to provide a policy compliant balanced dwelling mix and would fail to provide communal space for all dwellings contrary to Local Plan policies 5 and 7.",
    "The proposal, if granted planning permission on appeal, would be liable for the Mayor of London and Havering Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL).The proposal is liable for LB Havering CIL and will incur a charge of £77,00 (subject to indexation) based on the calculation of £125.00 per square metre. The proposal is also liable for Mayoral CIL and will incur a charge of £15,400 (subject to indexation) based on the calculation of £25.00 per square metre.",
