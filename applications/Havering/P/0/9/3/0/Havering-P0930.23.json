    "The proposed dwellings, through their siting, scale, bulk and mass, would close down and overwhelm the spacious corner location and would therefore appear as an overbearing, cramped form of development within the locality. This, together with having widths that would be narrower than that of the donor neighbouring dwellings, would give rise to developments that would appear as incongruous, visually intrusive and out of character with the prevailing pattern of development. The proposed development would therefore be contrary to Policies 10, 7 and 26 of the Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 and also Paragraph 130(a) of the NPPF which requires fundamentally that development add to the overall quality of the area whilst also establishing or maintaining a strong sense of place.",
