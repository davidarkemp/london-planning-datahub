    "The development to which this permission relates must be commenced not later than three years from the date of this permission.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To comply with the requirements of Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended by Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004).",
    "The development hereby permitted shall not be carried out otherwise than in complete accordance with the approved plans (as set out on page one of this decision notice).",
    "Reason: For the avoidance of doubt and to ensure that the development is carried out as approved.",
    "The proposed boundary treatment shall comprise of metal hoop top railings painted/finished Green RAL 6005 unless otherwise agreed in writing with the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason: To ensure the appropriateness of the finished development and to esure that it would harmonise with the character of the surrounding area.",
    "All works shall be carried strictly in accordance with the methodology set out in the Arboricultural Method Statement by Arbtech dated 21 November 2023 and tree protection measures shall be established and maintained throughout the course of development as shown on the Tree Protection Plan (Arbtech TPP 01).",
    "Reason: To ensure that existing planting and landscaping is retained.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35(2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management) Order 2015: No significant problems were identified during the consideration of the application, and therefore it has been determined in accordance with paragraph 38 of the National Planning Policy Framework.",
    "Whilst the assessment undertaken as part of this submission finds the area of the site to which the permission relates to be of low ecological value, this does not discharge the applicant from responsibilities under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 the contravention of which is a criminal offence.",
    "Precautionary advice for birds",
    "Birds are legally protected during the breeding season and need to be considered in respect of any impact from the proposed work. Work involving vegetation clearance must take place outside the optimum breeding season (March to August inclusive), unless it can be confirmed there are no breeding birds in the proposed work area. Note that birds frequently nest outside of the optimum period, particularly during spells of milder weather. It should never be assumed work can always take place without prior investigation.",
    "Birds generally tend to nest in dense shrub beds and mature trees. Where such vegetation may be affected by the proposed work it will require inspection for nesting birds. For example, but not exclusively, blackbird, dunnock, robin, blue and great tit, pigeons, magpies and crows.",
    "When reinstating vegetation and hardstand following building, install permeable surfaces, water butts and rain gardens. Plant a diverse mix of trees, shrubs and her"
