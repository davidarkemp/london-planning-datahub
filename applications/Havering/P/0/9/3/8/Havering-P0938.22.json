    "The proposed development would, by reason of its bulk and mass, appear as an unacceptably dominant and visually intrusive feature in the gardenscene harmful to the appearance of the site and surrounding area and harming the Garden Suburb character of the Conservation Area . By reason of its design and appearance, including use of inappropriate substantial glazed material to the single storey rear projection, the proposal is considered to be an unsympathetic form of development within the Conservation Area, failing to preserve or enhance the special character of this part of the Gidea Park Conservation Area contrary to the NPPF 2021, London Plan Policy HC1, Core Strategy Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policies 7, 26, 27 and 28 and the Heritage Supplementary Planning Document.",
    "The proposed development would give rise to development encroaching to the open rear of the site which by reason of its bulk, scale, roof design and position close to the boundaries of the site, appear unduly dominant, visually intrusive and overbearing in the rear garden environment harmful to the amenity of neighbouring properties and their rear gardens including loss of light and outlook particularly those to the east and west of the site. Further, the proposed terraces result in undue loss of privacy, harmful to residential amenity. In these respects, the proposal would be contrary to Policy 7 of the Local Plan 2021.",
    "In absence of details regarding the archaeological impact of the proposals on the archaeological interest surrounding the site, it would not be possible to adequately assess the effect of the proposals on the archaeological interest and their implications on the Gidea Hall and the Fish Pond, therefore the proposals would be contrary to the NPPF 2021 and Policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021.",

This charge has been levied under s.206 of the Planning Act 2008 and includes both the Mayor of London's CIL and Havering Council's CIL.",
    "London Borough of Havering, as CIL collecting authority, has responsibility for the collection of the Mayoral CIL, in addition to Havering's CIL, on commencement of the development.",
