  "decision_conditions": [
    "The development to which this permission relates must be commenced not later than three years from the date of this permission.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To comply with the requirements of Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended by Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004).",
    "The development hereby permitted shall not be carried out otherwise than in complete accordance with the approved plans (as set out on page one of this decision notice).",
    "Reason:-",
    "For the avoidance of doubt and to ensure that the development is carried out as approved.",
    "Notwithstanding the provisions of the Town and Country Planning (Use Classes) Order 1987 as amended, the use of the building hereby permitted shall not be for any other purpose than the stabling of horses. Furthermore there shall not be provision made for any other form of hard-surfacing within the curtilage of the site aside from the grasscrete access shown on drawing no. 17.4931/P201 Rev B. Should the use of the building for the stabling of horses permanently cease, unless planning permission is granted within 3 years of cessation of the use of the building for an alternate use, then the building and associated development shall be removed from the land, and the land must, so far as is practicable, be restored to its condition before the development took place, or to such condition as may have been agreed in writing between the Local Planning Authority and the developer.",
    "Reason: To ensure that the proposed use is appropriate in the Metropolitan Green Belt in accordance with Policy D",
    "Statement Required by Article 35(2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management) Order 2015: No significant problems were identified during the consideration of the application, and therefore it has been determined in accordance with paragraph 38 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2018."
