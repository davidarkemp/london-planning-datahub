  "description": "Proposed two storey side extension to provide additional floor space to the existing shop and conversion of the existing 1 x 2 bedroom first floor flat into 1 x 1 bedroom and 1 x 2 bedroom self contained flats",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed two storey side extension would, by reason of its height, bulk, mass and proximity to the side boundary, appear as an unacceptably dominant and visually intrusive feature in the streetscene harmful to the character and appearance of the host property and visual amenity of the surrounding area contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD.",
    "The proposed development would, by reason of the inadequate provision of amenity space, result in a cramped over-development of the site to the detriment of the amenity of future occupiers. The proposed shared amenity space offers insufficient dimensions to accommodate the intended residential occupancy of the flats. The quality and usability of the amenity space is poor in that it lacks direct access from the flats or from within the site. The quality of the living conditions would be substandard in direct contrast to the aims of London Plan Policy 3.5, the Residential Design SPD and Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD.",
    "The proposal, if granted planning permission on appeal, would be liable for the Mayor of London and Havering Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). Based upon the information supplied with the application, the CIL payable would be £950 and £4,750, respectively. Further details with regard to CIL are available from the Council's website.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to the agent in writing on 10/9/20."
