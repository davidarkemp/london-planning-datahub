    "The proposed pv panels would, by reason of their positioning and overly prominent impact above the ridge line of the main roof introduce an element into the street scene which is inconsistent with the existing pattern of development along Heath Park Road harmful to the character of both the host dwelling and the street scene contrary to Policies 7 and 26 of the Local Plan.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: In accordance with paragraph 38 of the National Planning Policy Framework, improvements required to make the proposal acceptable were negotiated with the agent via email on 15/09/2023.  The revisions involved moving the pv panels further away from the ridge line to reduce their prominence.  The applicant declined to make the suggested revisions."
