    "The proposed roof height increase, upper floor rear extension and additional height to the roof of the existing rear extension would, by reason of its height, scale, bulk and proximity to the neighbouring property no.133 Church Road as well as the proposed use of the roof of the existing single storey rear extension as a balcony amenity area, be an intrusive, overbearing and unneighbourly development that would have a significant adverse effect on the amenities of these adjacent occupiers contrary to Policy 7 of the Havering Local Plan and the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document.",
    "The proposal would, by reason of its bulk, height and mass close to the boundaries of the site, appear as an unacceptably dominant and visually intrusive feature in the streetscene harmful to the appearance of the surrounding area contrary to Policy 7 and 26 of the Havering Local Plan and the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document.",
    "The arrangement of bedroom areas in relation to the adjacent living areas combined with poor quality outlook from habitable room windows, lack of dual aspect dwellings, positioning of habitable room windows directly in front of parking spaces / bin stores and lack of acceptable outdoor amenity space would give rise to a poor quality living environment for future occupiers of the flats, contrary to Policy 7 and 9 of the Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 and Policy D6 of the London Plan.",
    "The proposal has an overprovision of car parking and does not adequately demonstrate that adequate provision can be made for the safe, secure storage of cycles or for refuse awaiting collection.  By reason of the cramped arrangement of the site, it is not clear how the scheme is able to demonstrate that the cycle and refuse storage can adequately be provided for within the site, contrary to Policy 7 of the Havering Local Plan 2016-2031.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, it was necessary to issue a decision as close to the statutory timeframe as possible as opposed to seeking amendments which would have significantly delayed the application."
