    "The proposed extensions would, by reason of its excessive depth, height and position close to the boundaries of the site, have an unacceptable impact on the neighbouring amenity and would be unacceptable when assessed against policy DC61 of the Havering Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD 2008, as well as policies 7.4, 7.5 and 7.6 of the London Plan 2016 (MALP), the Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD, and the Residential Design SPD.",
