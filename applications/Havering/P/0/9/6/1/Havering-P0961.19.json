    "The proposed equipment would be harmful to the character and appearance of the area due to the dominant and intrusive presence of the equipment sought, due to a combination of the increased height and physical presence of the replacement pole and proliferation of equipment at street-level. The proposals would be contrary to policies DC61 and DC64 of the DCDPD which requires proposals to have regard to the quality of the urban environment and for telecommunications equipment specifically to respect the character and appearance of the surrounding area and would harm the visual amenity of the surrounding environment.",
