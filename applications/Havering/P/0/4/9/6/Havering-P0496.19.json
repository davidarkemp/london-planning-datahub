    "The development hereby permitted shall not be carried out otherwise than in complete accordance with the approved plans (as set out on page one of this decision notice).",
    "Reason:-",
    "The Local Planning Authority consider it essential that the whole of the development is carried out and that no departure whatsoever is made from the details approved, since the development would not necessarily be acceptable if partly carried out or carried out differently in any degree from the details submitted.  Also, in order that the development accords with Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policy DC61.",
    "The use of the annexe hereby permitted shall be used only as living accommodation as an integral part of the existing dwelling to the rear of no.5 Heath Drive, as approved under application P1546.09, and shall not be subdivided from the plot or used as a separate unit of residential accommodation at any time.",

    "Notwithstanding the provisions of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 no extensions, outbuildings, walls, fences or other means of enclosure shall be erected unless permission under the provisions of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 has first been sought and obtained in writing from the Local Planning Authority",
    "Reason: In order that the annexe approved remains ancillary to the main dwelling, in the interests of amenity, to enable the Local Planning Authority to retain control over future development, and in order that the development accords with Policy DC61 of the Development Control Policies Development Plan Document.",
    "Notwithstanding the provisions of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 2015 (as amended), no window or other opening (other than those shown on the submitted and approved plan,) shall be formed in the flank or rear wall(s) of the building(s) hereby permitted, unless specific permission under the provisions of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 has first been sought and obtained in writing from the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:-",
    "In order to ensure a satisfactory development that will not result in any loss of privacy or damage to the environment of neighbouring properties which exist or may be proposed in the future, and in order that the development accords with  Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policy DC61.",
    "The area set aside for car-parking as shown on drawing no. H0A03/A to serve no. 5 Heath Drive shall be made available for vehicle parking and retained permanently thereafter for the accommodation of vehicles attending/visiting that premises",
    "Reason:-",
    "To ensure that car parking accommodation is made permanently available to the standards adopted by the Local Planning Authority in the interest of highway safety, and that the development accords with the Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policy DC33.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: In accordance with paragraph 38 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2018, improvements required to make the proposal acceptable were negotiated with the applicant in writing. The revisions involved the provision of a parking space to serve no.5 following cessation of the relationship of the garage to that premises.The amendments were subsequently submitted on 24-06-2019",
    "House indicated as \"new\" on submitted drawings is development that was approved under application P1546.09. Implementation of this consent commenced some years ago however the property remains under construction at the time of site inspection and is not presentably habitable. For the avoidance of doubt the arrangements hereby approved would supersede those of approved plans."
