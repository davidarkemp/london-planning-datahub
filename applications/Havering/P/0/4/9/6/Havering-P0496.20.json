  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed (side/rear) extension combined with the scale of the alterations to the roof by reason of its excessive depth, height and scale would significantly harm the architectural composition of the building by over-dominating the host building and unbalancing the symmetrical aspect of the pair of semi-detached houses  in a prominent position and therefore it  would unacceptably be an intrusive and unneighbourly development and unbalance the appearance of this pair of semi-detached property thereby having an adverse effect on the visual amenities and character of the area, contrary to Policy DC61 of the London Borough of Havering LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD 2008 and the London Borough of Havering Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD 2011.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to Mr Aqib Ahmed via email on the 04/06/20.",
    "It would appear that there are some inaccuracy in the proposed drawings illustrating of the existing rear dormer in relation to the host dwelling as seen from the officer site visit photos."
