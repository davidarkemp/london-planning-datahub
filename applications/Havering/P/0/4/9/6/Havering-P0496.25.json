    "The proposed rear dormer and hip to gable extensions by reason of its height, bulk and mass would not appear suitably subservient to the scale of the existing dwelling and would appear as a dominant and bulky feature in the immediate area, contrary to Policies 7 and 26 of the Havering Local Plan and the Council's Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document.",
    "The proposed roof extensions would, by reason of its positioning, scale, bulk and proximity to the nearby properties at no.10 and no.14 Ardleigh Close, be an intrusive, overbearing and unneighbourly development that would have a significant adverse effect on the amenities of these adjacent occupiers resulting in an increased sense of enclosure with an overbearing impact to habitable windows contrary to Policy 7 of the Havering Local Plan and the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, it was necessary to issue a decision as close to the statutory timeframe as possible as opposed to seeking amendments which would have significantly delayed the application."
