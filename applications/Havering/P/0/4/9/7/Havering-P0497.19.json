    "The proposed development would, by reason of its scale, bulk and mass, appear as an incongruous and unacceptably dominant and visually intrusive feature in the street scene. The development would harm the spacious character of the area and would be at odds with the surrounding pattern of development and would therefore be harmful to the character and appearance of the surrounding area contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD and Policy 7.4 of the London Plan.",
    "The proposed development would not demonstrate a suitably high quality living environment for future occupiers, with the arrangement shown symptomatic of a cramped overdevelopment of the site which would be the detriment of the amenity of future occupiers. The development would also demonstrate an inadequate provision of usable amenity space and as such the development would give rise to a poor quality living environment contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD, the Residential Design SPD and Policy 3.5 of the London Plan.",
    "The proposed development would, by way of its scale, bulk and mass and limited separation from  shared boundaries represent a dominant and oppressive feature which would restrict the outlook of adjacent residential units and appear as an overbearing feature to the detriment of the amenity of those occupiers and giving rise to unacceptable loss of light and levels of overshadowing thereby contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to the agent in writing 19-08-2019.",

This charge has been levied under s.206 of the Planning Act 2008 and includes both the Mayor of London's CIL and Havering Council's CIL.",
    "London Borough of Havering, as CIL collecting authority, has responsibility for the collection of the Mayoral CIL, in addition to Havering's CIL, on commencement of the development. Based upon calculations undertaken by the case officer and information supplied with the application your proposal is subject to a CIL Liability Notice indicating a levy of £5625 plus indexation for the application, based on the Mayoral CIL levy rate for Havering of £25/sq.m plus Havering's charging rate for residential of £125/sq.m (Zone A) and the floorspace of 22"
