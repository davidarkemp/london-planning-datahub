    "The proposed change of use would, by reason of its location and relationship to nearby sensitive receptors, in particular residential properties above and to the rear of the premises in Gibson Court, result in an unsatisfactory relationship by way of noise and disturbance which would be to the detriment of the amenity and living conditions of neighbouring occupiers. The proposed development is therefore contrary to Policies DC55 and DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD.",
