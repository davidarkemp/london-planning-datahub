    "The proposed first floor rear extension would, by reason of its design, bulk and positioning close to the common boundary appear as an overly dominate and inappropriate form of development. The extension would be intrusive from the perspective of both adjacent neighbours and would reduce their outlook particularity to No. 23 Nelson Road. The extension is judged to be materially harmful to the character of the local area and the amenity of both attached neighbours contrary to Policies 7 & 26 of the Havering Local Plan and the Council's Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD (2011).",
