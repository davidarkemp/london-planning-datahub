    "The hip to gable roof alteration and large rear dormer window to be retained, by reason of its gabled roof form over the two storey side extension and the combined scale, bulk and mass on the roof alteration, including the rear dormer window, unbalances the appearance of the semi-detached pair and is unduly prominent and detracts from the character and appearance of the street scene and rear garden environment contrary to Policy 26 of the Local Plan 2021, the Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD (2011), Policy D4 of the London Plan and also the guidance within the NPPF.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to Mr Eric Garcia by e-mail on 21/05/25."
