  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed development would by way of inappropriate design result in overdevelopment of the site, and is unacceptable. Furthermore, the proposed development would by reason of the size and scale of the development, have an unacceptable impact on the neighbouring amenity including impacts of daylight, sense of enclosure and outlook, and is unacceptable when assessed against policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD 2008. Consequently in the unambiguous wording of policy DC61, the application must be refused.",
    "The proposed development would fail to ensure that there is sufficient on-site parking for the existing properties on the site, and would have unacceptable impacts on parking provision and parking stress in the local area, and is contrary to policy 6.13 and table 6.2 of London Plan 2016 (MALP), policy T6.5 of the Draft London Plan (intend to publish December 2009), and policies DC32 and DC33 of LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD 2008.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to the agent prior to the decision notice being issued."
