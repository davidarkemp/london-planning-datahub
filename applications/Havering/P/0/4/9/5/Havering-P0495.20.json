  "decision_conditions": [
    "The site is within the area identified in the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document as Metropolitan Green Belt.  The LDF and Government Guidance as set out in the NPPF is that in order to achieve the purposes of the Metropolitan Green Belt it is essential to retain and protect the existing rural character of the area so allocated and that the new development will only be permitted outside the existing built up areas in the most exceptional circumstances.  The proposed extensions in accumulation to previous extensions to the property would result in disproportionate additions to the property over and above its original form, which is detrimental to the open character of the Green Belt.  No very special circumstances have been submitted to justify this and the proposal is therefore contrary to Policy DC45 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document and the provisions of the NPPF.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to the agent in writing 23/06/20"
