    "The proposed conversion of an existing dwelling into self contained flats has a poor standard of internal layout that would likely lead to unacceptable noise and general disturbance to the attached neighbouring property at 11 Fernden Way through noise transmission. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies DC61 of the London Borough of Havering's LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD, DCLG Technical Housing Standards March 2015, the Housing Standards Minor Alterations to the London Plan, Policy 3.5 of the London Plan and the Housing SPG 2016.",
    "The proposed development would, by reason of the inadequate provision of amenity space for both flats be contrary to DC61 of the London Borough of Havering's LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD 2008, and the Residential Design Supplementary Planning Document.",
    "The proposed conversion of the existing dwelling into two self-contained flats, by reason of the insufficient provision of car parking would give rise to significant parking congestion in the locality to the detriment of residential amenity and highway safety and contrary to Policies DC33 and DC35 of the London Borough of Havering's LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD 2008.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to Paul Seager via email on 18th June 2019."
