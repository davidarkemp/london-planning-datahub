    "The proposed development would, given its scale, siting and nature, appear dominant, visually intrusive and out of character in the rear garden environment and give rise to an intensification of use and result in unacceptable levels of noise and disturbance and an increase in pedestrian and vehicular movements, particularly during early morning and early evening, detrimental to neighbouring amenity contrary to Policies DC26 and DC61 of the Local Development Framework Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document.",
    "There is an absence of drop off and collection points for parents/carers and insufficient car parking provision for staff of the proposed nursery, which would result in unacceptable overspill onto the adjoining roads to the detriment of highway safety and residential amenity, thereby increasing congestion in the area and combined with parking restrictions and the proximity of the site to the junction of Brookdale Avenue, would be harmful to highway and pedestrian safety contrary to Policies DC32 and DC33 of the Local Development Framework Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to Munday + Cramer via email on 7th June 2021.",
