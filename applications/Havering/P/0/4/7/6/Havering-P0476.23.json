    "The proposed two storey side/rear extension would, by reason of its excessive width, scale, bulk and mass at first-floor level, appear as a dominant and visually intrusive feature in the street and rear garden scenes that would be harmful to the appearance of the surrounding area, contrary to the Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD and Policies 7 and 26 of the Havering Local Plan.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Improvements to the proposal to reduce the width of the first-floor side/rear element of the proposal were negotiated with the agent during the course of the application. However, the bulk, scale and mass of the proposal was considered at detailed assessment stage to still be unacceptable. Further significant alteration would have been required to bring the development within the realms of acceptability so it was decided to proceed to determine the application."
