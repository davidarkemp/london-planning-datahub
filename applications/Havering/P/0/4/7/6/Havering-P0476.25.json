    "The development in the form of the front boundary wall, gates and railings, would by reason of its design, height and position form an unacceptably dominant and visually intrusive feature, harmful to the appearance of the street scene and detracting from the open character of the surrounding area, contrary to Section 10 of the London Borough of Havering Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document 2011 and Policy 7 and 26 of London Borough of Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 Adopted 2021.",
