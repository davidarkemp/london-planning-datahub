    "The garage conversion, by reason of loss of parking and thus inadequate onsite car parking provision, results in unacceptable overspill onto the adjoining roads to the detriment of highway safety and residential amenity and contrary to Policies DC33 and DC61 of the Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document.",
    "The proposed rear extension would, by reason of its excessive depth be a visually intrusive feature in the rear garden environment and be harmful to the appearance of the surrounding area, contrary to Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD and Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, it was necessary to issue a decision as close to the statutory timeframe as possible as opposed to seeking amendments which would have significantly delayed the application."
