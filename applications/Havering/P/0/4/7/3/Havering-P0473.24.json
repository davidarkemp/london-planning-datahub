    "In the absence of a satisfactory justification, the proposals would result in the loss of Use Class B8 floor space on a non-designated industrial site, which would harm the long-term economic prospects of the Borough. The proposals are therefore contrary to policy 20 of the Local Plan and London Plan policy E7.",
    "The proposed development would, by reason of its bulk, design, appearance and siting, fail to integrate acceptably with the adjoining dwelling and would appear as an anomaly within the wider street scene, a cramped form of development which would adversely impact on visual amenity in the street scene contrary to Policy 26 of the Local Plan 2021, London Plan Policy D4 and the NPPF 2023.",
    "The proposed development would, by reason of its design and layout especially at the ground floor level, result in very deep habitable rooms with limited level of  light, privacy, noise and outlook, providing a constrained and sub-standard residential accommodation for future occupiers which would adversely impact on their living conditions, contrary to Policy 7 of the Local Plan, Policy D6 of the London Plan, the Housing Design Guide 2023 and the NPPF 2023.",
    "The unsatisfactory access to the proposed parking arrangement would adversely impact on the living condition of prospective occupiers of the proposed development at Flat 1 and, result in an unacceptable overspill onto the adjoining roads to the detriment of highway safety and residential amenity, contrary to Policy 24 of the Havering Local Plan and Policies T6 and T6.1 of the London Plan and the National Planning Policy Framework 2023.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to the agent in writing 23-05-2024.",
    "In the event that this application is allowed through the appeals process the proposals would be liable for the following CIL contributions:",
    "The proposals would incur a Mayoral CIL contribution of £4,475 at a rate of £25 per sqm (179m² x 25).",
    "The proposal is also liable for the Havering Community Infrastructure Levy (HCIL), which has a charging rate of £125 per square metre of net additional floor space in Zone A. The Havering Community Infrastructure Levy contribution would equate to £22,375.",
