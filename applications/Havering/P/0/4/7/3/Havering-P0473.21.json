    "The proposed development would, by reason of its height, bulk. mass, design and prominent siting within the street, forward of the building line of nearby properties,  appear as an unacceptably dominant and visually intrusive feature in the streetscene harmful to the appearance of the surrounding area contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: In accordance with paragraph 38 of the National Planning Policy Framework, improvements required to make the proposal acceptable were negotiated with the Agent by email on 04 August 2021. The revisions involved the correction of the site/location plan and changing the location of the front door from the flank wall of the porch to facing the street. The agent failed to respond and because the application is already significantly delayed, it was necessary to issue a decision as close to the statutory timeframe as possible."
