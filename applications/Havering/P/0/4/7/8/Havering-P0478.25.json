  "decision_conditions": [
    "The site is within the area identified in the Local Plan as Metropolitan Green Belt. The Local Plan, as well as the London Plan and the guidance given in the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) emphasise that in order to achieve the purposes of the Metropolitan Green Belt it is essential to retain and protect the openness of the green belt and that the new development will only be permitted outside the existing built up areas in the most exceptional circumstances. The proposed extension, by reason of its depth, bulk and scale, would result in a disproportionate addition to the outbuilding that would consequently take its footprint over and above that of the original pre-existing barn within the site, something which would cause material harm to the character and openness of the Metropolitan Green Belt. The very special circumstances which have been submitted in this case are not considered to outweigh the substantial harm of the inappropriate development. The proposal is therefor",
