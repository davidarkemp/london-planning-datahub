    "Reason: To ensure that the appearance of the proposed development will harmonise with the character of the surrounding area.",
    "The development hereby permitted shall not be carried out otherwise than in complete accordance with the approved plans (as set out on page one of this decision notice).",
    "Reason:-",
    "For the avoidance of doubt and to ensure that the development is carried out as approved.",
    "Before the dwelling hereby permitted is first occupied, the car parking provision as shown on drawing 1983/03 shall be laid out and surfaced to the satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority and retained permanently thereafter and shall not be used for any other purpose.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To ensure that car parking accommodation is made permanently available to the standards adopted by the Local Planning Authority in the interest of highway safety.",
    "Notwithstanding the provisions of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (Order) or any other order replacing or amending the said Order other than porches erected in accordance with the Order, no extension or enlargement (including additions to roofs) shall be made to the dwellinghouse(s) hereby permitted, or any detached building erected, without the express permission in writing of the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:-",
    "In the interests of amenity and to enable the Local Planning Authority to retain control over future development.",
    "Notwithstanding the provisions of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015, no window or other opening (other than those shown on the submitted and approved plan) shall be formed in the flank wall(s) of the building(s) hereby permitted, unless specific permission under the provisions of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 has first been sought and obtained in writing from the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:-",
    "In order to ensure a satisfactory development that will not result in any loss of privacy or damage to the environment of neighbouring properties which exist or may be proposed in the future.",
    "All building operations in connection with the construction of external walls, roof, and foundations; site excavation or other external site works; works involving the use of plant or machinery; the erection of scaffolding; the delivery of materials; the removal of materials and spoil from the site, and the playing of amplified music shall only take place between the hours of 8.00am and 6.00pm Monday to Friday, and between 8.00am and 1.00pm on Saturdays and not at all on Sundays and Bank Holidays/Public Holidays.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To protect residential amenity.",
    "All dwellings hereby approved shall be constructed to comply with Part M4(2) of the Building Regulations - Accessible and Adaptable Dwellings.",

    "In order to ensure no water run-off from the hard surface which would contribute to risk of flooding.",
    "The development hereby approved shall be fitted with Ultra-Low NOx boilers with maximum NOx Emissions less than 40 mg/kWh. Where any installations do not meet this emissions standard it should not be operated without the fitting of suitable NOx abatement equipment or technology as determined by a specialist to ensure comparable emissions. The installation of the boilers shall be carried out in strict accordance with these details and shall thereafter be permanently retained.",
    "Reason: To minimise the impact of building emissions on local air quality.",
    "All residential parking spaces within the development hereby approved shall include provision of infrastructure for electric or Ultra-Low Emission vehicles, of which a minimum of 1 space shall have active charging facilities, with passive provision for all remaining spaces. Such provision is to be made prior to the first occupation of the dwelling hereby permitted.",
    "Reason:  Provision prior to first occupation of the proposed dwellings hereby permitted will ensure that the development adequately incorporates measures to allow the use of electric vehicles by future occupiers in accordance with Policy T6.1 of the London Plan.",
    "No works shall take place in relation to any of the development hereby approved until a Construction Method Statement to control the adverse impact of the development on the amenity of the public and nearby occupiers is submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority.

    "The hard landscaping shall be carried out prior to occupation in accordance with the approved plans.  The soft landscaping and all planting, seeding or turfing comprised within the scheme shall be carried out in the first planting season following completion of the development and any trees or plants which within a period of 5 years from completion of the development die, are removed or become seriously damaged or diseased shall be replaced in the next planting season with others of a similar size and species, unless otherwise agreed in writing by the local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To ensure that the development achieves a satisfactory level of landscape quality.",
    "Before the dwelling hereby permitted is first occupied, the bin storage shall be provided in accordance with details shown on drawing no. 1983/03 hereby approved and retained permanently thereafter.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To ensure adequate refuse and recycling storage on the site.",
    "Before the dwelling hereby permitted is first occupied, the cycle storage shall be provided in accordance with details shown on drawing no. 1983/03 hereby approved and retained permanently thereafter.",

Highway Authority approval will only be given after suitable details have been submitted considered and agreed. If new or amended access is required (whether temporary or permanent), there may be a requirement for the diversion or protection of third party utility plant or highway authority assets and it is recommended that early involvement with the relevant statutory undertaker takes place.
