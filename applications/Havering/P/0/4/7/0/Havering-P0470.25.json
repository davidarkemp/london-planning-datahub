    "The plans are inaccurate and do not reflect what has been built on site, which comprises of a build up of side walls to roof level incorporating rear roof extension, roof lights and a porch (not considered to be permitted development). As such, the proposed plans do not accurately reflect the proposed part single, part two storey side/rear extension when viewed against the extended dwelling and full consideration of the proposals is not possible.",
    "Notwithstanding Reason 1, the proposed first floor rear extension would, by reason of its excessive depth, scale, bulk, mass, and proximity to the north eastern boundary with No. 303 Brentwood Road, be an unneighbourly development and appear dominant and visually intrusive in the rear garden environment harmful to the amenity to neighbouring properties contrary to Policy 7 of the Havering Local Plan, the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document and the National Planning Policy Framework.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to Tech Engineering (UK) Ltd via email on 18th July 2025."
