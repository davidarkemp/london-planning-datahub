  "decision_conditions": [
    "The development to which this permission relates must be commenced not later than three years from the date of this permission.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To comply with the requirements of Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended by Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004).",
    "The development hereby permitted shall not be carried out otherwise than in complete accordance with the approved plans (as set out on page one of this decision notice).",
    "Reason:-",
    "The Local Planning Authority consider it essential that the whole of the development is carried out and that no departure whatsoever is made from the details approved, since the development would not necessarily be acceptable if partly carried out or carried out differently in any degree from the details submitted.  Also, in order that the development accords with Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policy DC61.",
    "Before the use hereby permitted commences details of a scheme shall be submitted to and approved in writing by  the local planning authority which specifies the provisions to be made for the control of noise emanating from the site. Such scheme as may be approved shall be implemented prior to first occupation and thereafter retained in accordance with such details.",
    "To minimise the impact of the development on the surrounding area in the interests of amenity, and that the development accords with the Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policy DC61.",
    "Before any relevant works commence, a scheme for any new plant or machinery including the condenser installation details shall be submitted to the local planning authority to achieve the following standard. Noise levels expressed as the equivalent continuous sound level LAeq (1 hour) when calculated at the boundary with the nearest noise sensitive premises shall not exceed LA90 -10dB and shall be maintained thereafter to the satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority.",
    "To ensure that the amenity of occupies of the development site/surrounding premises is not adversely affected by noise from mechanical installations/ equipment, and that the development accords with the Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policies DC55 and DC61.",
    "The use hereby approved shall only be used between hours of:",
    "10:00 -  17:00 Mondays - Fridays",
    "10:00 - 16:00 Saturdays",
    "Not at all on Sundays and Bank Holidays.",
    "To minimise the impact of the development on the surrounding area in the interests of amenity, and that the development accords with the Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policy DC61.",
    "Before the use hereby permitted commences, details of a waste management scheme must be submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority. The scheme shall include details of the method and location of refuse and recycling storage, including provision for all refuse to be properly contained within the approved facility, together with arrangements for refuse disposal. The scheme shall be permanently retained thereafter.",
    "Reason:-",
    "Insufficient information has been supplied with the application to judge how waste will be managed on site.  Submission of this details will protect the amenity of occupiers of nearby premises, and ensure that the development accords with the Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policy DC61.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: No significant problems were identified during the consideration of the application, and therefore it has been determined in accordance with paragraph 38 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2019."
