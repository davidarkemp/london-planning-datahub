    "This permission shall be for a limited period only expiring on 2nd July 2024 on or before which date the use hereby permitted shall be discontinued, the buildings and works carried out under this permission shall be removed and the site reinstated to its former condition to the satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:",
    "Arcade place also serves as a service road for access to commercial buildings plus access to parking spaces to the existing commercial building. The servicing arrangement to the commercial building may likely to be altered as a result of new development in the access road and hence a permanent permission would not be acceptable. The Local Planning Authority would wish to retain control to consider future servicing arrangement of the likely development in the vicinity of the site.",
    "The development hereby permitted shall not be carried out otherwise than in complete accordance with the approved plans, particulars and specifications.",
    "Reason:- The Local Planning Authority consider it essential that the whole of the development is carried out and that no departure whatsoever is made from the details approved, since the development would not necessarily be acceptable if partly carried out or carried out differently in any degree from the details submitted.  Also, in order that the development accords with the provisions of Policy DC61 of the London Borough of Havering's LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policy 2008.",
    "The external seating area hereby approved shall take place only within the area as shown on Drawing 02 Revision B.",
    "Reason: In order to contain potential obstruction of the pavements in the interests of pedestrian safety and in the interests of highway safety in accordance with the provisions of Policy DC61 of the London Borough of Havering's LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policy 2008.",
    "The seating area shall not be used for the purposes hereby permitted other than between the hours of 12pm till 11pm on Monday to Friday, 12pm till 12am on Saturdays and 12pm till 11pm on Sundays.  Outside of these times, the external tables and seating hereby approved shall be removed from the seating area and stored internally within the premises until the following day.",
    "Reason: To enable the Local Planning Authority to retain control in the interests of amenity, and in order that the development accords with Policy DC61 of the London Borough of Havering's LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policy 2008.",
    "No music or speech shall be played and no sound reproduction equipment shall be placed in the outside seating area.",
    "Reason:- To prevent noise nuisance to adjoining properties in accordance with Policy DC61 of the London Borough of Havering's LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policy 2008.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: In accordance with paragraph 38 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2018, improvements required to make the proposal acceptable were negotiated with Mr Orlando via the telephone and email on 1st July 2021. The revisions involved amending the description of the proposal from a permanent external seating area on an existing forecourt to temporary permission for an external seating area on an existing forecourt. The amendments were subsequently submitted on 2nd July 2021."
