    "The proposed development would by reason of its gable roof design to the front and flat roof design over the first floor side/rear extension represent a design solution which would unacceptable unbalance this pair of semi-detached properties. It would fail to maintain a gap to the boundary thereby creating a terracing effect and as such appear as an incongruous, visually dominant and intrusive feature in the streetscene and rear garden environment harmful to the character and appearance of the host dwelling and surrounding area. As such, the proposal is contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD,  the Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD 2011and Policy 7.4 of the London Plan 2016.",
