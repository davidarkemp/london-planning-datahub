    "The proposed development would, by reason of its proximity to the large and protected oak trees (T1, T2 & T3) would severely compromise the quality, safety and usability of the external amenity space which would limit the functionality of any garden space harmful to amenity of future occupiers of the proposed dwelling and contrary to Local Plan Policies 7 and 10.",
    "The proposed development would by reason of its siting and likely proposed works to trees as set out in drawing 08B and in the applicant's submitted Tree Survey Report result in future pressure for the removal of the oak trees protected by TPO 8/99. The consequent reduction in the public amenity value of the trees would be unduly harmful to the verdant character of this part of Hornchurch Road such that it would adversely affect the visual amenity of the streetscene contrary to Local Plan Policies 26 and 27 and Policy G7 of the 2021 London Plan.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reasons for it was given to the agent on 20th December 2023.",
