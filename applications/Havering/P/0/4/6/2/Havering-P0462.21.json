  "description": "Demolition of existing Assembly Rooms and construction of 2 No. maisonette style dwellings",
  "application_type": "All Other",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed replacement building would through its overall height, bulk and mass, development footprint and design approach including materials and concept appear as unacceptably dominant and visually intrusive feature harmful to the appearance of the surrounding area inconsistent with surrounding local character contrary to Policy D4 of the London Plan (2016), Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD. There would also be conflict with paragraph 127 of the National Planning Policy Framework (the Framework) which states that developments should function well, add to the overall quality of the area and be sympathetic to local character and the design principles set out within the Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD.",
    "The proposed development would fail to demonstrate an acceptable living environment for future occupants, through a deficit in internal space and the lack of permeability and legibility of the development for future occupants of the upper level accommodation through reliance on land outside of the red-line plan boundary and low quality amenity area, which is conducive to a cramped overdevelopment of the site which would be detrimental to the amenity of future occupiers. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD, the Residential Design SPD and Policy D6 of the London Plan 2021. There would also be conflict with paragraph 127 of the National Planning Policy Framework which seeks to ensure a high standard of amenity for future users of development.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to the agent in writing 11-05-2021.",
    "The proposals if granted planning permission on appeal would incur a Mayoral CIL contribution of £2,625 at a rate of £25 per sqm (105m² x 25).",
    "Additionally the proposals would also liable for the Havering Community Infrastructure Levy (HCIL), which has a charging rate of £125 per square metre of net additional floor space in Zone A. The Havering Community Infrastructure Levy contribution would equate to £13,125",
    "Each contribution would be subject to indexation."
