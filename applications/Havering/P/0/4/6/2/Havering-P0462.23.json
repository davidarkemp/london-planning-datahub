    "The proposed dwelling has a gross internal floor space of 75m² which fails to meet the minimum gross internal floor area of 90 square metres contained in Policy D6 of the London Plan and would be harmful to the amenity and living conditions of future occupiers contrary to Policy 7 of the Havering Local Plan and Policy D6 of the London Plan.",
    "The proposed development would, by reason of its gabled roof, bulk, mass and siting on a prominent corner, fail to integrate acceptably with the host dwelling and appear incongruous in the street scene. The development would therefore be visually intrusive, and out of scale and character with the pattern of development in the surrounding environment and be harmful to the appearance of the site and surrounding area contrary to Polices 7 and 26 of the Havering Local Plan and the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35(2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management) Order 2015: No significant problems were identified during the consideration of the application, and therefore it has been determined in accordance with paragraph 38 of the National Planning Policy Framework.",
    "The proposal, if granted planning permission on appeal, would be liable for the Mayor of London and Havering Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). Based upon the information supplied with the application, the Mayoral CIL payable would be £3,050 based on the calculation of £25.00 per square metre and the Havering Community Infrastructure Levy (HCIL) would be a charge of £15,250 based on calculation of £125 per square metre. Each would be subject to indexation.",
