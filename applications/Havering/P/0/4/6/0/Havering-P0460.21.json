    "The proposed two storey rear extension would by virtue of the bulk, mass and scale would be incongruous, dominant and visually intrusive in the rear garden environment and appear a prominent feature when viewed from Charlbury Crescent contrary to policies D1 and D4 of The London Plan (2021), policy DC61 of the London Borough of Havering LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD 2008, and the London Borough of Havering Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD 2011.",
    "The proposed two storey extension would, by reason of its excessive scale, height and the proximity to the northern shared boundary, be unneighbourly which would give rise to an uncomfortable and overbearing effect resulting in an increased sense of enclosure and outlook, and be materially harmful to the amenity of the northern neighbouring property, no. 160a Charlbury Crescent, contrary to Policy DC61 of the London Borough of Havering LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD 2008, and the London Borough of Havering Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD 2011.",
