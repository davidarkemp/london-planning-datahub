    "The development to which this permission relates must be commenced not later than three years from the date of this permission.",

    "The development hereby permitted shall not be carried out otherwise than in complete accordance with the approved plans (as set out on page one of this decision notice).",
    "Reason:-",
    "For the avoidance of doubt and to ensure that the development is carried out as approved.",
    "The vehicular access to the front hereby permitted shall be surfaced with porous materials, or provision shall be made to direct run-off water from the hard surface to a permeable or porous area or surface within the curtilage of the dwellinghouse.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To ensure that surface water run-off is controlled, in order to reduce the impact of flooding and pollution of water courses, and that the development accords with the Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policies DC49 and DC61.",
    "The vehicle crossover/dropped kerb requires the Local Borough of Havering's Highway's Authority to carry out the design, construction and implementation of the works. The applicant must apply to the Highways Authority for a vehicle crossover/dropped kerb at the following link:",
    "https://www.havering.gov.uk/info/20004/parking/141/apply_for_a_dropped_kerb",
    "Reason:-",
    "Please note that unauthorised works to the highway is an offence. A vehicle crossover in the London Borough of Havering is only permitted to be constructed by the LBH Highways Authority and not by any other third party, unless authorised by the Council in writing.",
    "With regards to surface water drainage it is the responsibility of the developer to make proper provision for drainage to ground, water courses or a suitable sewer.  In respect of surface water it is recommended that the applicant should ensure that storm flows are attenuated or regulated into the receiving public network through on or off site storage.  When it is proposed to connect to a combined public sewer, the site drainage should be separate and combined at the final manhole nearest the boundary.  Connections are not permitted for the removal of Ground Water.  Where the developer proposes to discharge to a public sewer, prior approval from Thames Water Developer Services will be required.  They can be contacted on 0845 850 2777.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35(2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management) Order 2015: No significant problems were identified during the consideration of the application, and therefore it has been determined in accordance with paragraph 38 of the National Planning Policy Framework."
