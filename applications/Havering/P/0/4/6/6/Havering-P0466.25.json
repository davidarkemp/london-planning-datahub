  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed two storey side extension, roof remodelling and flat roof rear dormer would, by reason of its proportions, scale and design at this prominent location, appear as an incongruous development in relation to the existing host building, and visually intrusive feature in the street scene, and the surrounding area, especially from its junction with Winifred Avenue. As such, the proposal is contrary to Policies 7 & 26 of the Havering Local Plan 2021.",
    "The additional scale to the business use, based on the available details would adversely affect the nearby residential amenity in terms of noise and general disturbance and therefore would be contrary to Policies 7, 26 and 34 of the Havering Local Plan 2021, which seek amongst other things high quality development that ensures that the amenity and quality of  life of existing residents is not adversely affected. These aims are reflected in the National Planning Policy Framework at Para 130(f).",
    "Based on the proposed scale of the business use through additional intensity, would increase vehicle movement to and from the site over the existing use which would lead to increase demand for on-street parking and encourage users to wait in close proximity to the site potentially detrimental to highway and pedestrian safety. The proposals would likely increase parking pressure and congestion at peak times to the detriment of surrounding neighbouring amenity and the safe and free flow of traffic with potential impact upon highways safety for both pedestrian and vehicular traffic. There would be conflict with Havering Local Plan 2021 Policies 16, 17, 23 and 24 in addition to Paragraph 111 of the NPPF.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, it was necessary to issue a decision as close to the statutory timeframe as possible as opposed to seeking amendments which would have significantly delayed the application."
