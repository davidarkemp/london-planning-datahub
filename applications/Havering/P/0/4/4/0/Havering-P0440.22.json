    "The proposed two storey rear extension would, by reason of its excessive width, scale, bulk, and mass would unacceptably unbalance the appearance of this pair of semi-detached house and appear as a dominant and visually intrusive feature in the rear garden environment, harmful to the appearance of the surrounding area, contrary to Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document and Policies 7 and 26 of the Havering Local Plan.",
    "The proposed two storey rear extension would, by reason of its excessive height, depth and position close to the boundaries of the site, be an intrusive and unneighbourly development as well as having an adverse effect on the amenities of adjacent occupiers contrary to Policies 7 of the Havering Local Plan and the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document.",
    "Details for a Re-submission Informative",
    "The applicant should provide 1m set back from the front wall of the dwelling and the first floor side extension instead of the 60cm provided. The use of a sit on /hidden gutter detail would be preferable compared to the parapet detail being proposed.",
    "Finally, the first floor rear extension needs to be set in 2m from each side boundary at the rear of the dwelling, to comply with guidance and the width needs to be subordinate to the main dwelling house on any revised scheme.",
    "Asbestos Removal Informative",
    "It has been brought to the Council's Planning Department's attention that the existing garage to the side of the dwelling may constructed with asbestos. Care needs to be undertaken when dealing with asbestos and it is recommended that you do not attempt to repair or remove the asbestos yourself. Only trained specialists should remove asbestos.",
    "A link to the Council's website regarding information for an applicant and neighbouring residents in respect to asbestos is added for your review below -",
