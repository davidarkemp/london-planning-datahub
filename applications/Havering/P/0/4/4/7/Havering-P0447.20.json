    "The proposed outbuilding would, by reason of its excessive height, scale, bulk and mass, appear as an unacceptably dominant and visually intrusive feature in the rear garden environment, harmful to the character and appearance of the surrounding area contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document, the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document and Policy 7.4 of the London Plan.",
    "The proposed development would, by reason of its excessive height with raised decking and front and side elevation windows overlooking neighbouring properties, cause overlooking and loss of privacy which would have a serious and adverse effect on the living conditions of adjacent occupiers, contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD.",
    "Please note that there is a discrepancy between the plans and what has been built. The site photos show a deck with a balustrade and stairs, but the plans omit this. If another application should be made in the future, the discrepancy should be rectified.",
