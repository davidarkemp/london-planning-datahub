    "The proposed two storey side extension would, by reason of its scale, bulk and mass, prominent siting and position close to the boundaries of the site, appear incongruous, visually intrusive, unduly cramped and out of character with the prevailing pattern of development, detrimental to the visual amenity of the locality and the street scene and rear garden environment contrary to Policy 26 of the Havering Local Plan, Havering's Residential Extensions Alterations SPD, Policy D4 of the London Plan and the guidance contained in the National Planning Policy Framework.",
    "The lack of car parking provision for the enlarged flat would result of an overspill of vehicles onto surrounding streets, contrary to Policy 24 of the Havering Local Plan and T6.1 of the London Plan.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to Mr Baradiya by e-mail on 24-05-23.",
    "Please be advised that approval of this application from 1st September 2019 (either by London Borough of Havering, or subsequently by PINS if allowed on appeal following a refusal by London Borough of Havering) will attract a liability payment of £4,125 plus indexation in Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This charge has been levied under s.206 of the Planning Act 2008 and includes both the Mayor of London's CIL and Havering Council's CIL.",
    "London Borough of Havering, as CIL collecting authority, has responsibility for the collection of the Mayoral CIL, in addition to Havering's CIL, on commencement of the development.",
    "Your proposal is subject to a CIL Liability Notice indicating a levy of £4,125 plus indexation for the application, based on the Mayoral CIL levy rate for Havering of £25/sq.m plus Havering's charging rate for residential of £125/sq.m (Zone A), and the floorspace of 55 square metres.",
    "You are advised to visit the planning portal website where you can download the a",
    "NOTE: Should planning permission be granted on appeal or by subsequent application, the applicant should be aware that the lawful use of the flat is a C3 Dwelling and the premises should remain as a self contained flat. London Borough of Havering have an Article 4 Direction in place that means that use of the premises as an C4 HMO would require planning permission."
