    "The proposed development by reason of its scale, bulk and in particular with respect to the poor design of the rear block would be out of character with the prevailing pattern of development in the surrounding area. The proposed excessive bulk and height of the rear block, its atypical roof form and blank elevation would have a harmful impact upon the visual amenity of the area, contrary to Policy 7 and 26 of the Local Plan 2021, policy D6 of the London Plan 2021 and the policy advice given in National Planning Policy Framework 2021.",
    "The proposed development is of a poor quality of accommodation with particular reference to units 4 and 5 on the ground floor. The proposed pedestrian and vehicular access between buildings would mean people passing by very close to habitable room windows. There would be no defensible space between windows and this right of way. The proximity of any passers-by is likely to create a definite perception of being overlooked and a lack of reasonable privacy. This also adds to the concerns over the living environment for those residents affected. Poor quality outlook, poor quality light and the perception of being overlooked would combine to create a confined, gloomy and oppressive environment. As such, the development fails to provide a satisfactory living environment. In addition the habitable room to unit 5 would face the boundary wall .9m away, thereby suffering poor outlook. In addition there would be inter-overlooking between the habitable rooms of the proposed building and those of a",
    "The proposed development would, by reason of its position and proximity to neighbouring properties cause overlooking and loss of privacy which would have a serious and adverse effect on the living conditions of adjacent occupiers, with respect to Jane Court. The proposal would also result in loss of light to one habitable bedroom of Corbridge Mews and two habitable room in Jane Court. There would be also significant loss of sunlight to the gardens of Corbridge Mews, contrary to Policy 7 of the Local Plan 2021.",
    "In the absence of a legal agreement to secure car free development the proposal would fail to satisfactorily provide sufficient parking provision resulting in an increased parking stress in the surrounding area contrary to policy 24 of the Local Plan.",

    "The proposal, if granted planning permission on appeal, would be liable for the Mayor of London and Havering Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). Based upon the information supplied with the application,the total net residential floor space would be 428 sqm. This would yield £10,700 mayoral CIL and £53,500 of Havering CIL, subject to indexation.Further details with regard to CIL are available from the Council's website."
