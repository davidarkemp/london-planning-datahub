    "The development to which this permission relates must be commenced not later than three years from the date of this permission.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To comply with the requirements of Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended by Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004).",
    "The development hereby permitted shall not be carried out otherwise than in complete accordance with the approved plans (as set out on page one of this decision notice).",
    "Reason:-",
    "For the avoidance of doubt and to ensure that the development is carried out as approved.",
    "Before  the commencement of any above ground works, written specification of external walls and roof materials to be used in the construction of the building(s) shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority and thereafter the development shall be constructed with the approved materials.",
    "Reason:-",
    "Insufficient information has been supplied with the application to judge the appropriateness of the materials to be used.  Submission of a written specification prior to commencement will ensure that the appearance of the proposed development will harmonise with the character of the surrounding area and comply with Policy DC61 of the Development Control Policies Development Plan Document.",
    "Notwithstanding the provisions of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 upon the occupation of the new dwellinghouse, the outbuilding(s) hereby permitted shall be used only for purposes incidental to the enjoyment of the dwelling house and not for any trade or business nor as living accommodation.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To restrict the use to one compatible with a residential area, and in order that the development accords with Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policy DC61.",
    "Notwithstanding the provisions of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015, other than porches erected in accordance with the Order, no extension or enlargement (including additions to roofs) shall be made to the dwellinghouse(s) hereby permitted, or any detached building erected, without the express permission in writing of the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:-",
    "In the interests of amenity and to enable the Local Planning Authority to retain control over future development, and in order that the development accords with Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policy DC61.",
    "All building operations in connection with the construction of external walls, roof, and foundations; site excavation or other external site works; works involving the use of plant or machinery; the erection of scaffolding; the delivery of materials; the removal of materials and spoil from the site, and the playing of amplified music shall only take place between the hours of 8.00am and 6.00pm Monday to Friday, and between 8.00am and 1.00pm on Saturdays and not at all on Sundays and Bank Holidays/Public Holidays.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To protect residential amenity, and in order that the development accords with the Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policy DC61.",
    "No building shall be occupied until refuse and recycling facilities are provided in accordance with details which shall previously have been submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority. The refuse and recycling facilities shall be permanently retained thereafter.",
    "Reason:-",
    "Insufficient information has been supplied with the application to judge how refuse and recycling will be managed on site.  Submission of this detail prior to occupation in the case of new building works or prior to the use commencing in the case of changes of use will protect the amenity of occupiers of the development and also the locality generally and ensure that the development accords with the Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policy DC61.",
    "No building shall be occupied until cycle storage is provided in accordance with details previously submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority. The cycle storage shall be permanently retained thereafter.",
    "Reason:-",
    "Insufficient information has been supplied with the application to demonstrate what facilities will be available for cycle parking.  Submission of this detail prior to occupation in the case of new building works or prior to the use commencing in the case of changes of use is in the interests of providing a wide range of facilities for non-motor car residents and sustainability.",
    "No works shall take place in relation to any of the development hereby approved until a Construction Method Statement to control the adverse impact of the development on the amenity of the public and nearby occupiers is submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority.

    "d)  measures for minimising the impact of noise and ,if appropriate, vibration arising from construction activities;",
    "e)  predicted noise and, if appropriate, vibration levels for construction using methodologies and at points agreed with the Local Planning Authority;",
    "f)  scheme for monitoring noise and if appropriate, vibration levels using methodologies and at points agreed with the Local Planning Authorities;",
    "g)  siting and design of temporary buildings;",
    "h)  scheme for security fencing/hoardings, depicting a readily vis",
    "The proposed windows located on the northern and southern flank walls at first floor levels  shall be permanently glazed with obscure glass not less than 4 on the standard scale of obscurity and shall thereafter be maintained.",
    "Reason:-",
    "In the interests of privacy, and in order that the development accords with the Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policy DC61.",
    "Before relevant works first commenced, vehicle cleansing facilities to prevent mud being deposited onto the public highway during construction works shall be provided on site in accordance with details to be first submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority. The approved facilities shall be retained thereafter and used at relevant entrances to the site throughout the duration of construction works. If mud or other debris originating from the site is deposited in the public highway, all on-site operations shall cease until it has been removed.",
    "The submission will provide;",
    "a)  A plan showing where vehicles will be parked within the site to be inspected for mud and debris and cleaned if required. The plan should show where construction traffic will access and exit the site from the public highway.",
    "b)  A description of how the parking area will be surfaced, drained and cleaned to prevent mud, debris and muddy water being tracked onto the public highway;",
    "c)  A",
    "Notwithstanding the provisions of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015, no window or other opening (other than those shown on the submitted and approved plan,) shall be formed in the flank wall(s) of the building(s) hereby permitted, unless specific permission under the provisions of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 has first been sought and obtained in writing from the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:-",
    "In order to ensure a satisfactory development that will not result in any loss of privacy or damage to the environment of neighbouring properties which exist or may be proposed in the future, and in order that the development accords with Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policy DC61.",
    "Prior to the first occupation of the development hereby permitted, details shall be submitted to and agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority for the installation of Ultra-Low NOx boilers with maximum NOx Emissions less than 40 mg/KWh. Where any installations do not meet this emissions standard it should not be operated without the fitting of suitable NOx abatement equipment or technology as determined by a specialist to ensure comparable emissions.  The installation of the boilers shall be carried out in strict accordance with the agreed details and shall thereafter be permanently retained.  Following installation emissions certificates will need to be provided to the Local Planning Authority to verify boiler emissions.",
    "Reason: To minimise the impact of building emissions on local air quality.",
    "No building shall be occupied until the four car parking spaces shown on the approved plans nos. 1695/04 and 1695/5 has been provided and retained thereafter.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To ensure that car parking is made permanently available to the standards adopted by the Local Planning Authority in the interest of highway safety, and that the development accords with the Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policy DC33.",
    "No above ground works shall take place in relation to any of the development hereby approved until there has been submitted to and approved by the Local Planning Authority a scheme of hard and soft landscaping, which shall include indications of all existing trees and shrubs on the site, and details of any to be retained, together with measures for the protection in the course of development. All planting, seeding or turfing comprised within the scheme shall be carried out in the first planting season following completion of the development and any trees or plants which within a period of 5 years from completion of the development die, are removed or become seriously damaged or diseased shall be replaced in the next planting season with others of a similar size and species, unless otherwise agreed in writing by the local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:-",
    "Insufficient information has been supplied with the application to judge the appropriateness of the hard and soft landscaping proposed.",
    "Prior to the occupation of the development hereby approved, details of all proposed walls, fences and boundary treatment shall be submitted to, and approved in writing by, the Local Planning Authority.  The boundary development shall then be carried out in accordance with the approved details and retained permanently thereafter to the satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:-",
    "Insufficient information has been supplied with the application to judge the appropriateness of any boundary treatment.  Submission of this detail prior to commencement will protect the visual amenities of the development, prevent undue overlooking of adjoining property and ensure that the development accords with the Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policy DC61.",
    "Prior to commencement of the development here permitted details of the existing ground levels and the proposed ground and finished floor levels of the proposed development shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority.  The development shall then be carried out in accordance with the approved details.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To ensure that the development has an acceptable visual impact.",
    "Notwithstanding the privacy screen shown on the approved drawing no. 1695/03 Rev A, prior to the first occupation of no. 57 Hall Lane, a 1.8m privacy screen to the northern flank of the rear first floor balcony shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority.

    "All dwellings hereby approved shall comply with Regulation 36 (2)(b) and Part G2 of the Building Regulations - Water Efficiency.",
    "Reason:-",
    "In order to comply with Policy 5.15 of the London Plan.",
    "The building(s) shall be so constructed as to provide sound insulation of 43 DnT,w + Ctr dB (minimum values) against airborne noise and 64 L'nT,w dB (maximum values) against impact noise to the satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:  To minimise the impact of the development on the adjoining properties in the interests of amenity, and that the development accords with the Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policy DC61.",
    "a)\tIf, during development, contamination not previously identified is found to be present at the site then no further development (unless otherwise agreed in writing with the local planning authority) shall be carried out until a remediation strategy detailing how this unsuspected contamination shall be dealt with has been submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority. The remediation strategy shall be implemented as approved.",
    "b)\tFollowing completion of the remediation works as mentioned in (a) above, a 'Verification Report' must be submitted demonstrating that the works have been carried out satisfactorily and remediation targets have been achieved.",
    "Reason: \tTo ensure that any previously unidentified contamination found at the site is investigated and satisfactorily addressed in order to protect those engaged in construction and occupation of the development from potential contamination.",
    "The dwelling hereby approved shall be constructed to comply with Part M4(2) of the Building Regulations - Accessible and Adaptable Dwellings.",
    "Reason: In order to comply with Policy DC7 of the Local Development Framework and Policy 3.8 of the London Plan.",

    "Changes to the public highway (including permanent or temporary access)",
    "- Planning approval does not constitute approval for changes to the public highway. Highway Authority approval will only be given after suitable details have been submitted considered and agreed. If new or amended access is required (whether temporary or permanent), there may be a requirement for the diversion or protection of third party utility plant or highway authority assets and it is recommended that early involvement with the relevant statutory undertaker takes place. The applicant must contact Engineering Services on 01708 433751 to discuss the scheme and commence the relevant highway approvals process. Please note that unauthorised work on the highway is an offence.",
