    "The proposed dwelling would through its overall height, bulk and mass, development footprint, relationship to shared boundaries and design approach including concept and plot layout and arrangement appear as unacceptably dominant and visually intrusive feature harmful to the appearance of the surrounding area, inconsistent with surrounding local character and existing pattern of development contrary to Policy D4 of the London Plan (2016) and Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD. There would also be conflict with paragraph 127 of the National Planning Policy Framework (the Framework) which states that developments should function well, add to the overall quality of the area and be sympathetic to local character.",
    "The proposed dwelling would form a visually intrusive and overbearing feature and give rise to an increased sense of enclosure whilst also causing loss of light and overshadowing to the adjoining rear garden of 59 Kingsley Gardens detrimental to neighbouring amenity and therefore contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD, the Residential Design SPD. There would also be conflict with paragraph 127 of the National Planning Policy Framework which seeks to ensure a high standard of amenity for future users of development.",
