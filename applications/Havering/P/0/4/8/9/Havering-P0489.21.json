    "The rear extension, by reason of its excessive depth, bulk and position close to the boundaries of the site, results in an intrusive and unneighbourly development, out of scale with the character and appearance of the host property,  as well as having a detrimental impact on the visual amenities of adjacent occupiers  in terms of overbearing impact and an increased sense of enclosure contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD.",
    "The proposed development would, by reason of the reduction of car parking provision on the public highways, result in unacceptable overspill onto the adjoining roads to the detriment of highway safety and residential amenity and contrary to Policies DC32 of the LDF Strategy and Development Control Policy",
