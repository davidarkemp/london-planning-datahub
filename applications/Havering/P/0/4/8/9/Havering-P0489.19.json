    "Reason:-",
    "Insufficient information has been supplied with the application to judge the appropriateness of the hard and soft landscaping proposed.  Submission of a scheme prior to commencement will ensure that the development accords with the Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policy DC61.  It will also ensure accordance with Section 197 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990.",

    "Reason: The application has been assessed in context of these suggested uses and in view that this is a strategic industrial designation it is considered appropriate to restrict the permitted uses as such. This restriction is furthermore to comply with policies CP3 and DC9 of the Adopted Development Plan Document (2008).",

The submitted plan shall also include full details for the layout for car parking and surface materials. Thereafter, such provision shall be implemented prior to occupation and made permanently available for use for the duration of the development.",
    "Reason:- To ensure that car parking accommodation is made permanently available within the development and appropriate provision is made for Blue Badge parking and electrical vehicle charging points, in the interests of highway safety and that the development accords with development accords with policies DC33 and DC35 of the Adopted Development Plan Document (2008) and policy 6.13 of the London Plan.",

If new or amended access as required (whether temporary or permanent), there may be a requirement for the diversion or protection of third party utility plant or highway authority assets and it is recommended that early involvement with the relevant statutory undertaker takes place. The applicant must contact Engineering Services on 01708 433751 to discuss the scheme and commence the relevant highway approvals process. Please note that unauthorised work on the highway is an offence.",
    "The developer (including their representatives and contractors) is advised that planning consent does not discharge the requirements of the New Roads and Street Works Act 1991 and the Traffic Management Act 2004.  Formal notifications and approval will be needed for any highway works (including temporary works of any nature) required during the construction of the development.",
    "Please note that unauthorised work on the highway is an offence.",
    "The developer is advised that if construction materials are proposed to be kept on the highway during construction works then they will need to apply for a license from the Council. If the developer requires scaffolding, hoarding or mobile cranes to be used on the highway, a licence is required and Street Management should be contacted make the necessary arrangements. Please note that unauthorised use of the highway for construction works is an offence.",
    "The developer is advised that surface water from the development in both its temporary and permanent states should not be discharged onto the highway. Failure to prevent such is an offence."
