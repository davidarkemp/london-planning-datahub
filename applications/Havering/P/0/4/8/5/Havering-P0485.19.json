    "The proposed layout of the development would be inadequate resulting in substandard accommodation for future residents through insufficient space and the lack of provision of built-in storage. As a result, the development is contrary to Policies DC61 of the London Borough of Havering's LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD, the DCLG Technical Housing Standards March 2015, the London Plan, and the Housing SPG 2016.",
    "The proposed development would, by reason of the lack of provision of amenity space, result in a cramped over-development of the site to the detriment of future occupiers and the character of the surrounding area. The development is therefore contrary to the Residential Design SPD 2010 and Policy DC2, DC3 DC4 and DC61 of the London Borough of Havering's LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD and Policy 3.5 of the London Plan.",
    "The development has failed to demonstrate how cycle storage and servicing could be adequately provided within the development. As a result the development is contrary to Policy DC35 and DC36 of the London Borough of Havering's LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD, and Policy 6.9 of the London Plan.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to Simon Dossery via email on 1st August 2019."
