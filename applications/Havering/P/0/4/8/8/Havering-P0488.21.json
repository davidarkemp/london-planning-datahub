  "application_type": "All Other",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed development, having regard to the cumulative scale, width, bulk and mass of the hip to gable roof alterations, raising of the ridge and significantly large rear and front dormer windows, would fail to satisfactorily integrate with the original design of the building, would be out of scale and character with the host dwelling and the immediate surrounding area. As such, the proposal is contrary to Policy DC61 of the London Borough of Havering LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document 2008 and the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document 2011.",
    "The proposed rear dormer including the Juliet balconies would, by reason of its scale, position and proximity to neighbouring properties, be an intrusive, overbearing and unneighbourly development as well as having adverse effect on the amenities of adjacent occupiers in terms of visual impact, cause overlooking and loss of privacy which would have a serious and adverse effect on the living conditions of adjacent occupiers, contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, it was necessary to issue a decision as close to the statutory timeframe as possible as opposed to seeking amendments which would have significantly delayed the application."
