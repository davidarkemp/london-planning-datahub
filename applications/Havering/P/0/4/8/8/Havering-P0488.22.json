    "The applicant has not robustly demonstrated that the the proposals would not unduly harm the amenity of surrounding residents, nor be detrimental to the sense of place, safety and community experienced by those residents through the scale of the proposed use and associated comings and goings and high prospective turnover and occupancy than the lawful use as a single dwelling house. The proposals would therefore be contrary to Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 Policies 6, 26 and 34 as well as Policy H12 of the London Plan and the objectives of the NPPF.",
    "The use as described including management processes, layout and quality of internal space has not been robustly demonstrated by the applicant to achieve a suitably high quality living environment for future occupants and is therefore contrary to Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 Policies 6 and 7 which fundamentally requires that it must be robustly demonstrated that the site is suitable for the intended occupiers in terms of the standard of facilities and the level of interdependence and that the amenity and quality of life of future residents is not adversely impacted.",
    "Existing levels of parking stress do not lend themselves to a use which would intensify existing issues. In the absence of any mitigating factors the proposed change of use is unacceptable on this basis. The increased competition for on-street parking as a result of the deficit of off-street provision, the ambiguous use of the site and high prospective turnover would be to the detriment of the amenity of surrounding neighbouring occupiers and would contribute further to existing parking stress thereby contrary to Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 Policies 6 and 24 which seek to ensure adequate parking provision.",
