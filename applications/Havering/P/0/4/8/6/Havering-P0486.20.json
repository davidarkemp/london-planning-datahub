    "The proposal development would by reason of the overall bulk, mass, scale and design, result in the unbalancing of the symmetrical aspect of the semi-detached pair and would not appear subordinate to the main dwelling, thereby causing visual harm to the character and appearance of the host dwelling and the surrounding area, contrary to Policy DC61 of the London Borough of Havering LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document 2008, the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document 2011 and Policy 7.4 of the London Plan 2016.",
    "The proposed two storey side extension would, by reason of its excessive depth, height and position built to boundary, be an intrusive and unneighbourly development as well as having an adverse effect on the amenities of adjacent occupiers at no. 1 Pepys Terrace and pedestrians using the cross block link (pathway) contrary to Policy DC61 of the London Borough of Havering LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document 2008, the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document 2011 and Policy 7.4 of the London Plan 2016.",
    "The proposed single storey rear extension would, by reason of its excessive height on the boundary, would create amenity issues for the neighbour at no. 50 Daventry Road and appear out of character within the rear garden scene for the immediate surrounding area, contrary to Policy DC61 of the London Borough of Havering LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document 2008, the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document 2011 and Policy 7.4 of the London Plan 2016.",
