    "The proposed development would, by reason of positioning close to the side boundary, bulk and mass, particularly at the rear,  appear as a dominant and visually intrusive development, which would unduly enclose the street scene at this prominent location.  It would further give rise to a residential dwelling which, by reason of its design, scale and appearance, would appear as incongruous and out of keeping with the prevailing character of development in the locality, thereby materially harmful to the character and appearance of the surrounding area, contrary to  Policy 7 and 26 of the Havering Local Plan.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, it was necessary to issue a decision as close to the statutory timeframe as possible as opposed to seeking amendments which would have significantly delayed the application.",
    "The proposal, if granted planning permission on appeal, would be liable for the Mayor of London and Havering Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). Based upon the information supplied with the application, the Mayoral CIL payable would be £1850 based on £25.00 per square metre and the Havering Community Infrastructure Levy (HCIL) would be a charge of £9250 based on calculation of £125 per square metre. Each would be subject to indexation.",
    "Further details with regard to CIL are available from the Council's website."
