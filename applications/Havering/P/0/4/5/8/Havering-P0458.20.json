    "The front boundary wall as constructed by reason of its design, height and position form an unacceptably dominant and visually intrusive feature, harmful to the appearance of the street scene and detracts from the open character of the surrounding area, contrary to the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document and Emerson Park Policy Area SPD; and Policy DC61 and DC69 of LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Plan Document.",

However, the agent (Mr James Dunne) was informed via email with respect to refusal of the scheme on 01/06/20."
