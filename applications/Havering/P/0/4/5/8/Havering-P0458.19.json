    "The proposals would represent an overdevelopment of the host premises, the resultant internal arrangement for the self-contained flatted units would not secure the long term adequate amenity of residents and would be inconsistent with a high quality design. By way of the resultantly poor quality residential environment, the development hereby sought would be contrary to the aims of Policies DC4 and DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD and the Residential Design SPD.",
