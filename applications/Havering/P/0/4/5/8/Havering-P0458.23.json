    "The development by reason of its housing typology, the nature of the use as a large HMO with high prospective occupancy and poor access to public transport, would result in significantly higher levels of coming / goings and intensive activity over and above that of a single dwelling house resulting in a detrimental impact to the amenity of adjoining residents from noise and disturbance associated with the use contrary to Policies 8 and 34 of the Havering Local Plan 2016-2031. For the reasons given it is not considered that this could be overcome through a restrictive condition.",
    "The internal layout of the resultant dwelling would fail to meet with the requirements of the East London HMO guidance, having regard to maximum occupancy based on room sizes and requirements for shared space capable of being used by all occupants simultaneously. The proposals therefore conflict with Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 Policy 8 through failing to provide an adequate living environment for all future occupants",
    "The low PTAL rating is suggestive of poor access to public transport. The formation of new crossover would remove on-street parking bays. Mindful of the high prospective occupancy based on the size of rooms/internal layout which is not comparable to a single dwelling house and in the absence of evidence to the contrary there would be potentially high reliance on vehicle ownership. It is not considered that the proposals have demonstrated compliance with Policy 8 of the Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 in so far as that the proposals would make adequate on site provision and would not have unacceptable impact on parking conditions and traffic congestion in the area particularly with the removal of on-street bays.",
