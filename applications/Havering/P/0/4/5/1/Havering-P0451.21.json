  "description": "Conversion of detached 4-bed dwelling to 2 x two storey 2-bed semi-detached dwellings with associated parking and amenity space, involving a two storey side extension, erection of a front porch, partial demolition of existing garage and installation of a dropped kerb and hardstanding to front.",
  "application_type": "All Other",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed development would by reason of its roof form, design, prominent siting and excessive width, together with the cumulative impact of the existing extensions, appear incongruous and an unacceptably dominant and visually intrusive feature out of character with the prevailing pattern of development, detrimental to the visual amenity of the locality and the streetscene contrary to Policy DC61 of the Local Development Framework Core Strategy and  Development Control Policies Development Plan Document and the guidance contained in the National Planning Policy Framework.",
    "The proposed layout of the development would provide inadequate internal floor space for the two dwellings, resulting in substandard accommodation for future residents. As a result, the proposal represents an overdevelopment of the site contrary to Policy DC61 of the Local Development Framework Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document, the DCLG Technical Housing Standards, Policy D6 of the London Plan and the Housing SPG 2016.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to XEVA Design Ltd via email on 11th May 2021.",
    "For Residential Development Only",
    "Please be advised that approval of this application from 1st September 2019 (either by London Borough of Havering, or subsequently by PINS if allowed on appeal following a refusal by London Borough of Havering) will attract a liability payment of £6,300 plus indexation in Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This charge has been levied under s.206 of the Planning Act 2008 and includes both the Mayor of London's CIL and Havering Council's CIL.",
    "London Borough of Havering, as CIL collecting authority, has responsibility for the collection of the Mayoral CIL, in addition to Havering's CIL, on commencement of the development.",
    "Your proposal is subject to a CIL Liability Notice indicating a levy of  £1,050 plus indexation for the application, based on the Mayoral CIL levy rate for Havering of ??£25/sq.m plus Havering's charging rate for residential of ??£125/sq.m (Zone A) and the floorspace of 42 square metres.",
