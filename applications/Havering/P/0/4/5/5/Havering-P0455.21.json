    "Permission is granted for a limited period only of 5 years from the date of this decision notice and shall expire on 14th May 2026; on or before which date the use hereby permitted shall be discontinued, the buildings and any works carried out under this permission shall be removed and the site reinstated to its former condition and the use revert to retail in accordance with the conditions of planning permission P0140.97 to the satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:",
    "A permanent permission may limit the ability to successfully redevelop the site for residential led development and may affect the EUV of the land for the purposes of achieving maximum amount of affordable housing. An interim (or meanwhile) use is considered acceptable in this instance.",
    "The development hereby permitted shall not be carried out otherwise than in complete accordance with the approved plans (as set out on page one of this decision notice).",
    "Reason:-",
    "For the avoidance of doubt and to ensure that the development is carried out as approved.",
    "The premises shall not be used for the purposes hereby permitted other than between the hours of 08:00 and 20:00 on Mondays to Sundays without the prior consent in writing of the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To enable the Local Planning Authority to retain control in the interests of amenity, and in order that the development accords with Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policy DC61.",
    "Notwithstanding the provisions of the Town and Country Planning (Use Classes) Order 1987 (as amended) the use hereby permitted shall be for a Job Centre or for a retail use subject to the restrictions of the 1997 permission (P0140.97), and shall be used for no other purpose(s) whatsoever including any other use in Classes E of the Use Class Order or any use otherwise permitted by the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended), unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To restrict the use of the premises to one compatible with the surrounding area and to enable the Local Planning Authority to exercise control over any future use not forming part of this application, to protect the vitality and viability of existing centres, and that the development accords with the Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policy DC61",
    "Statement Required by Article 35(2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management) Order 2015: No significant problems were identified during the consideration of the application, and therefore it has been determined in accordance with paragraph 38 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2019",
    "The proposal is liable for the Mayor of London Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). The Mayoral CIL levy rate for Havering is £25.00 per sqm. Based upon the information supplied with the application, at 816sq.m,  £20, 400.00 would be payable if the use cannot be demonstrated within 6 months after this permission, however this may be adjusted subject to indexation.",
    "These charges are levied under s.206 of the Planning Act 2008.  CIL is payable within 60 days of commencement of development. A Liability Notice will be sent to the applicant (or anyone else who has assumed liability) shortly and you are required to notify the Council of the commencement of the development before works begin. Further details with regard to CIL are available from the Council's website. You are also advised to visit the planning portal website where you can download the appropriate document templates at",
