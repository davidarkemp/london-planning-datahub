    "The proposed development would, by reason of its additional height, bulk and mass appear as an unacceptably dominant and visually intrusive feature detrimental to this part of the Emerson Park Special Character Area. It would detract from the spacious qualities of the surrounding environment and harmful to character contrary to policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021), Policies DC61 and DC69 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD and the Emerson Park Policy Area SPD. There would also be conflict with paragraph 127 of the National Planning Policy Framework (the Framework) which states that developments should function well, add to the overall quality of the area and be sympathetic to local character.",
    "The proposed development, by reason of its excessive height, depth, bulk and proximity to the shared boundary, would considered to be unneighbourly which would give rise to an uncomfortable and overbearing effect resulting in an increased sense of enclosure, a degree of overshadowing as well as the loss of privacy in particular with reference to rooflight on the side roof slopes and would therefore be harmful to the amenities of the neighbouring properties contrary to Policy DC61 of the London Borough of Havering LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD 2008, and the London Borough of Havering Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD 2011.",
    "Please be advised that approval of this application from 1st September 2019 (either by London Borough of Havering, or subsequently by PINS if allowed on appeal following a refusal by London Borough of Havering) will attract a liability payment of £41,865 plus indexation in Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This charge has been levied under s.206 of the Planning Act 2008 and includes both the Mayor of London's CIL and Havering Council's CIL.",
    "London Borough of Havering, as CIL collecting authority, has responsibility for the collection of the Mayoral CIL, in addition to Havering's CIL, on commencement of the development.",
    "Your proposal is subject to a CIL Liability Notice indicating a levy of £41,865 plus indexation for the application, based on the Mayoral CIL levy rate for Havering of £25/sq.m plus Havering's charging rate for residential of £125/sq.m (Zone A) and the additional floorspace of 279.1 square metres.",
