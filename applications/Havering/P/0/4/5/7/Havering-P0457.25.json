    "The proposed rear dormer window would, by reason of its excessive width, height, bulk and mass, lack subservience to the existing dwelling and appear an incongruous, overbearing, dominant and visually intrusive feature in the streetscene and rear garden environment harmful to the appearance of the host property and the prevailing character and appearance of development in the surrounding area contrary to Policy 26 of the Havering Local Plan, D4 of the London Plan and the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document.",
    "The proposal would result in an intensification of use, which would be facilitated by extending the property with a proposed loft conversion, rear dormer window and roof lights. The development by virtue of its use and scale including proposed occupancy, levels of staffing and overly intense operation would be materially out of character and at odds with the suburban nature of its surroundings and resulting in undue harm to the residential amenity of neighbouring occupiers from noise and disturbance associated with the significant level of activity and comings and goings of the use contrary to Policies 6, 7, 16 and 34 of the Havering Local Plan, Policies D14, H12, S1 and S2 of the London Plan and the National Planning Policy Framework.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to Peacock + Smith Ltd via email on 6th June 2025."
