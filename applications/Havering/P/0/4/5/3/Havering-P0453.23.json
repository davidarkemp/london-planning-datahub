    "The proposed dwelling would, by reason of its scale, bulk and mass, design and prominent siting and position close to the boundaries of the site, appear incongruous, visually intrusive, unduly cramped and out of character with the prevailing pattern of development, detrimental to the visual amenity of the locality and the street scene and rear garden environment contrary to Policies 10 and  26 of the Havering Local Plan, Policy D4 of the London Plan and the guidance contained in the National Planning Policy Framework.",
    "The proposed dwelling would by reason of their insufficient floor to ceiling height be inadequate resulting in substandard accommodation for future residents through lack of internal space contrary to Policy 7 of the Havering Local Plan and Policy D6 of the London Plan.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to Mr Leborgne by e-mail on 06-06-23.",

    "Please be advised that approval of this application from 1st September 2019 (either by London Borough of Havering, or subsequently by PINS if allowed on appeal following a refusal by London Borough of Havering) will attract a liability payment of £13,650 plus indexation in Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This charge has been levied under s.206 of the Planning Act 2008 and includes both the Mayor of London's CIL and Havering Council's CIL.",
