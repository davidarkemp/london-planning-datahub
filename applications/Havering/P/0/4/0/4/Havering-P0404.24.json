    "The proposed first floor rear extension would, by reason of its excessive depth and bulk result in a form of development which is incongruous to the setting of the semi-detached bungalow. It would represent an over development of the subject dwelling with the additional bulk not reflective of the established pattern of development to the rear of neighbouring dwellings. Consequently the extension would appear as a visually intrusive and overbearing addition materially harmful to the amenity of adjacent neighbours contrary to Policies 7 and 26 of the Local Plan and the Council's Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD.",
