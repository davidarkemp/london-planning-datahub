    "The proposed rear dormer and roof height increase would, by reason of its scale, bulk and proximity to the neighbouring property at no.1 Dorian Road, be an intrusive, overbearing and unneighbourly development with loss of privacy, overshadowing, loss of outlook and an overbearing impact that would have a significant adverse impact on their amenity contrary to Policies 7 and 26 of the Havering Local Plan and the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, it was necessary to issue a decision as close to the statutory timeframe as possible as opposed to seeking amendments which would have significantly delayed the application."
