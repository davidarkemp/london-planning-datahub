    "The development to which this permission relates must be commenced not later than three years from the date of this permission.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To comply with the requirements of Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended by Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004).",
    "The proposed development hereby approved shall be constructed in accordance with the materials detailed within the approved drawings, unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason: To ensure that the appearance of the proposed development will harmonise with the character of the surrounding area.",
    "Before the commercial use commences, that part of the building shall be insulated in",
    "accordance with a scheme which shall previously have been approved by the Local Planning",
    "Authority in order to secure a reduction in the level of noise emanating from it and it shall be",
    "effectively sealed to prevent the passage of odours through the structure of the building to",
    "other premises and dwellings.",
    "Reason: To prevent noise and odour nuisance to adjoining properties.",
    "No non-road mobile machinery (NRMM) of net power of 37kW and up to 560kW shall be used on the site during the demolition, site preparation and construction phases of the development herby permitted unless it is compliant with the emission standards set out in chapter 7 of the GLA's Control of Dust and Emissions during Construction and Demolition SPG or any subsequent guidance. All developments in Greater London shall keep an inventory on site on the online register at: https://nrmm.london/ of all NRMM of net power between 37kW and 560kW.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To ensure that air quality is not adversely affected by the development in line with London Plan policy SI 1 and Local Plan policy 33.",
    "Before any works commence a scheme for any new plant or machinery shall be submitted to",
    "the local planning authority to achieve the following standard. Noise levels expressed as the",
    "equivalent continuous sound level LAeg (1 hour) when calculated at the boundary with the",
    "nearest noise sensitive premises shall not exceed Laso -10dB and shall be maintained",
    "thereafter to the satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason: To prevent noise nuisance to adjoining/adjacent properties.",
    "The development hereby permitted shall not be carried out otherwise than in complete accordance with the approved plans (as set out on page one of this decision notice).",
    "Reason:-",
    "For the avoidance of doubt and to ensure that the development is carried out as approved.",
    "Before the development hereby permitted commences details of a scheme shall be submitted",
    "to and approved in writing by the local planning authority which specifies the provisions to be",
    "made for the control of noise emanating from the site. Such scheme as may be approved shall",
    "be implemented prior to first occupation and thereafter retained in accordance with such",
    "details.",
    "Reason: To prevent noise nuisance to adjoining/adjacent properties.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35(2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management) Order 2015: No significant problems were identified during the consideration of the application, and therefore it has been determined in accordance with paragraph 38 of the National Planning Policy Framework."
