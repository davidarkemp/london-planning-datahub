    "Before any of the development hereby permitted is commenced, written specification of external walls and roof materials to be used in the construction of the building(s) shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority and thereafter the development shall be constructed with the approved materials.",
    "Reason:-",
    "Insufficient information has been supplied with the application to judge the appropriateness of the materials to be used.  Submission of a written specification prior to commencement will ensure that the appearance of the proposed development will harmonise with the character of the surrounding area.",

    "In the interests of amenity and to enable the Local Planning Authority to retain control over future development.",
    "Prior to the occupation of the dwelling hereby permitted details of the boundary treatment shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority and retained permanently thereafter to the satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority.",

Submission of this detail prior to occupation in the case of new building works or prior to the use commencing in the case of changes of use is in the interests of providing a wide range of facilities for non-motor car residents and sustainability.",
