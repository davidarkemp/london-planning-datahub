    "The development to which this permission relates must be commenced not later than three years from the date of this permission.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To comply with the requirements of Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended by Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004).",
    "The development hereby permitted shall not be carried out otherwise than in complete accordance with the approved plans (as set out on page one of this decision notice).",
    "Reason:-",
    "The Local Planning Authority consider it essential that the whole of the development is carried out and that no departure whatsoever is made from the details approved, since the development would not necessarily be acceptable if partly carried out or carried out differently in any degree from the details submitted.  Also, in order that the development accords with Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policy DC61.",
    "The premises shall not be open to the public for the purposes hereby permitted other than between the hours of 07:00 and midnight any day without the prior consent in writing of the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To enable the Local Planning Authority to retain control in the interests of amenity, and in order that the development accords with Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policy DC61.",
    "Before the development hereby permitted commences details of a scheme shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority which specifies the provisions to be made for the control of noise emanating from the site. Such scheme as may be approved shall be implemented prior to first occupation and thereafter retained in accordance with such details.",
    "Reason:  To prevent noise nuisance to adjoining/adjacent properties.",
    "Before the commercial use commences, the building shall be insulated in accordance with a scheme which shall previously have been approved by the Local Planning Authority in order to secure a reduction in the level of noise emanating from the premises and it shall be effectively sealed to prevent the passage of noise through the structure of the building to other premises and dwellings.",
    "Reason:  To prevent noise and nuisance to adjoining properties.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: In accordance with paragraph 38 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2018, improvements required to make the proposal acceptable were negotiated with the agent via email on 13/5/20. The revisions involved reducing the operating hours. The amendments were subsequently agreed on 13/5/20."
