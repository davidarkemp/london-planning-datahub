    "The proposed two storey front extension would, by reason of its scale, bulk and mass and its position close to the boundaries of the site, appear cramped, incongruous and visually intrusive in the street scene. This would be harmful to the open and spacious character and appearance of the surrounding area and contrary to the Havering LDF Emerson Park Policy Area SPD Adopted February 2009 and the London Borough of Havering LDF Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD 2011. Further, the proposal is contrary to the implementation of Policies DC61 and DC69 of the London Borough of Havering LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD 2008, together with Policy 7.4 of the London Plan 2016.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to Mr Ellis (Agent) by e-mail on 08/05/19."
