    "The proposal would fail to preserve or enhance the character or appearance of the Conservation Area and would set an undesirable precedent, detrimental to the open and verdant character of the Gidea Park Conservation Area. The proposal would neither preserve or enhance the character and appearance of the Gidea Park Conservation Area and is therefore contrary to Policies 7, 26 and 28 of the Havering Local Plan Adopted November 2021 and Section 10 of the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document Adopted 2011.",
