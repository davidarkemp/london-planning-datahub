The proposal, if approved, would also be likely to set a precedent for other units on this estate to propose an increase in their hours of operation. The proposals are considered to result in a significant detrimental impact upon the amenities of occupiers of adjacent properties contrary to Policies 7 and 34 of the Havering Local Plan.",
