    "The proposed development would by reason of its bulk, scale, massing and site coverage result in a discordant built form and cramped form of development, uncharacteristic to the established pattern of development in the surrounding area, detrimental to the character and appearance of the locality, contrary to the high-quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policies D3 and D4 of The London Plan (2021) and Policies 7,10 and 26 of the Local Plan",
    "The proposed development by reason of its height, bulk and massing and the proximity to the site's boundaries would constitute an unneighbourly development resulting in a significant loss of outlook, an overbearing impact and an increased sense of enclosure to the detriment of the amenity enjoyed at No2 Marks Way and No19 and No21 Mawney Road contrary to Policy 7 and 10 of the Local Plan.",
    "The proposed development, due to site coverage and the proximity of the ground floor main habitable room windows to the rear boundary of the site would result in poor outlook and aspect, and poor amenity space to the detriment of the amenity of the future occupiers resulting in substandard residential accommodation, contrary to Policy D6 of the London Plan and Policy 7 and 10 of the Local Plan",
    "The proposal fails to achieve the minimum floor-to-ceiling height of 2.5m for at least 75 per cent of their Gross Internal Area and therefore the proposal would provide substandard accommodation detrimental to amenities of the future occupiers of the site contrary to Local Plan Policy 7 and London Plan Policy D6.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to  the agent by email on 16/05/23.",
    "Please be advised that approval of this application from 1st September 2019 (either by London Borough of Havering, or subsequently by PINS if allowed on appeal following a refusal by London Borough of Havering) this application proposes a new residential unit, and an increase in floorspace by 109sqm in area. The site lies in Romford and , and therefore would have a Havering CIL liability of £2,725 and a Mayoral CIL liability of £13,700 subject to indexation.",
