As a result, the development represents an overdevelopment of the site contrary to Policy DC61 of the Local Development Framework Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document, the DCLG Technical Housing Standards and Policy D6 of the London Plan.",

    "The proposal would fail to make provision for adequate off street parking for the donor and proposed dwellings to the detriment of neighbouring amenity through increased parking stress and competition for on street parking spaces contrary to Policies DC33 and DC61 of the Local Development Framework Development Plan Development and Policies T6 and T6.1 of the London Plan.",
