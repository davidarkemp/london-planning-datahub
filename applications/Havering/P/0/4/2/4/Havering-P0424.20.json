    "The proposed development would - by reason of inappropriate design and location of terraces - have an unacceptable impact on the neighbouring amenity and would be unacceptable when assessed against policy DC61 of the Havering Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD 2008, as well as policies 7.4, 7.5 and 7.6 of the London Plan 2016 (MALP), policies D4 and D8 of the emerging Draft London Plan (\"Intend to Publish\" version December 2019), and the Residential Design SPD and the Emerson Park Policy Area SPD.",
    "The proposed development would - by reason of its height, bulk, mass and proximity to the boundaries of the site - appear as an unacceptably dominant and visually intrusive feature within the streetscene, and would be harmful to the appearance of the Emerson Park Special Character Area, contrary to Policies DC61 and DC69 of the Havering Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD 2008, as well as policies 7.4, 7.5 and 7.6 of the London Plan 2016 (MALP), policies D4 and D8 of the emerging Draft London Plan (\"Intend to Publish\" version December 2019), and the Residential Design SPD and the Emerson Park Policy Area SPD.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to the agent prior to the decision notice being issued.",
    "Furthermore, paragraph 38 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2019) (the NPPF) requires Local Planning Authorities to approach decisions on proposed development in a positive and creative way, and paragraph 41 of the NPPF places an expectation that issues on applications should be addressed prior to submission of an application. The Council has made available on its website the policies and guidance provided by the Development Plan in its entirety. The Council also offers a full pre-application advice service in order to ensure that the applicant has every opportunity to submit an application that's likely to be considered acceptable. On"
