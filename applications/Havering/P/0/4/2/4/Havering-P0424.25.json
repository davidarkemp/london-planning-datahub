  "description": "Conversion of the existing dwelling house into 2 flats with associated cycle pods, refuse and recycling following construction of a single storey rear extension at the ground floor, two storey side extension and first floor rear extension",
  "site_name": "5 Percy Road",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The original dwelling has a gross internal floor space of 85 square metres, which fails to meet the standard of 120 square metres contrary to Policy 9 of the Havering Local Plan. The proposal would therefore have an adverse impact on the supply of family housing within the Borough, the loss of which is not adequately justified and which could set an undesirable precedent for similar development in the locality.",
    "The proposed conversion would lead to undue harm to the amenities of the existing occupiers of the neighbouring dwelling and the future occupiers of the proposed flats due to juxtaposition of living areas to bedrooms contrary to policy 9 of the Havering Local Plan 2021.",
    "The proposal will result in poor standard of accommodation for the future occupiers of the proposed flat at first floor level, as it fails to provide any external private amenity space, contrary to policy 7 of the Local Plan 2021 and policy D6 of the London plan.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to the agent."
