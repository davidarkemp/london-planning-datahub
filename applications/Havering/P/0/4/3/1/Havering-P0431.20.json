    "The proposed development would - by reason of inappropriate land use within the retail core of the Upminster Major District Centre - have an unacceptable impact on the long-term viability of the high street and is unacceptable when assessed against policies DC16 and DC23 of the Havering Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD 2008.",

    "The proposed development would - by reason of its inappropriate shop front design - fail to integrate well into the existing building and the area more generally, and have an detrimental impact on the streetscene, and would be unacceptable when assessed against policies 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan 2016 (MALP), draft London Plan policy D4, and policies CP17 and DC61 of the Havering Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD 2008, and the Shop Front Design SPD.",
