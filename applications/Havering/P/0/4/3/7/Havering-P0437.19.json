  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed (side/rear) extension would, by reason of its excessive depth, height and position close to the boundaries of the site, be an intrusive and unneighbourly development as well as having an adverse effect on the amenities of adjacent occupiers contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD.",
    "The proposed dormer would, by reason of its height, position and bulk appear out of scale and character with the dwelling and materially harmful to the visual amenity of the surrounding area contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD.",
    "The proposed development would, by reason of the inadequate provision of amenity space, and the poor outlook from bedroom 2 on the ground floor would result in a cramped over-development of the site to the detriment of future occupiers and the character of the surrounding area contrary to Policy CP2 and DC3 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD.",
    "The proposal, if granted planning permission on appeal, would be liable for the Havering Borough Council and the Mayor of London Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). Based upon the information supplied with the application, the CIL payable would be £900 for the Mayor of London and £4500 for Havering borough council (subject to indexation).",
    "Further details with regard to CIL are available from the Council's website.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: In accordance with paragraph 38 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2018, improvements required to make the proposal acceptable were negotiated with the applicant agent requiring amendment to dormer, rear extension and reviewing conversation layout early I October. However, no revision has been submitted so  far."
