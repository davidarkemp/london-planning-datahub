    "The proposed side dormer windows, by reason of their width, scale, bulk and massing, would occupy an unacceptably large area of the roof slopes, forming a dominant, incongruous and visually intrusive feature that would be detrimental to the character and appearance of the subject property and materially harmful to the visual amenity of the surrounding area, contrary to Local Plan Policy 7 and the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document.",
    "The proposed eastern facing side dormer window, by reason of its proximity to the neighbouring property 32 Pettley Gardens, Romford would cause overlooking and loss of privacy into their rear garden environment which would have a serious and adverse effect on the living conditions of these neighbouring occupiers, contrary to Local Plan Policy 7 and the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document.",
