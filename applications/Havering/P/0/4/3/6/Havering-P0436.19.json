    "The proposed side and rear extension would, by reason of its excessive depth, height and position close to the boundaries of the site, be a visually intrusive development harmful to the character of the street scene as well as having an adverse effect on the amenities of adjacent occupiers contrary to Policy DC61 of the London Borough of Havering  LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD 2008, together with the London Borough of Havering Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD 2011 and the National Planning Policy Framework 2019 .",
    "The proposed development viewed cumulatively would by reason of the increase scale, bulk and mass of the property appear as unacceptably dominant and visually intrusive additions which would lack subservience and would fail to rationalise the existing disparate forms in both massing and materiality to the detriment of the streetscene and harmful to the appearance of the surrounding area contrary to Policies DC61 and Policy DC69 of the London Borough of Havering LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD 2008.",
    "The proposal, if granted planning permission on appeal, would be liable for the Mayor of London Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). Based upon the information supplied with the application, the CIL payable would be Â£4250. Further details with regard to CIL are available from the Council's website.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: In accordance with paragraph 38 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2019, improvements required to make the proposal acceptable were negotiated with agent in writing.

Refinements to the dormer windows were suggested also  The applicant declined to make the suggested revisions."
