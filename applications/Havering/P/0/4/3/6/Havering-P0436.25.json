  "site_name": "9 Great Nelmes Chase",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed first floor rear extension would, by reason of its depth, bulk and proximity to the boundary with the neighbouring property no.11 Great Nelmes Chase, give rise to an intrusive, overbearing and unneighbourly development that would have a significant adverse effect on the amenities of these adjacent occupiers contrary to Policy 7 of the Havering Local Plan and the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document.",
    "The proposed first floor rear extension would appear as an unacceptably dominant and visually intrusive feature in the garden scene harmful to the established character and appearance of the surrounding area and appearing as a disproportionate and bulky addition to the host property, contrary to Policy 7 and 26 of the Havering Local Plan, and the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, it was necessary to issue a decision as close to the statutory timeframe as possible as opposed to seeking amendments which would have significantly delayed the application."
