    "The development to which this permission relates must be commenced not later than three years from the date of this permission.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To comply with the requirements of Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended by Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004).",
    "The development hereby permitted shall not be carried out otherwise than in complete accordance with the approved plans (as set out on page one of this decision notice).",
    "Reason:-",
    "For the avoidance of doubt and to ensure that the development is carried out as approved.",
    "The annexe hereby permitted shall be used only for living accommodation as an integral part of the existing dwelling known as 13 Elliott Gardens, Romford and shall not be used as a separate unit of residential accommodation at any time and the internal link at ground floor level shall be maintained.",
    "Reason:-",
    "The site is within an area where the Local Planning Authority consider that the sub-division of existing properties should not be permitted in the interests of amenity.",
    "The annexe hereby permitted shall not be arranged or disposed of as a separate unit of residential accommodation from the use of the main dwelling.",
    "Reason:-",
    "In order that the annex approved remains ancillary to the main dwelling and that the development accords with the Havering Local Plan.",
    "The garden area shall not be sub-divided at any time and nor shall there be any additional pedestrian or vehicular accesses into the site.",
    "Reason:-",
    "In order that the annex approved remains ancillary to the main dwelling and that the development accords with the Havering Local Plan.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35(2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management) Order 2015: No significant problems were identified during the consideration of the application, and therefore it has been determined in accordance with paragraph 38 of the National Planning Policy Framework."
