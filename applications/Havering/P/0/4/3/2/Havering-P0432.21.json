    "The proposed rear extension would, by reason of its bulk, mass, size, design and position would appear as an unacceptably overbearing dominant feature which would be detrimental to the character and appearance of the property and materially harmful to the visual amenity of the rear garden environment contrary to policies D3 and D4 of The London Plan (2021), policy DC61 of the London Borough of Havering LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD 2008, and the London Borough of Havering Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD 2011.",
    "The proposed single storey rear extensions would, by reason of its excessive depth, height and close proximity to the western shared boundary, be unneighbourly which would give rise to an uncomfortable and overbearing effect resulting in an increased sense of enclosure and loss of outlook to the amenity of the occupiers of no. 76 Chase Cross Road contrary to Policy DC61 of the London Borough of Havering LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD 2008, and the London Borough of Havering Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD 2011.",
