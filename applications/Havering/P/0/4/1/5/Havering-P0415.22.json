    "The proposed use and associated areas of hardstanding in particular the areas immediately to the rear of 87, 89 and 91 Hillfoot Road would present as an encroachment well beyond existing commercial character and would in the absence of evidence to the contrary present as a variance with the obvious character of the area, and one that would degrade the quality of the area neither preserving or enhancing local character. The development is contrary to the supporting justification of Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 Policy 10, which requires consideration of character and also Policies 26 and 27, the London Plan and the objectives of Paragraph 130 of the NPPF which, amongst other things, requires development add to the overall quality of the area.",
    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate satisfactorily that use of the site and access to and from it would be practical for future users of the site to manoeuvre and to enter/exit in forward gear without detriment to other users of the shared space, nor that any associated intensification which may arise would not be detrimental to users of the shared space and is thereby contrary to Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 Policies 23 and 24.",
    "The proposed use of the site for B8 in the absence of technical detail to confirm otherwise would be harmful to neighbouring amenity through associated noise and disturbance and would therefore conflict with Policies 13, 26 and 34 of the Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 in addition to the Framework which at Paragraph 130(f) requires development provide a high standard of amenity for existing and future users, the objectives of the London Plan.",
    "The hardstanding subject of the current application fails to make adequate provision for the quality of water catchment, ground water or surface water with limited opportunity to provide high quality landscaping at odds with Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 Policies 27 and 32 which seek to avoid flood risk to people and property and to take full account of full account of the landscape character of the site and its wider setting.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to the agent in writing 09-05-2022."
