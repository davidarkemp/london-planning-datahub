    "The hip-to-gable roof alteration, when viewed from the street, has significantly altered the original hipped roof design of the dwellinghouse, resulting in a visually top heavy roof appearance on one side of the dwelling, having a negative impact on the street scene via the loss of symmetry at roof level. Furthermore, the rear dormer window in-situ, by reason of its bulk, scale and massing when viewed in combination with the hip-to-gable roof alteration and roofs of the side and rear extensions to which it is joined, together appear as a dominant and visually intrusive feature within the rear roof slope of the dwellinghouse, detrimental to its character and appearance as well as the visual amenity of the rear garden environment. Accordingly, the roof alterations to the dwelling are of a poor quality design contrary to the purposes and intent of Local Plan Policies 7 and 26 as well as the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document.",
