    "The proposed rear extension and raised patio, by reason of the overall bulk, mass, scale and design, would appear incongruous and out of character for the host dwelling, the rear garden scene and surrounding area, as well as resulting in amenity impacts to both adjoining neighbours regarding overshadowing, a sense of enclosure and overdevelopment, overlooking and a loss of privacy, contrary to Havering's Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD (adopted 2011) and Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD (adopted 2008).",
