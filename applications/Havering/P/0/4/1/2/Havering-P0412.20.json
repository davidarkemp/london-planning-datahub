  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed development would appear to extend the existing residential curtilage beyond that presented by the applicant under earlier submissions made for the site. The provision of buildings incidental to the main dwelling house in the locations shown would materially change the use of the site and would represent a harmful urbanisation of the site through harm to openness and material encroachment into the countryside. The site is within the area identified in the London Borough of Havering LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document 2008 as Metropolitan Green Belt. The LDF and Government Guidance as set out in the National Planning Policy Framework 2019 is that in order to achieve the purposes of the Metropolitan Green Belt, it is essential to retain and protect the existing rural character of the area so allocated and that the new development will only be permitted outside the existing built up areas in the most exceptional circumstances.  No spec",
    "The site is within the area identified in the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document as Metropolitan Green Belt.  The proposed development would, by reason of its combined scale, bulk and mass, and by way of the cumulative impact would result in disproportionate additions over and above the size of the original building and therefore, would be inappropriate in principle within the Green Belt. No special circumstances have been submitted in this case which overcomes the harm identified and the proposal is therefore contrary to Policies CP14 and DC45 of the adopted LDF Development Control Policies Development Plan Document, Policy 7.16 of the London Plan 2016 and the National Planning Policy Framework 2019.",
    "The proposed development would - by reason of its combined height, bulk and mass and lack of subservience - appear cumulatively as an unacceptably dominant and visually intrusive features within the landscape and to the area more generally and would be contrary to policies 7.4, 7.5 and 7.6 of the London Plan 2016, policies D4 and D8 of the emerging Draft London Plan (\"Intend to Publish\" version December 2019), and policies CP17 and DC61 of the Havering Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD 2008, and the Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD 2008.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to the agent in writing 07-09-2020."
