    "The site is within the area identified as Metropolitan Green Belt. The proposed development would by reason of its scale, bulk and mass and taking into account existing additions and historic development at the site, by way of the cumulative impact result in disproportionate additions over and above the size of the original building. The development would therefore be inappropriate development within the Green Belt. No special circumstances have been submitted in this case and the proposals are therefore contrary to the objectives of the NPPF and London Plan (Policy G2).",
