    "The site is within the area identified as Metropolitan Green Belt. Government Guidance as set out in the National Planning Policy Framework is that in order to achieve the purposes of the Metropolitan Green Belt it is essential to retain and protect the existing open character of the area so allocated and that the new buildings will only be permitted in certain circumstances. The proposed development, by reason of its scale, bulk, mass and increase in ridge height would result in a disproportionate addition to the original dwelling that would cause harm to the openness of the Green Belt. No special circumstances have been submitted in this case. The development proposals are therefore contrary to Policy G2 of the London Plan and the guidance in the National Planning Policy Framework.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to Mr Brandon (Agent) by e-mail on the 23rd May 2025."
