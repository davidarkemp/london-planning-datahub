    "It is considered that the proposed single storey rear extension would by virtue of its excessive depth, scale and mass, lack subservience to the existing dwelling and would appear dominant and visually intrusive in the rear garden environment contrary to policy DC61 of the Adopted Havering Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD 2008 and the Adopted Havering Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD 2011.",
    "The rear extension would, by reason of its excessive scale, siting and position close to the boundary shared with No. 3 Oak Glen, be unneighbourly which would give rise to an uncomfortable overbearing effect and sense of enclosure, loss of outlook and be harmful to the amenity of No.3 Oak Glen contrary to policy DC61 of the Adopted Havering Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD 2008 and the Adopted Havering Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD 2011.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to the applicant Mr Dheeraj Thota via email on the 12/5/21"
