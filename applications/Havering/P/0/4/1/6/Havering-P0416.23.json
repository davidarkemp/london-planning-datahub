    "The development to which this permission relates must be commenced not later than three years from the date of this permission.",

    "The development hereby permitted shall not be carried out otherwise than in complete accordance with the approved plans (as set out on page one of this decision notice).",
    "Reason:-",
    "For the avoidance of doubt and to ensure that the development is carried out as approved.",
    "Prior to the occupation of the 6 bedroom HMO, the refuse and cycle storage facilities as shown on drawing PR-001 Rev G shall be provided and made available for use by residents and be permanently retained thereafter.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To protect the amenity of occupiers of the development and also the locality generally.",
    "The use of the 325 Hilldene Avenue, Romford shall be as a House in Multiple Occupation (HMO) as defined in the Housing Act (2004), and by Use Class C4 of the Town and Country Planning (Use Classes) Order 1987 (as amended), and shall not be occupied by more than 6 persons at any time.",
    "Reason:-",
    "In order to ensure that the use of the building and level of occupancy does not give rise to an unacceptable level of impact on adjoining residential occupiers or have an adverse impact on the character and appearance of the area in accordance with Policy 8 of the Havering Local Plan 2016-2031.",
    "Secure by Design Informative",
    "In promoting the delivery of safer, stronger, sustainable places the Local Planning Authority fully supports the adoption of the principles and practices of the Secured by Design Award Scheme and Designing against Crime.

    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: In accordance with paragraph 38 of the National Planning Policy Framework, improvements required to make the proposal acceptable were negotiated with SAM Planning by phone and e-mail.

The amendments were subsequently submitted on 19/06, 07/07 & 10/07/23."
