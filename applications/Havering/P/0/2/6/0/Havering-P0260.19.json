  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposal, by reason of the proposed layout and access arrangements, would be an unneighbourly development and adversely impact on the residential amenity of adjacent occupiers, including undue overlooking, loss of privacy and result in reduced amenity space provision to No. 115C Victoria Road contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Development Control Policies Development Plan Document.",
    "The proposed layout of the development would be inadequate resulting in substandard accommodation for future residents through failure to adhere to designing out crime principles contrary to Policies DC3, DC61 and DC63 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document and London Plan Policy 7.3.",
    "The proposal, by reason of a lack of an outdoor amenity area, would be harmful to the amenity of future occupiers of the HMO contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD and the Design for Living Supplementary Planning Document.",
    "The proposed 11 room HMO would result in an intensification of the site and result in significant harm to residential amenity from noise, disturbance and activity, contrary to Policies DC4, DC5 and DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to Spaces Architecture via email on 4th July 2019.",
    "The proposal, if granted planning permission on appeal, would be liable for the Mayor of London Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). Based upon the information supplied with the application, the CIL payable would be Â£5,020. Further details with regard to CIL are available from the Council's website."
