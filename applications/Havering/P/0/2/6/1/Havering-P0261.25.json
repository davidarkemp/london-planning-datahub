    "The proposed internal layout would provide inadequate bedroom floor space that would result in a substandard accommodation for the number of proposed future residents. and the resultant development would also fail to offer at least one 3b4p family unit, for which there is particular need in the Borough.  The proposal also fails to demonstrate whether the development would provide adequate internal head height.  Accordingly, the proposed scheme is considered to offer poor quality living accommodation, contrary to Policies 7, 9 and 26 of the Havering Local Plan 2016, the DCLG Technical Housing Standards and Policy D6 of the London Plan.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy a decision was made on the application, which will enable the applicant to exercise a right of appeal if they so wish."
