  "description": "Construction of one x 9bed detached dwelling with habitable roof space and detached double garage following demolition of existing dwelling",
  "site_name": "16 Nelmes Road",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "Through the combined scale, bulk and mass of the dwelling proposed, design concept and proximity to the boundaries of the site, it would present as visually dominant and overbearing from the rear garden of the adjoining site (no. 18 Nelmes Road) in a manner which would be unneighbourly and oppressive appearing as a wall of development from inside and outside spaces. The development would therefore not comply with Havering Local Plan Policies 7, 26 and 34, nor Para 135(f) of the Framework which requires a high standard of amenity for existing and future occupiers.",
    "The proposed detached garage through its overall proportions and siting, with limited separation from the back edge of the footway would form a prominent and visually intrusive feature in the street-scene. It would be detrimental to the spacious character of the Emerson Park Policy Area and would contribute to a cramped visual impression and as such would conflict with the objectives of the Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 Policy 26, the Framework in particular Para 135, the London Plan 2021 and the Emerson Park Policy Area SPD.",
    "The proposal, if granted planning permission on appeal, would be liable for the Mayor of London and Havering Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). Based upon the information supplied with the application, the Mayoral CIL payable would be £9,325 based on the calculation of £25.00 per square metre and the Havering Community Infrastructure Levy (HCIL) would be a charge of £46,625 based on calculation of £125 per square metre. Each would be subject to indexation.",
    "Further details with regard to CIL are available from the Council's website.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to the agent in writing 27-05-2025"
