    "Insufficient justification has been provided as to the current condition of the window, whether repair/refurbishment would be possible together with secondary glazing as a possible alternative. The removal of all historic frames and glass panes would cause harm to the historic and architectural significance of the property. The proposed replacement window would introduce a discernibly modern double-glazed appearance, which would materially and unacceptably detract from the character and appearance of the application premises, to the detriment of the street-scene. The proposal would neither preserve, nor enhance the special character of the Gidea Park Conservation Area and is therefore contrary to Policy 26 and 28 of the Havering Local Plan and Policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021.",
