    "The proposed extension, due to the design approach adopted and overall proportions would lack subservience and appear as a prominent and obtrusive feature within the Conservation Area. In addition, the development would have an unacceptable impact on the amenity of the adjoining premises with the increased proportions of the existing projection contributing to an increased sense of enclosure, loss of outlook and unacceptable loss of light/overshadowing. The proposals would thereby fail to preserve or enhance the special character of this part of the Conservation Area contrary to Policies DC61, DC68 and also the Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD and the provisions of the NPPF.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to the agent in writing 30-09-2019."
