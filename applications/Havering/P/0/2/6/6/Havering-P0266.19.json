    "In the absence of a legal agreement to secure restrictions on the ability to obtain parking permits, the proposal would fail to satisfactorily provide sufficient parking provision resulting in inconvenience for future residents and/or increased parking stress in the surrounding area, contrary to the provisions of Policies DC2, DC33 and DC72 of the Development Control Policies DPD.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: In accordance with paragraph 38 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2018, a legal agreement involving restrictions on parking permits required to make the proposal acceptable was attempted to be negotiated with the agent via email and phone from May - November 2020.  After a series of extensions of time to try and finalise the legal agreement, the applicant was unable to be contacted.",
