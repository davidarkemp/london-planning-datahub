    "The proposed rear dormer windows, by reason of their bulk and massing would occupy an unacceptably large area of the rear roof slope,  forming a dominant, incongruous and visually intrusive feature, detrimental to the character and appearance of the property and materially harmful to the visual amenity of the surrounding area contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document, the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document and Policy 7.4 of the London Plan.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to Mr HASAN ICOZZ via email on the 20/05/20.",
    "Please note that there are discrepancies between what has been built and the proposed plans. If another application is submitted in the future, please rectify the issue.",
    "It is noted that the proposal is for the extension to two residential units which appear to be HMO's. Please be advicsed that you may need planning approval for a change of use."
