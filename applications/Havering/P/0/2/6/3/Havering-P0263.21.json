  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposal would result in the loss of permanent residential accommodation without any evidence that there is a compelling need for the proposed use which would amount to the special circumstances required for the loss of residential accommodation contrary to policy DC1 of London of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD.",
    "The applicant has not demonstrated that the proposed change of use would not generate increased vehicle movement to the site, more-so than the former use as a single dwelling house, nor that the vehicle movement to the site can be accommodated to the site frontage as indicated. It has not been demonstrated that the two off-street parking spaces indicated by the applicant would meet with the relevant standard which may lead to increased competition for on street spaces. This would be to the detriment of the amenity of surrounding neighbouring occupiers. The proposed development would in the absence of clarity result in unacceptable overspill onto the adjoining roads to the detriment of highway safety and the free flow of traffic contrary to Policies DC4, DC5 and DC33 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD and London Plan 2021 Policies D5 and T6.",
    "The proposed layout would not demonstrate a suitably high standard of accommodation for future occupants with bedroom one at first floor level of insufficient size. In the case of ground floor bedroom positioned centrally within the building there would be poor levels of outlook and light and the layout would be cramped and overdeveloped with poor quality access to communal bathroom and wc facilities, therefore contrary to Policies DC4, DC5 and DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD.",
    "In the absence of a detailed statement outlining how the premises would function and be managed, the proposed use would create an uplift in occupancy which would be out of keeping with the surrounding suburban context and would materially change the character of the subject property and the surrounding environment. This would present in increased comings and goings to the site which would be over and above what could be regarded as acceptable and which would be detrimental to local character and the amenity of adjoining and nearby occupiers. The development would then be both detrimental to local character and the amenity of nearby occupiers contrary to Policies DC4, DC5 and DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to the applicant on 12-04-2021."
