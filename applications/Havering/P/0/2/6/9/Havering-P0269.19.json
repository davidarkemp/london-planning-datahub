    "The proposed development would by reason of its likely height, bulk, mass and prominent siting, appear incongruous, overbearing, visually intrusive and overbearing detrimental to the character and appearance of the surrounding area contrary to Policy DC61 of the London Borough of Havering LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD 2008.",
    "The proposed development would be likely to give rise to development which by reason of its potential bulk, scale and height and position close to the boundaries of the site would appear overly dominant, visually intrusive and overbearing with regards to outlook from surrounding residences, giving rise potentially to an overwhelming sense of enclosure detrimental to the amenity of those occupants thereby contrary to Policy DC61 of the  London Borough of Havering LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD 2008.",
    "The proposed development would, by reason of the inadequate on site car parking provision, result in unacceptable overspill onto surrounding roads which benefit from an existing level of parking stress which would be worsened. The increased competition for on-street parking would be to the detriment of neighbouring amenity thereby contrary to Policies DC33 and DC61 of the  London Borough of Havering LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD 2008.",
