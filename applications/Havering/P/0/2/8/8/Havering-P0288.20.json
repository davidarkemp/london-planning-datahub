    "The overall bulk, mass, scale and siting of the proposed development would result in the unbalancing of the semi-detached pair, contribute to the enclosure of the characteristic gap between semi-detached pairs, and would be harmful to the character of the original dwelling as well as the streetscape, contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD and the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document (Adopted 2011).",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to Plan Services on 15 May 2020 via email.",
    "Please note that there are some discrepancies with the submitted drawings. The existing platform/ deck area at the rear is not shown on plans and therefore the height of the proposed rear extension from the ground level is unknown. The siting of the neighbours building (rear wall) in relation to the subject dwelling differ between the proposed ground floor and first floor plans. If a further application is submitted, please rectify these discrepancies."
