  "description": "First floor rear extension (extension of existing dormer)",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The site is within the area identified as Metropolitan Green Belt. The Local Development Framework and Government Guidance as set out in the NPPF is that in order to achieve the purposes of the Metropolitan Green Belt it is essential to retain and protect the existing open character of the area so allocated and that the new extensions/buildings will only be permitted in certain circumstances.The proposed first floor extension would result in disproportionate addition to the property over and above its original form and would also by way of the overall bulk and amount of development, be disproportionate and reduce and therefore cause harm to the openness of the Green Belt. No special circumstances have been submitted in this case. The development proposals are therefore contrary to Policy DC45 of the London Borough of Havering LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document 2008 and the provisions of the National Planning Policy Framework 2019.",
    "The proposed first floor rear extension would, by reason of its excessive scale, bulk and mass, appear as an unacceptably dominant and visually intrusive feature in the rear garden, result in disproportionate additions to the original property creating a visually heavy roof and accordingly would appear incongruous and out of keeping in the area, contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document, the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document and Policy D4 of the London Plan (adopted March 2021).",
    "The proposed first floor rear extension would, by reason of its depth, excessive height and position close to the boundaries of the site, be an intrusive and unneighbourly development as well as having an adverse effect on the amenities of adjacent occupiers contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document, the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document.",
    "The first floor obscure glazed flank window to the bedroom would cause perceived overlooking, which would have a serious and adverse effect on the living conditions of adjacent occupiers at No.73 Shepherds Hill, Romford. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy D4 of the London Plan (2021), Policy DC61 of the London Borough of Havering LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD 2008 and the adopted Residential Extensions and Alterations and Residential Design SPD. The proposal would also fail to accord with the core principle set out in Paragraph 127 of the National Planning Policy Framework which seeks to ensure a high standard of amenity for existing and future occupants of land and buildings.",
    "Obscure glazing the lower half of the first floor flank window to the bedroom adjacent to No.73, which is a habitable room and a bedroom, would materially affect the outlook of future occupiers and create a poor quality living environment harmful to their residential amenity. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies D4 of the London Plan (2021), Policy DC61 of the London Borough of Havering LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD 2008 and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design (2010). The proposal would also fail to accord with the core principle set out in Paragraph 127 of the National Planning Policy Framework which seeks to ensure a high standard of amenity for existing and future occupants of land and buildings.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to Mr Stroud (agent) by e-mail on 14-04-21."
