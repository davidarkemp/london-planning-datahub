    "The proposed semi-detached dwellings would, by reason of the layout and siting of the development, be provided with an  unacceptably small side garden areas, with poor levels of outlook from the primary ground floor habitable rooms, and roof level bedrooms, resulting in substandard residential accommodation, detrimental to the amenity of the future occupiers, which would be contrary to Policy D6 of the London Plan and Policy 7 of the Local Plan 2021.",
    "The proposed dwellings would, by reason of their scale, bulk, height and proximity to the neighbouring boundaries surrounding the site, be an intrusive, overbearing and unneighbourly development that would have a significant adverse effect on the amenities of these adjacent occupiers and appear as an unacceptably dominant and visually intrusive feature in the garden scene harmful to the appearance of the surrounding area contrary to Policy 7 and 26 of the Havering Local Plan and the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document.",
    "The proposed alteration to the width of no. 6B, would by reason of the resultant design appear to be incongruous and visually intrusive in the streetscene, out of character with the prevailing pattern of development in the wider locality, and detrimental to the visual amenity of the streetscene and contrary to National Planning Policy Framework (2024), policies D3 and D4 of The London Plan (2021), London Plan Housing SPG and policies 10 and 26 of the Local Plan.",
    "The proposed development would, by reason of the scale, bulk and design of the proposed semi-detached dwellings, together with its proximities to the boundaries of the site and resultant degree of site coverage, give rise to  development that appears incongruous and visually intrusive in the rear gardenscene, out of character with the prevailing pattern of development, as well as appearing as an overdevelopment, overbearing and cramped form of development within the wider locality, detrimental to the visual amenity of the neighbouring garden scene, harmful to neighbouring residential amenity and contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2024), policies D3 and D4 of The London Plan (2021), London Plan Housing SPG and Policies 7, 10 and 26 of the Local Plan.",
    "The proposed lack of car parking spaces for the semi-detached dwellings, would lead to an increase of on-road parking demand thereby having potential impact upon the highways safety and the adverse impact upon the free flow of traffic in the area contrary to Policy 24 and 26 of the Havering Local Plan.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, it was necessary to issue a decision as close to the statutory timeframe as possible as opposed to seeking amendments which would have significantly delayed the application.",
    "The proposal, if granted planning permission on appeal, would be liable for the Mayor of London and Havering Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). Based upon the information supplied with the application, the Mayoral CIL payable would be £3675 based on £25.00 per square metre and the Havering Community Infrastructure Levy (HCIL) would be a charge of £18,3750 based on calculation of £125 per square metre. Each would be subject to indexation.",
