    "The part single, part two storey rear extension, when joined to the host dwelling's existing rear extension, by reason of the cumulative depth of the extended dwelling at ground floor level would be an intrusive and unneighbourly development and have an adverse effect on the amenity of adjacent occupiers at no. 44 Hyland Close, Hornchurch, contrary to the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document and Local Plan Policy 7.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Improvements to the proposal to reduce the depth of the first floor element of the proposed part single, part two storey rear extension were negotiated with the agent during the course of the application. However, the resultant projection of the host dwelling as a result of the extension was considered at detailed assessment stage to still be unacceptable. Further significant alteration would have been required to bring the development within the realms of acceptability so it was decided to proceed to determine the application."
