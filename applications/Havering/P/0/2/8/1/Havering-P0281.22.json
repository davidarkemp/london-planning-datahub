    "In the interests of amenity and to enable the Local Planning Authority to retain control over future development.",
    "If not present at the time of this decision being issued, within a period of one month, the 1000mm high metal balustrade indicated on drawing nos. A105 Rev G and A250 Rev F shall be installed to the satisfaction of the LPA and thereafter maintained permanently and not removed at any time for the lifetime of the development.",

    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: In accordance with paragraph 38 of the National Planning Policy Framework, improvements required to make the proposal acceptable were negotiated with the agent in writing. The revisions involved the omission of visuals as they did not accurately show the balustrade required. Confirmation from the agent was given in writing 11-05-2022."
