  "description": "Conversion of single storey bungalow to two storey house involving demolition of existing detached garage, raising roof, two storey side and rear extensions and to include 3 front dormers and creation of attached garage",
  "application_type": "All Other",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed front dormers including the hip to gable roof alterations would, by reason of their position, scale, bulk and unbalancing effect of the pair of semi detached properties, would appear out of scale and character with the dwelling and materially harmful to the visual amenity of the surrounding area contrary to the Adopted  Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document 2011, Policy DC61 of the London Borough of Havering LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document 2008 and the provisions of the National Planning Policy Framework 2019.",
    "The proposed two side and rear extensions would, by reason of their excessive depth, width, height and position close to the boundaries of the site, be an intrusive, overbearing and unneighbourly development as well as having an adverse effect on the amenities of adjacent occupiers in terms of visual impact, contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD.",
    "The proposed development would, by reason of its height, bulk, mass, and design appear as an unacceptably dominant, and visually intrusive feature in the streetscene and garden scene, harmful to the appearance of the surrounding area contrary to Policy DC61 of the London Borough of Havering LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD 2008.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, it was necessary to issue a decision as close to the statutory timeframe as possible as opposed to seeking amendments which would have significantly delayed the application."
