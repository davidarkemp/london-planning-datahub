    "The presence of European protected species, such as bats, is a material consideration in the planning process and the potential impacts that a proposed development may have on them should be considered at all stages of the process. Occasionally European protected species, such as bats, can be found during the course of development even when the site appears unlikely to support them.  In the event that this occurs, it is advised that the developer stops work immediately and seeks the advice of the local authority ecologist and/or the relevant statutory nature conservation organisation (e.g. Natural England). Developers should note that it is a criminal offence to deliberately kill, injure or capture bats, or to deliberately disturb them or to damage or destroy their breeding sites and resting places (roosts). Further works may require a licence to proceed and failure to stop may result in prosecution.",
