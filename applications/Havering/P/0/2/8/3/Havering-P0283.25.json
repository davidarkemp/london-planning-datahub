    "The proposed extension, by reason of its scale, bulk, mass, height and proximity to shared boundary of the adjoining site, would form an intrusive and overbearing feature which would be detrimental to the outlook and result in an increased sense of enclosure to the occupiers of the dwelling at 296 South End Road. The development is therefore be contrary to Havering Local Plan Policies 7 and 26 and the design guidance within the Council's Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, it was necessary to issue a decision as close to the statutory timeframe as possible as opposed to seeking amendments which would have significantly delayed the application."
