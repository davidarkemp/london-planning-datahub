    "Prior to the occupation of the dwelling hereby permitted the boundary treatment shall be carried out in accordance with the approved drawings and retained permanently thereafter to the satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority.",

    "- Planning approval does not constitute approval for changes to the public highway. Highway Authority approval will only be given after suitable details have been submitted considered and agreed. If new or amended access is required (whether temporary or permanent), there may be a requirement for the diversion or protection of third party utility plant or highway authority assets and it is recommended that early involvement with the relevant statutory undertaker takes place.
