  "decision_conditions": [
    "The development hereby permitted shall not be carried out otherwise than in complete accordance with the approved plans (as set out on page one of this decision notice).",
    "Reason:-",
    "The Local Planning Authority consider it essential that the whole of the development is carried out and that no departure whatsoever is made from the details approved, since the development would not necessarily be acceptable if partly carried out or carried out differently in any degree from the details submitted.  Also, in order that the development accords with Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policy DC61.",
    "The proposed development hereby approved shall be constructed in accordance with the materials detailed under Section 7 of the application form unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason: To ensure that the appearance of the proposed development will harmonise with the character of the surrounding area and comply with Policy DC61 of the Development Control Policies Development Plan Document",
    "Prior to the commencement of the development hereby approved, details of all proposed walls, fences and boundary treatment shall be submitted to, and approved in writing by, the Local Planning Authority.  The boundary development shall then be carried out in accordance with the approved details and retained permanently thereafter to the satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:",
    "Insufficient information has been supplied with the application to judge the appropriateness of any boundary treatment.  Submission of this detail prior to commencement will protect the visual amenities of the development, prevent undue overlooking of adjoining property and ensure that the development accords with the Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policy DC61.",
    "The garden area shall not be subdivided at any time and no gates or walls should be erected to divide the site nor shall there be any additional pedestrian or vehicular accesses into the site.",
    "Reason:-",
    "In order that the annex approved remains ancillary to the main dwelling and that the development accords with Policy DC61 of the Development Control Policies Development Plan Document.",
    "Any residential occupation of the building hereby approved shall be limited to immediate family members of the family occupying the main house at 63 Crystal Avenue, Hornchurch for residential purposes and shall not be occupied by any other persons.",
    "Reason:-",
    "In order that the annex approved remains ancillary to the main dwelling and that the development accords with Policy DC61 of the Development Control Policies Development Plan Document.",
    "The outbuilding hereby permitted shall not be arranged or disposed of as a separate unit of residential accommodation from the use of the main dwelling.",
    "Reason:-",
    "In order that the annex approved remains ancillary to the main dwelling and that the development accords with Policy DC61 of the Development Control Policies Development Plan Document.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35(2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management) Order 2015: No significant problems were identified during the consideration of the application, and therefore it has been determined in accordance with paragraph 38 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2019."
