    "The proposed development would, by reason of its size, scale, height, position and cumulative design failings as an independent dwelling appear as an uncharacteristically cramped on site and visually intrusive feature in the streetscene, out of scale and character with the established building line and pattern of development on Harlow Road, harmful to the appearance of the surrounding area and contrary to Policy 26 of the Local Plan 2021.",
    "The proposal would, by reason of its site constraints, in particular the provision of very shallow front garden; proximity to the boundaries give rise to a cramped form of development which result in a substandard level of residential accommodation that would materially harm the living conditions of future occupiers having particular regard to poor outlook and privacy impact, which would be contrary to Policy 7 of the Local Plan 2021.",
    "The proposed development would, by reason of its size, scale, height, position and proximity to neighbouring properties be an intrusive and overbearing development, particularly at no. 2 Harlow Road, which would have a serious and adverse effect on the living conditions of adjacent occupiers in terms of loss of privacy and outlook, contrary to Policy 7 of the Local Plan 2021.",
    "In the absence of a full Tree Survey, the proposed development would result in the removal and/or harm to trees on/adjacent site, which would be materially harmful to the character and amenity of site and surrounding area, contrary to Policy 27 of the Local Plan 2021 and the NPPF 2021.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2019: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, it was necessary to issue a decision as close to the statutory timeframe as possible as opposed to seeking amendments which would have significantly delayed the application.",
    "The proposal, if granted planning permission on appeal, would be liable for the Mayor of London Community Infrastructure Levy (MCIL) and Havering CIL (HCIL). Based upon the information submitted with the application, the Mayoral CIL payable would be £1,300 and the Havering CIL £6,500, or a total liability of £7,800, both amounts subject to indexation.",
