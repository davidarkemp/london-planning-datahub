    "The external area of the staircase to the rear of 277 London Road at first floor is to be used solely as access to the flat, and shall not be used as a balcony, roof garden or similar amenity area without the grant of further specific permission from the Local Planning Authority.",

    "In the interests of safety, and amenity of the occupiers of neighbouring dwelling.",
    "All new external finishes shall be carried out in materials to match those of the existing building to the satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To safeguard the appearance of the premises and the character of the immediate area.",
    "Within 6 month of the construction of the external staircase to the rear garden of 277 London Road, the full structure is to be colour coated to be black (RAL 9005, or similar).",

    "To safeguard the appearance of the premises and the character of the immediate area.",
    "The development hereby permitted shall not be carried out otherwise than in complete accordance with the approved plans (as set out on page one of this decision notice).",
    "Reason:-",
    "The Local Planning Authority consider it essential that the whole of the development is carried out and that no departure whatsoever is made from the details approved, since the development would not necessarily be acceptable if partly carried out or carried out differently in any degree from the details submitted.  Also, in order that the development accords with Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policy DC61.",
    "The glazing inserted into the door to the rear elevation at first floor for the rear staircase serving 277 London Road is to be obscure gazed to a minimum standard of Grade 3.",

    "Changes to the public highway (including permanent or temporary access)",
    "- Planning approval does not constitute approval for changes to the public highway. Highway Authority approval will only be given after suitable details have been submitted considered and agreed. If new or amended access is required (whether temporary or permanent), there may be a requirement for the diversion or protection of third party utility plant or highway authority assets and it is recommended that early involvement with the relevant statutory undertaker takes place. The applicant must contact Engineering Services on 01708 433751 to discuss the scheme and commence the relevant highway approvals process. Please note that unauthorised work on the highway is an offence.",
