    "The overall bulk, mass and scale of the proposed development would result in the unbalancing of the semi-detached pair, contribute to the enclosure of the characteristic gap between semi-detached pairs, and the extensions not appearing subordinate to the main dwelling, would be harmful to the character of the original dwelling as well as the streetscape, contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD and the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document (Adopted 2011).",
    "The proposed development would, by reason of its position and proximity to neighbouring properties and overall bulk would cause overshadowing, loss of access to sunlight/ daylight and create a sense of enclosure and overbearing development, which would have a serious and adverse effect on the living conditions of adjacent occupiers at no. 17 Millbrook Gardens, contrary to the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document (Adopted 2011) and Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD.",
    "You are advised that there are discrepancies in the plans, including the roof ridge line shown to be longer than it is on existing elevation drawings.",
    "Please note that if a new application be submitted the plans should show a true reflection of the existing building and proposal.",
