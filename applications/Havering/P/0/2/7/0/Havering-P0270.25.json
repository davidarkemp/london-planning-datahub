  "decision_conditions": [
    "The outbuilding, by reason of the combination of its height, large scale and proximity to the attached common boundaries of the site, is a visually intrusive, dominant and overbearing development that harms the visual amenity of the occupiers of the adjoining neighbours as well as causing overlooking issues, contrary to Policy 7 of the Local Plan and the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document.",
    "The outbuilding forms an incongruous feature in the garden-scene and is conspicuous through its positioning, scale and lack of spacing which fails to take into account the character of the garden scene generally, and it would present as visually cramped within the site.  The proposal is therefore be contrary to Policies 10, 7 and 26 of the Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 and also the NPPF which requires fundamentally that development add to the overall quality of the area whilst also establishing or maintaining a strong sense of place.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, it was necessary to issue a decision as close to the statutory timeframe as possible as opposed to seeking amendments which would have significantly delayed the application."
