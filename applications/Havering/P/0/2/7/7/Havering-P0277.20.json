  "description": "Two storey, 1-bed detached dwelling with amenity space involving demolition of existing garage and removal of existing vehicle crossover",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed dwelling, would as a result of the constraints of the site, inappropriate design and appearance, appear as a disproportionately narrow feature in the street-scene. It would therefore read as an intrusive feature harmful to the appearance of the surrounding area contrary to policies 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan (2016), Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD. There would also be conflict with paragraph 127 of the National Planning Policy Framework (the Framework) which states that developments should function well, add to the overall quality of the area and be sympathetic to local character.",
    "There would be a deficit in off-street parking which would lead to increased competition for on-street parking in a location which is observed to have existing parking stress. Increased competition for spaces would be to the detriment of the amenity of surrounding neighbouring occupiers and symptomatic of the inappropriateness of the use sought. The proposed development would, by reason of the inadequate on site car parking provision, result in unacceptable overspill onto the adjoining roads to the detriment of highway safety and the free flow of traffic contrary to Policy DC33 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD.",
    "Please note also that should permission were to be granted, (either by London Borough of Havering, or subsequently by PINS if allowed on appeal following a refusal by London Borough of Havering) will attract a liability payment of £8,700 plus indexation in Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This charge has been levied under s.206 of the Planning Act 2008 and includes both the Mayor of London's CIL and Havering Council's CIL.",
    "London Borough of Havering, as CIL collecting authority, has responsibility for the collection of the Mayoral CIL, in addition to Havering's CIL, on commencement of the development. Based upon calculations undertaken by the case officer and information supplied with the application your proposal is subject to a CIL Liability Notice indicating a levy of £1,450 plus indexation for the application, based on the Mayoral CIL levy rate for Havering of £25/sq.m plus Havering's charging rate for residential of £125/sq.m (Zone A) and the floorspace of 225 square metres",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Amendments were sought by staff which addressed issues with parking, however it was not considered that the above reasons for refusal were capable of being overcome. Consideration was given to seeking fruther amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to the agent in writing 20-04-2020",
    "Due to the COVID-19 pandemic and social distancing measures implemented, a site visit was not undertaken by the case officer. For the purposes of assessing the proposed development a combination of historic photographs, including those from the previous submission, street-view, relevant aerial photography and historic records including drawings were utilised."
