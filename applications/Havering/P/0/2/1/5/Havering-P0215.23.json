    "The original dwelling has a gross internal floor space of 97.5 square metres, which fails to meet the standard of 120 square metres contrary to Policy 8 of the Havering Local Plan. The proposal would therefore have an adverse impact on the supply of family housing within the Borough, the loss of which is not adequately justified and which could set an undesirable precedent for similar development in the locality.",
    "The communal living area (lounge) of approximately 7 sqm on the ground floor fails to meet the area of 17 square metres of communal space if including a dining area and also that the kitchen would be more than one floor away from the occupiers on the second floor, which would provide a poor quality living environment harmful to the amenity of future occupiers contrary to Policy 8 of the Havering Local Plan and the HMO East London Guidance.",
    "Room 3 on the first floor has a gross internal area of 7 square metres and the room at second floor level adjacent to Room 4 with an area of 5 square metres would fail to meet the gross internal floor space of 8.5 square metres for one occupier and would be harmful to the amenity of future occupiers contrary to Policy 8 of the Havering Local Plan and the HMO East London Guidance.",
    "The proposal would result in an intensification of the site and result in significant harm to residential amenity from noise, disturbance and activity, contrary to Policies 7 and 8 of the Havering Local Plan.",
    "The HMO would result in an intensification of use and the provision of one parking space for up to 6 occupiers and would give rise to increased parking stress and competition for on street parking spaces contrary to Policies 8 and 24 of the Havering Local Plan, Policy T6.1 of the London Plan and the guidance contained in the National Planning Policy Framework.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to Mr Oyenuga via email on 17th November 2023."
