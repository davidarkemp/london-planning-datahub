    "The proposed single storey rear extension would, by reason of its excessive height, depth and position close to the boundaries of the site, be an intrusive and unneighbourly development as well as having an adverse effect on the amenities of adjacent occupiers  at No.13 St Lawrence Road, Upminster contrary to Policies 7 and 26 of the Havering Local Plan and the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document.",
    "The first floor window in the gable wall of the outbuilding facing the properties on St Lawrence Road would, by reason of its position and proximity to neighbouring properties cause overlooking and loss of privacy which would have a serious and adverse effect on the living conditions of adjacent occupiers, Policy 7 of the Havering Local Plan and the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document.",
    "The altered outbuilding and pergola, by reason of its combined height, bulk, mass and position close to the boundaries of the site and projection forward of the building line is considered to be an unneighbourly development which is out of scale with its surroundings and creates a dominant and visually intrusive feature in the rear garden environment, that is harmful to the amenity of adjacent occupiers, contrary to Policies 7 and 26 of the Havering Local Plan and the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document.",
