    "The plans accompanying the application are of poor quality showing inconsistencies between the elevations and floor plans, in particular the size, position and presence of windows. In these circumstances, there is no certainty that the proposed development would provide a satisfactory visual appearance that would not be harmful to the character and appearance of the area. In this respect, the proposal would be contrary to the Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD 2011, policy 26 of the Local Plan 2021, policies D1, D3 and D4 of the London Plan 2021 and the NPPF 2023.",
    "The plans accompanying the application are of poor quality showing inconsistencies between the elevations and floor plans, in particular the size, position and presence of windows. In these circumstances, there is no certainty that the proposed development would provide a satisfactory relationship with the neighbouring property, particularly in relation to overlooking and loss of privacy. In this respect, the proposal would be contrary to the Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD 2011 and Policies 7 and 8 of the Local Plan 2021.",
    "The proposal fails to provide adequate levels of off-street parking for the level of occupation proposed, resulting in increased pressure on on-street parking to the detriment of the safe and efficient operation of the highway and convenience of occupiers of neighbouring properties. In this respect, the proposal would be contrary to Policies 8 and 24 of the Local Plan.",
    "The development by reason of the siting of the property and the nature of the use as a large HMO with high occupancy and very poor access to public transport, would result in significantly higher levels of comings / goings and intensive activity over and above that of a single dwelling house or small HMO resulting in a detrimental impact to the amenity of adjoining residents from noise and disturbance associated. This would be exacerbated by the use of the shared side access on the boundary of the adjoining neighbour at no. 28 MaClennan Avenue, and the proposals would therefore be contrary to Policies 7 and 8 of the Havering Local Plan 2021. For the reasons given it is not considered that this could be overcome through a restrictive condition.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to the agent in writing 16-04-2024."
