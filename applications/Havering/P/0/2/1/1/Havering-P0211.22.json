In these regards the proposal is contrary to policies 26 (Urban design), Policy 27 (Landscaping), Policy 30 (Biodiversity and geodiversity), and the advice in National Planning Policy Framework 2021, which seek minimising impacts on and providing net gains for biodiversity.",
    "There is insufficient information to fully consider the impact of the proposed development upon the safe and free flow of traffic in the adjacent roads. There is insufficient information to indicates that that proposed 7 vehicles on the proposed marked bays would be able to manoeuvre in a fashion that they could entre and egress the site in forward gear manner. There is no information whether the access road would be able to sustain the additional volume of traffic generated by the additional demand without compromising the amenities of the adjoining neighbours which may result in potential conflict between the vehicle users of the existing and future user of the access way contrary to policy 23 of the Local Plan (2021) and the guidance contained in the National Planning Policy Framework.",
