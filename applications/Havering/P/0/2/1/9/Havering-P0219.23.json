    "The proposed development would, by reason of its position and proximity to neighbouring properties cause overlooking and loss of privacy which would have a serious and adverse effect on the living conditions of adjacent occupiers, contrary to Policy 26 of the Havering Local Plan 2021 and Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD 2011.",
