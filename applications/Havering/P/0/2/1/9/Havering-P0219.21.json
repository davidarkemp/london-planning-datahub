  "description": "2 x 4-bed and 1 x 3-bed detached bungalows with associated parking and amenity space, involving demolition of existing outbuildings and structures",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed bungalows, would by reason of their scale, height, bulk, design, mass and proximity to the boundaries of the site, give rise to a cramped form and unneighbourly development which would appear dominant, visually intrusive and overbearing in the rear garden environment harmful to the amenity of adjacent occupiers and contrary to the implementation of Policy DC61 of the London Borough of Havering LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD 2008 and Policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "The proposed development would result in living conditions that do not create a suitably high quality living environment for future occupiers in terms of outlook, bedroom sizes and privacy. The constraints of the site in conjunction with the design approach adopted would be to the detriment of the amenity of future occupiers. The constrained plot including the layout and shortage of quality amenity space which would have very limited level of privacy, would be substandard and give rise to an overwhelming sense of enclosure in direct contrast to the aims and objectives of Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD and Policy D6 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "The application fails to demonstrate that the proposal, having regard to the narrow access road, is able to make adequate provision for the servicing of the site, including adequate provision for refuse collection and access arrangements for emergency and rescue vehicles,  resulting in inadequate servicing arrangements contrary to Policy DC36 of the LDF Development Control Policies Development Plan Document and Policy T7 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "The proposal, by reason of its failure to provide a safe dedicated pedestrian and cyclist access to the site, coupled with the poor quality of visibility from Lake Avenue to the site and poor layout, would result in an overly cramped development to the detriment of highway safety and the residential amenity of future occupiers. The development would be contrary to Policies DC32, DC34 & DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD and Policy D6 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "Based on the level of details available to the Council, it would be considered that the proposals would give rise to a significant loss of existing mature trees and wildlife within the boundary of site including, resulting in the loss of existing leafy character of site and natural habitat for wildlife, contrary to the aims and objectives of Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD and Policy G7 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "The proposal, if granted planning permission on appeal, would be liable for the Mayor of London Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and Havering CIL. Based upon the information supplied with the application, the CIL payable would be £8,400 and £42,000. Further details with regard to CIL are available from the Council's website.",
