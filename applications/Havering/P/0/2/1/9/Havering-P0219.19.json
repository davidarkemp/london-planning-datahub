  "description": "Development of site to provide a 4 storey building to provide a mix use development of offices and storage with associated car and cycle parking, landscaping and plant",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The development to which this permission relates must be commenced not later than three years from the date of this permission.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To comply with the requirements of Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended by Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004).",
    "Before the building hereby permitted is first occupied, the area set aside for car parking shall be laid out in accordance the drawing P201 rev P03, including the 2 disabled parking bay to the front. Thereafter such provision shall be made permanently available for use to the satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority unless otherwise agreed in writing with the Local Planning Authority.  No loading or unloading of goods (including fuel) from vehicles arriving at or departing from the premises shall be carried out otherwise than within loading bay indicated on the aforementioned drawing. There shall be no storage of goods or other obstructions within the approved area without prior consent in writing of the Local Planning Authority. And the car parking spaces are retained permanently thereafter for the accommodation of vehicles visiting the site and shall not be used for any other purpose.",
    "The proposed development hereby approved shall be constructed in accordance with the materials annotated on the drawings SK-004 with respect to the elevation hereby approved plus all other facing materials including fenestration, roof, doors, gates and balustrades, unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason: To ensure that the appearance of the proposed development will harmonise with the character of the surrounding area and comply with Policy DC61 of the Development Control Policies Development Plan Document",
    "No works above the ground shall take place in relation to any of the development hereby approved until there has been submitted to and approved by the Local Planning Authority a scheme of hard and soft landscaping, which shall include indications of all existing trees and shrubs on the site, and details of any to be retained, together with measures for the protection in the course of development. All planting, seeding or turfing comprised within the scheme shall be carried out in the first planting season following completion of the development and any trees or plants which within a period of 5 years from completion of the development die, are removed or become seriously damaged or diseased shall be replaced in the next planting season with others of a similar size and species, unless otherwise agreed in writing by the local Planning Authority. The landscaping scheme shall be implemented in accordance to the approved details and permanently retained and maintained as such thereafter, u",
    "No work above the ground for the development hereby approved shall commence until the details of all proposed walls, fences and boundary treatment shall be submitted to, and approved in writing by, the Local Planning Authority.  The boundary development shall then be carried out in accordance with the approved details and retained permanently thereafter to the satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:",
    "Insufficient information has been supplied with the application to judge the appropriateness of any boundary treatment.  Submission of this detail prior to commencement will protect the visual amenities of the development, prevent undue overlooking of adjoining property and ensure that the development accords with the Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policy DC61.",
    "No deliveries to or from the units hereby permitted shall take place other than between the hours of 08:30 - 18:00 on Monday to Friday,  08:30 - 17:00 on Saturday and  10:00 - 16:00 on Sunday",
    "Reason",
    "In the interest of amenity.",
    "The development hereby permitted shall not be carried out otherwise than in complete accordance with the approved plans (as set out on page one of this decision notice).",
    "Reason:-",
    "For the avoidance of doubt and to ensure that the development is carried out as approved.",
    "No building shall be occupied or use commenced until refuse and recycling facilities are provided in accordance with details which shall previously have been submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority. The refuse and recycling facilities shall be permanently retained thereafter.",
    "Reason:-",
    "Insufficient information has been supplied with the application to judge how refuse and recycling will be managed on site.  Submission of this detail prior to occupation in the case of new building works or prior to the use commencing in the case of changes of use will protect the amenity of occupiers of the development and also the locality generally and ensure that the development accords with the Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policy DC61.",
    "No building shall be occupied or use commenced until cycle storage and shower facilities are provided in accordance with details previously submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority. The cycle storage and the shower facilities shall be permanently retained thereafter.",
    "Reason:-",
    "Insufficient information has been supplied with the application to demonstrate what facilities will be available for cycle parking.  Submission of this detail prior to occupation in the case of new building works or prior to the use commencing in the case of changes of use is in the interests of providing a wide range of facilities for non-motor car residents and sustainability.",
    "All building operations in connection with the construction of external walls, roof, and foundations; site excavation or other external site works; works involving the use of plant or machinery; the erection of scaffolding; the delivery of materials; the removal of materials and spoil from the site, and the playing of amplified music shall only take place between the hours of 8.00am and 6.00pm Monday to Friday, and between 8.00am and 1.00pm on Saturdays and not at all on Sundays and Bank Holidays/Public Holidays.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To protect residential amenity, and in order that the development accords with the Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policy DC61.",
    "No works shall take place in relation to any of the development hereby approved until a Construction Method Statement to control the adverse impact of the development on the amenity of the public and nearby occupiers is submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority. The Construction Method statement shall include details of:",
    "a)  parking of vehicles of site personnel and visitors;",
    "b)  storage of plant and materials;",
    "c)  dust management controls;",
    "d)  measures for minimising the impact of noise and ,if appropriate, vibration arising from construction activities;",
    "e)  predicted noise and, if appropriate, vibration levels for construction using methodologies and at points agreed with the Local Planning Authority;",
    "f)  scheme for monitoring noise and if appropriate, vibration levels using methodologies and at points agreed with the Local Planning Authorities;",
    "g)  siting and design of temporary buildings;",
    "h)  scheme for security fencing/hoardings, depicting a readily vis",
    "a)\t Prior to the commencement of any groundworks or development of the site, details shall be submitted to and agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority setting out suitable gas protection measures to be employed on site including, but not necessarily limited to, the installation of a suitable gas resistant membrane, in compliance with BS 8485:2015.  The gas protection measures shall be carried out in strict accordance with the agreed details.",
    "b)\t Upon completion of installation, a 'Verification Report' must be submitted demonstrating that the works have been carried out.",
    "Reason:-",
    "Insufficient information has been supplied with the application to judge the risk arising from landfill gases (methane and carbon dioxide).  Submission of an assessment prior to commencement will protect people on or close to the site from the risks associated with migrating landfill gas, and will ensure that the development accords with Development Control Policies Development Plan Document.",
    "Notwithstanding the provisions of the Town and Country Planning (Use Classes) Order 1987 (as amended) the use hereby permitted shall be for mixed use of offices and storage only and shall be used for no other purpose(s) whatsoever including any other use in Class E of the Order, unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To restrict the use of the premises to one compatible with the surrounding area and to enable the Local Planning Authority to exercise control over any future use not forming part of this application, and that the development accords with the Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policy DC61",
    "No works shall take place in relation to any of the development hereby approved until details of surface water drainage works are submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority.  Surface water drainage shall be provided in accordance with the approved details.",
    "Reason:-",
    "Surface water drainage works are required on site to prevent the risk of flooding.  Submission of a scheme prior to commencement will ensure that the measures to be employed are technically sound and that the development accords with the Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policies DC49 and DC61.",
    "No works shall take place in relation to any of the development hereby approved until a site investigation is undertaken to assess the level and extent of any landfill gas present, together with an assessment of associated risks. The investigation shall be in accordance with a scheme submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority prior to any development commencing.",
    "If during development works any contamination should be encountered which was not previously identified in the Site Investigation then works should halt immediately and the Local Planning Authority consulted to agree appropriate further action.",
    "Reason:-",
    "The development is situated on or within 250 metres of a current or historic landfill site or gravel pit.  Insufficient information has been supplied with the application to judge the risk arising from landfill gas.  Submission of an assessment prior to commencement will protect those redeveloping this site and any future occupants from potential lan",
    "No works shall take place in relation to any of the development hereby approved (except works required to secure compliance with this condition) until the following Contaminated Land reports (as applicable) are submitted to and approved in writing by  the Local Planning Authority:",
    "a) A Phase I (Desktop Study) Report documenting the history of this site, its surrounding area and the likelihood of contaminant/s, their type and extent incorporating a Site Conceptual Model.",
    "b) A Phase II (Site Investigation) Report if the Phase I Report confirms the possibility of a significant risk to any sensitive receptors.  This is an intrusive site investigation including factors such as chemical testing, quantitative risk assessment and a description of the site ground conditions.  An updated Site Conceptual Model should be included showing all the potential pollutant linkages and an assessment of risk to identified receptors.",
    "c) A Phase III (Risk Management Strategy) Report if the Phase II Report",
    "No plant including any extract ventilation, air conditioning or similar equipment shall be installed in respect to the development hereby approved unless full details of its specifications, location, external discharge points, design and acoustic performance have first been submitted to and approved in writing by this Local Planning Authority. The system(s) shall be installed and fully maintained in accordance with the approved details.",
    "Reason;",
    "In the interest of the amenity",
    "Prior to first occupation of the development, a travel plan which shall include measures to inform all those who use the offices of on-site cycle parking and showering facilities; nearest bus and train services shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority and thereafter operated in accordance with the agreed details.",
    "Reason",
    "To reduce reliance on the use of private motor cars and in the interest of sustainable agenda.",
    "Before the development hereby approved is first occupied, all parking spaces hereby approved shall be equipped with both either passive or active electric vehicle charging points in accordance with details previously submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:",
    "In order to encourage the uptake of the use of electric vehicles.",
    "The agent for the applicant has confirmed that whist there are windows on the flank elevation, the offices have no expectation of a particular level of natural light and would not, therefore, represent an impediment to the redevelopment of the neighbouring site.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: In accordance with paragraph 38 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2018, improvements required to make the proposal acceptable were negotiated with the agent of the applicant.
