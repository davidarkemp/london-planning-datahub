    "The proposed development, by reason of the substandard provision of accommodation with particular reference to the cramped internal layout and its relationship to the site boundaries (east and west) with insufficient internal floorspace, inadequate light and poor outlook from habitable room windows, with  loss of privacy would create an unacceptable living environment which would be detrimental to the amenity of the future occupiers and the character of the surrounding area contrary to Policy D6 of the London Plan and Policy 7 of the Local Plan. The proposal would also be contrary to the implementation of the DCLG Technical Housing Standards - Nationally Described Space Standard March 2015.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, it was necessary to issue a decision as close to the statutory timeframe as possible as opposed to seeking amendments which would have significantly delayed the application."
