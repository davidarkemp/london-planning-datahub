  "description": "Proposed ground and first floor front and rear extensions, with a new roof and increase in height to create habitable space on the second floor with front and rear dormer windows and alterations to include additional windows and roof lights.",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed development, by reason of its scale, bulk, mass, cramped appearance and crowned roof form would appear as a dominant and visually intrusive feature in the street scene and rear garden environment, harmful to the character and appearance of the host property and visual amenity of the surrounding area contrary to policies DC61 and DC69 of the London Borough of Havering LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD 2008, the London Borough of Havering Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD 2011 and  Emerson Park Policy Area SPD.",
    "The proposed development, by reason of its height, scale bulk, mass and projection beyond the neighbouring dwellings and position close to the boundaries of the site, would appear incongruous and be an intrusive and unneighbourly development, to the detriment of the residential amenities of the occupants of Nos. 8 and 12 Ernest Road, Hornchurch, contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document and the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: In accordance with paragraph 38 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2018, improvements required to make the proposal acceptable were negotiated with Mrs Chandni by phone and e-mail. The revisions involved the impact of the first floor rear extension and large crowned roof. The applicant declined to make the suggested revisions.",
