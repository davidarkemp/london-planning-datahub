    "The development in the form of the black painted metal panels on front and side boundary walls and front gate to be retained, would by reason of its design, height and position close to the property boundary form an unacceptably dominant and visually intrusive feature, harmful to the appearance of the street scene and detracting from the open character of the surrounding area, contrary to the London Borough of Havering Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document 2011 and Policy DC61 of London Borough of Havering LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Plan Document 2008.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to Zaavia Design (Ltd) by e-mail on 23/04/20."
