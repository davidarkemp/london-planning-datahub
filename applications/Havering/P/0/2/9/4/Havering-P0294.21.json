  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed development would, by reason of its uncharacteristically narrow configuration and plot-width as well as cramped appearance with excessive front projection, be out of keeping with the pattern of development in the local area and hence harmful and inconsistent with the prevailing character of the local area, contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide. The height, degree of front projection and proximity to the boundary would also create an overbearing form of development, which is harmful to the amenity of no.77 Tuck Road.  The proposal would also fail to accord with the core principle set out in Paragraph 127 of the National Planning Policy Framework which seeks to ensure a high standard of amenity for existing and future occupants of land and buildings.",
    "The proposed development would result in living conditions that do not create a suitably high quality living environment for future occupiers. The proposal would be substandard for a two person dwelling, with overall dimension as well as individual habitable rooms failing to meet the internal space standards of the nationally described space standards. The lack of internal space, narrow and cramped configuration would be in direct contrast to the aims of London Plan Policy D6, the nationally described space standard and Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD.",
    "The proposed development would provide inadequate access to on-site car parking due to obstructions in the public domain of a street tree. Further, the proposal by providing significant amount of hardstanding together with provision of associated domestic facilities (cycle store, recycle bins and refuse storage) to the front garden and the formation of communal driveways unrelated to a specific dwelling would be inconsistent with the pattern of development in the local area contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD.",
    "Please be advised that approval of this application from 1st September 2019 (either by London Borough of Havering, or subsequently by PINS if allowed on appeal following a refusal by London Borough of Havering) will attract a liability payment of £4500 plus indexation in Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This charge has been levied under s.206 of the Planning Act 2008 and includes both the Mayor of London's CIL and Havering Council's CIL.",
    "London Borough of Havering, as CIL collecting authority, has responsibility for the collection of the Mayoral CIL, in addition to Havering's CIL, on commencement of the development.",
    "Your proposal is subject to a CIL Liability Notice indicating a levy of £4500 plus indexation for the application, based on the Mayoral CIL levy rate for Havering of £25/sq.m plus Havering's charging rate for residential of £125/sq.m (Zone A) and the additional floorspace of 56.4 square metres.",
    "You are advised to visit the planning portal website where you can downl",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to Mrs Leena Shah via email on the 15th April 2021."
