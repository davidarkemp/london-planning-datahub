    "The proposed first floor extension and dormer, by reason of its depth, height and position close to the shared boundary, would be an overbearing and visually intrusive form of development that would have an adverse effect on the amenity of the adjacent occupiers at No.11 Douglas Avenue, contrary to Local Plan Policy 7 and the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document.",
    "The proposed dormer windows on the western side of the property, by virtue of their siting, height and size would result in overlooking and loss of privacy to No.11 Douglas Avenue, contrary to Local Plan Policy 7 and the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy a decision was made on the application, which will enable the applicant to exercise a right of appeal if they so wish."
