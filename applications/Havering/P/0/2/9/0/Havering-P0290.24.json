    "The dwelling would be cramped and overdevelopment of the site with poor spacing to no.37 Lancing Road, out of character with the established pattern of development which would be detrimental to the visual amenity of the locality and adversely affect the amenity enjoyed by prospective occupiers due to poor outlook and aspect from the ground floor windows to the main habitable room.  The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policies 10, 7 and 26 of the Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 and also the NPPF which requires fundamentally that development add to the overall quality of the area whilst also establishing or maintaining a strong sense of place.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, it was necessary to issue a decision as close to the statutory timeframe as possible as opposed to seeking amendments which would have significantly delayed the application.",
