    "The site is located within the area identified as Metropolitan Green Belt and the Havering Ridge Area of Special Character. The proposals by reasons of its excessive width and height, with likely introduction of an additional hardstanding area on site, would be significantly harmful to the character and appearance of the Green Belt, potentially reducing the very important visual gap between no. 74 Lower Bedfords Road and St. Rothwell.  No very special circumstances have been submitted in this case, and as such, the proposal is therefore considered to be an",
    "inappropriate development which would be harmful to the character and openness of the Green Belt, contrary to Policy DC45 of the London Borough of Havering Local Development Framework Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document 2008,  Policy G2 of the London Plan as well as the provisions of the National Planning Policy Framework 2019.",
    "The proposal, if granted planning permission on appeal, would be liable for the Havering Council's and Mayor of London Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). Based upon the information supplied with the application, the CIL payable would be Â£12,600. Further details with regard to CIL are available from the Council's website.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, it was necessary to issue a decision as close to the statutory timeframe as possible as opposed to seeking amendments which would have significantly delayed the application."
