    "The proposed front dormers appear as an unacceptably visually intrusive feature and would also appear incongruous and harmful to the architectural composition of the original building and to the street scene and the character of the area contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD, and the Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD.",
    "The proposed rear dormer window, by reason of its scale, bulk, mass and in conjunction with its render finish height, position and bulk would appear out of scale and character with the dwelling and materially harmful to the visual amenity of the surrounding area contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD, and the Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD.",
    "The proposed development, in particular the recessed/inset balcony would, by reason of its position and proximity to neighbouring properties would cause overlooking and loss of privacy which would have a serious and adverse effect on the living conditions of adjacent occupiers, contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, it was necessary to issue a decision as close to the statutory timeframe as possible as opposed to seeking amendments which would have significantly delayed the application."
