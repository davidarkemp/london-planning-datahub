    "The proposed rear dormer by reason of its scale, bulk and mass would not appear suitably subservient to the scale of the existing dwelling and it would appear as a dominant and bulky feature in the immediate area and the rear garden scene. The scheme would be visually prominent and detrimental to the open nature and character of this part of the Metropolitan Green Belt with no 'Very special circumstances' to justify the proposed extension, would therefore be contrary to Policy 26 of the Havering Local Plan, Policy G2 of the London Plan, the Council's Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document and Chapter 13 of the NPPF.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, it was necessary to issue a decision as close to the statutory timeframe as possible as opposed to seeking amendments which would have significantly delayed the application."
