    "It is considered that the proposed two storey side extension and the part 1/part 2 storey rear extensions would, by virtue of its excessive width and depth, scale and mass, lack subservience to the existing dwelling and would appear incongruous, dominant and visually intrusive in the rear garden environment and street scene contrary to policy DC61 of the London Borough of Havering Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD Adopted 2008, and the Adopted Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD 2011.",
    "The proposed first floor element of the two storey rear extension would, by reason of its excessive depth be unneighbourly development as well as having an adverse effect on the amenities of adjacent occupiers at no. 146 Southend Arterial Road contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it will be given to Mr Ivar Selter on 16-05-19."
