  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed development would, by reason of its height, bulk and mass, appear as an unacceptably dominant and visually intrusive feature in the streetscene harmful to the appearance of the surrounding area contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD.",
    "The proposed density of the development in relation to its site represents overdevelopment of the site which results in a development that appears cramped and out of character with its context, in exceedance of the recommended densities of the London Plan and the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD.",
    "The proposed development fails to present an affordable housing scheme as is required for development proposals of 10 dwellings or more, in conflicts with the requirements of the London Plan and the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD.",
    "In the absence of a legal agreement to prevent future occupants from applying for or obtaining a residents parking permit, the proposal fails to satisfactorily mitigate the parking impacts of the development, contrary to the provisions of Policies DC2 and DC33 of the Development Control Policies DPD.",
    "The proposed development would, by reason of its scale, design and siting close to its boundaries appear visually intrusive and unneighbourly, resulting in adverse outlook impacts and loss of privacy to surrounding residential dwellings, and compromise development potential of the adjoining car park site due to its scale and positioning of openings, which would have a serious and adverse effect on the living conditions of adjacent occupiers, contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD.",
    "The proposal fails to demonstrate that there is sufficient space on site to accommodate waste and cycle storage which is a critical consideration given the scale of the proposed development. Due to the lack of information the proposal fails to demonstrate compliance with the requirements of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD.",
    "A development proposal of this scale warrants the submission of a 3D Model and Computer Generated Images to demonstrate how the proposal sits in its context and its relationship to the local area. In addition, floor plans and site plans of the entire building should be submitted to demonstrate the relationship between residential units on the upperf floors and the existing ground floor commercial use.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to the agent via email on 2/6/20.",
    "The proposal, if granted planning permission on appeal, would be liable for the Mayor of London Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). Based upon the information supplied with the application, the CIL payable would be Â£91,200. Further details with regard to CIL are available from the Council's website."
