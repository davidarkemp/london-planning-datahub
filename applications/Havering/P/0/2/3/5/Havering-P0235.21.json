  "description": "Hip to gable loft conversion with 1 x rear dormer and 2 x front roof lights",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed development by reason of its gable roof form will visually unbalance the appearance of this semi-detached pair of properties. The proposals will therefore appear as an unacceptably dominant and visually intrusive form of development, causing harm to the streetscene, contrary to the Residential Extensions and Alteration Supplementary Planning Document and Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document.",
    "The proposed rear dormer window, by reason of its width, bulk and massing would occupy an unacceptably large area of the rear roof slope, forming a dominant and visually intrusive feature, detrimental to the character and appearance of the property and materially harmful to the visual amenity of the surrounding area, contrary to the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document and Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Plan Document.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, it was necessary to issue a decision as close to the statutory timeframe as possible as opposed to seeking amendments which would have significantly delayed the application."
