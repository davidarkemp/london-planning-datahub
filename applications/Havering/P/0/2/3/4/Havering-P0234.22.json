    "The proposed dwelling would fail to provide the required minimum gross internal floor areas and would therefore result in the provision of substandard of accommodation for future occupiers contrary to Local Plan Policy 7 and London Plan Policy D6.",
    "The proposal, if granted planning permission on appeal, would be liable for a Mayoral and Havering Community Infrastructure Levy payment as it would create one additional residential unit and would add a net additional 45sqm of residential floor space.  Therefore the proposal would incur a charge of £1,125 and £5,626 based on the calculation of £25 per square metre and £125 per square metre, subject to indexation.",
