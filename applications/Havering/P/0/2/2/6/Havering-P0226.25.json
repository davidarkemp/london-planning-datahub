    "The proposal would, by reason of its height, bulk and proximity to the nearby property at no.2b Hartland Road, be an intrusive, overbearing and unneighbourly development that would have a significant adverse effect on the amenities of these adjacent occupiers resulting in an increased sense of enclosure with an overbearing impact contrary to Policy 7 of the Havering Local Plan and the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document.",
    "The proposal would, by reason of its height and bulk, would form an incongruous feature in the street-scene and fail to take into account the character of the street and garden scene generally, and it would present as visually cramped within the site and prominent in the street scene.  The proposals would therefore be contrary to Policies 10, 7 and 26 of the Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 and also the NPPF which requires fundamentally that development add to the overall quality of the area whilst also establishing or maintaining a strong sense of place.",
    "There would be a inadequate outlook from the habitable rooms due to the proximity to the site boundaries. It is considered that the proposed development would result in a poor quality living environment for future occupiers, resulting in substandard residential accommodation to the detriment of the amenity of future occupants of this proposed dwelling.  The proposals would therefore be contrary to Policies 10, 7 and 26 of the Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 and Policy D6 of the London Plan.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, it was necessary to issue a decision as close to the statutory timeframe as possible as opposed to seeking amendments which would have significantly delayed the application.",
    "In the event that this application is allowed through the appeals process the proposals would be liable for the following CIL contributions:",
    "Mayoral CIL contribution of £1020 (x £25 per sqm).",
    "Havering CIL contribution of £5100 (x £125 per sqm)",
    "Each contribution would be subject to indexation."
