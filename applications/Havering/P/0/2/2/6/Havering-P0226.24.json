    "The development hereby permitted shall not be carried out otherwise than in complete accordance with the approved plans (as set out on page one of this decision notice).",
    "Reason:-",
    "For the avoidance of doubt and to ensure that the development is carried out as approved.",
    "Notwithstanding the provisions of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015, the premises shall only be used for the purposes specified in the application and for no other purpose.",
    "Reason:-",
    "This use only is permitted and other uses, either within the same Use Class, or permitted by the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 are not acceptable to the Local Planning Authority in this location.",
    "No work shall be carried out on the site between the hours of 22:00pm and 08:00am Mondays to Fridays, between the hours of 17:00pm and 8:00am on Saturdays, nor at any time on Sundays, Bank or Public Holidays.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To minimise the impact of the development on the surrounding area in the interests of amenity.",
    "Before the building hereby permitted is first occupied provision shall be made within the site for one disabled car parking space in accordance with the application and plans submitted to the Local Planning Authority. Thereafter this provision shall be made permanently available for use, unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To ensure adequate on-site parking is available for the disabled",
    "Prior to the first occupation of the development hereby approved, the disabled parking space shall be provided with active vehicle charging facilities for electric or Ultra-Low Emission vehicles.",
    "Reason:  Provision prior to first occupation of the proposed dwellings hereby permitted will ensure that the development adequately incorporates measures to allow the use of electric vehicles by future occupiers in accordance with Policy T6.1 of the London Plan."
