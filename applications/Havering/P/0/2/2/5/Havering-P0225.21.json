  "description": "Erection of 2 x 3 bedroom dwellings following the demolition of existing bungalow",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "As three bedroom dwellings as described, the proposed dwellings would fail to align with minimum standards required by London Plan 2021 Policy D6. As such the development would fail to provide acceptable living conditions for existing or future occupiers, contrary to LP Policy D6 and Policy DC61 of the Havering Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document (2008) (DPD). These require development to be of high-quality design that meet minimum standards and complement or improve the amenity of the area through its layout. It would further conflict with the guidance at paragraph 127 the Framework which seeks to ensure a high standard of amenity for existing and future users",
    "The proposed development makes provision for one space per dwelling which would fail to align with LDF Policy DC33 and London Plan 2021 Policy T6.1. In view of the deficit of off-street provision there is likely to be a material additional demand for the limited on-street parking, leading to increased parking stress, congestion and obstruction.  The proposal would therefore not comply with the aims and objectives of Policies DC26 and DC33 of the LDF Development Plan Document Development Control Policies and would be to the detriment of the amenity of existing and future residents, therefore contrary to Policy DC61. Furthermore the layout of the site to the front and arrangement of parking would conflict with Policy D5 (Inclusive design) of the London Plan 2021",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to the agent in writing 09-04-2021."
