    "The proposed development would be contrary to the general pattern of the development which primarily is characterised by row of houses to the front with generous landscaped gardens to the rear. The proposal would squeeze two dwellings at the far end of the garden, with poor access, taking up a significant portion of landscaped gardens and site on the boundaries with two neighbours. The proposed development due to its siting, scale, height, width and depth, the proposed dwelling would have a large bulk and massing, adjoining or close to common boundaries with neighbouring properties. The proposal would cause  unacceptably harm the character and appearance of the area. The proposed development therefore conflicts with Policies 7, 10, 26 and 27 of the Local Plan and Policy D3 of the London Plan, 2021. Taken together, these policies and guidance seek to ensure that development is of a high quality design and respects the distinctive qualities, identity, and character of the area and seeks",
    "The proposed development would, by reason of its layout, location proximity to neighbouring properties as well as the host building would create a cramped form of development and by reason of its design, scale, bulk, location, and prominent position would appear as overbearing thereby have an adverse impact upon the outlook and the amenities of adjoining occupiers in particular with reference with existing occupiers of the host dwellings. In these regards the proposal would be contrary to policies, 7 and 10 of the Local Plan, policy D6 of London Plan 2021.",
    "The proposed development would, by reason of failing to comply with the residential standard in terms of poor outlook, single aspect, poor daylight, inadequate internal height, poor access and inadequate provision for cycle, recycle and bin-storage, is considered that the scheme would provide significantly poor quality of accommodation for the future occupiers of the site contrary to Local Plan Policies 7, 10 and 27 and  policy D6 of London Plan 2021 and advice given in the NPPF.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to STATE WHO, HOW (EMAIL/PHONE/MEETING) AND WHEN.",
    "Please be advised that approval of this application from 1st September 2019 (either by London Borough of Havering, or subsequently by PINS if allowed on appeal following a refusal by London Borough of Havering) will attract a liability payment of £24,600 plus indexation in Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This charge has been levied under s.206 of the Planning Act 2008 and includes both the Mayor of London's CIL and Havering Council's CIL.",
    "London Borough of Havering, as CIL collecting authority, has responsibility for the collection of the Mayoral CIL, in addition to Havering's CIL, on commencement of the development.",
    "Your proposal is subject to a CIL Liability Notice indicating a levy of £.24,600 plus indexation for the application, based on the Mayoral CIL levy rate for Havering of £25/sq.m plus Havering's charging rate for residential of £125/sq.m  and the floorspace of 164 square metres.",
