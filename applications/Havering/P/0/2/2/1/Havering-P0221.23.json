    "The proposed development would, by reason of its lack of set back at first floor level, would not be subservient to the host dwelling and would alter the basic shape of the roof on the semi-detached house which is unacceptable as it would lead to an imbalance between the pair and create a visually heavy roof to one half causing a negative effect on the street scene by the loss of symmetry. Accordingly the proposal is of a poor quality design which is contrary to the purposes and intent of Local Plan Policy 7 and the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document.",
    "The proposed development would, by reason of its width and proximity close to the boundary of no. 31 Warren Drive, appear as an unacceptably dominant and visually intrusive feature in the streetscene, closing down the characteristic gap between properties, harmful to the appearance of the surrounding area contrary to Local Plan Policy 7 and the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document.",
