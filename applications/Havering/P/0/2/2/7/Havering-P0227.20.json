    "The proposed development would result in living conditions that do not create a suitably high quality living environment for future occupiers. The constraints and cramped layout of the proposed dwellings will be to the detriment of the amenity of future occupiers. The proposed dwellings fail to meet the minimum requirements of the Nationally Described Space Standards and fail to provide adequate private amenity spaces for both flats. The privacy of the ground floor residents will be compromised by the siting of the proposed communal bin and bicycle storage. The quality of the living conditions would be substandard and give rise to an overwhelming sense of enclosure in direct contrast to the aims of London Plan Policy 3.5 and Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD.",
