    "The layout of the development is inadequate resulting in substandard accommodation for future residents through lack of internal space. As a result, the development represents an overdevelopment of the site contrary to Policies DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD, the Technical Housing Standards, the Housing Standards Minor Alterations to the London Plan, Policy D6 of the London Plan and the Housing SPG 2016.",
    "The development, by reason of a lack of an outdoor amenity area, is harmful to the amenity of occupiers of the flats contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD and the Design for Living Supplementary Planning Document.",
    "The parking for the development is, by reason of the likely noise, general disturbance, light pollution and fumes associated with vehicles manoeuvring directly adjacent to the bedroom window of the ground floor flat, be detrimental to the amenity enjoyed by the occupier.  The development is therefore contrary to the Residential Extension and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document and Policy DC61 of the Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document.",
    "The development is, by reason of its the proximity of the corridor to the flank windows of the studio flat cause perceived inter-looking and loss of privacy which would have a serious and adverse effect on the living conditions of adjacent occupiers, contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD and  Residential Extension and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document .",
    "The development is, by reason of the inadequate depth and manoeuvring space available, be likely to result in vehicles overhanging the footway to the detriment of highway safety and pedestrian movement contrary to the aims and objectives of the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document and Policy DC32 and Policy DC33 of the LDF Development Control Policies Development Plan Document.",

This charge has been levied under s.206 of the Planning Act 2008 and includes both the Mayor of London's CIL and Havering Council's CIL.",
    "London Borough of Havering, as CIL collecting authority, has responsibility for the collection of the Mayoral CIL, in addition to Havering's CIL, on commencement of the development.",
