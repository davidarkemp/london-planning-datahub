    "The proposed extension by reason of its excessive scale, bulk, mass, and cramped appearance would unacceptably unbalance the appearance of these properties appearing as a dominant and visually intrusive feature in the rear environment. It would also unacceptably compromise the architectural composition of the building, in particular the proposed two storey rear extension would dominate the existing two storey outrigger to the rear which form the main feature in the rear elevation contrary to Policy DC61 of the London Borough of Havering's LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document 2008, the London Borough of Havering's  Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document 2011, and Policy 7.4 of the London Plan 2016.",
    "The proposed development would, by reason of its depth, height and position close to the boundary of the site, be an intrusive and unneighbourly development as well as having an adverse effect on the amenities of adjacent occupiers at Nos 109 and 113 Church Road, Romford contrary to Policy DC61 of the London Borough of Havering's LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document 2008, the London Borough of Havering's  Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document 2011, and Policy 7.4 of the London Plan 2016.",
