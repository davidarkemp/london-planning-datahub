  "decision_conditions": [
    "The use of the site for car storage associated with the car sales unit at 69-71 Butts Green Road would not contribute to the vitality, viability, character or function of this Minor Local Centre in Hornchurch. Furthermore, it would be harmful to the centre by way of loss of car parking for the existing uses on the site. The use would, by reason of the loss of car parking and inadequate on site car parking provision for the existing uses on the site, result in unacceptable overspill onto the adjoining roads to the detriment of highway safety and residential amenity and contrary to Policies DC33 and DC16 of Havering's Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document (adopted 2008) and Policy T6.2 of the London Plan (adopted 2021).",
    "The information submitted with the application does not include a detailed noise assessment or full details of activities associated with the storage use. In the absence of further information and having regard to representations received, the use of the site for car storage associated with the car sales unit at 69-71 Butts Green Road is considered to give rise to conditions which are harmful to the amenity of occupiers of neighbouring property, particularly by way of noise and disturbance arising from the frequency of movement of vehicles and the maintenance and vehicle preparation activities taking place within the site, contrary to the provisions of Policy DC61 of  Havering's Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document (adopted 2008)",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to Miss Alicia Lai (agent) via email on 20 April 2021."
