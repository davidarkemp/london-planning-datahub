  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed two storey front extension including the front canopy would by reason of its excessive depth and width appear as an unduly obtrusive and prominent feature in the street scene disrupting the relatively harmonious appearance and causing harm to its character.  The development is therefore contrary to the Supplementary Design Guidance (Residential Extensions and Alterations) and Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to Mr Constable by e-mail on 09/04/18."
