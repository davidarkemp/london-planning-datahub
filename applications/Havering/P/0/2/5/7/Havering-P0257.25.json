    "The proposed change of use, based on the level of details submitted with the application, its lack of type, scale, nature and operational management,  without which the proposals would be considered to result in an unsatisfactory use by way of noise, disturbance and inadequate facilities, which would be to the detriment of the amenity of the existing neighbouring properties, future occupiers,  and the continued operation of neighbouring occupiers. The proposed development is therefore contrary to Policy 17 of the Local Plan 2021, policy S3 of the London Plan 2021 and the NPPF 2024.",
    "The proposed change of use would, by reason of the lack of disabled car parking space and cycle spaces fails to provide inclusive and sustainable form of transport for the proposed users of the facility, and is therefore contrary to Policies 7, 24 and 35 of the Local Plan and Policies T5 and T6 of the London Plan 2021.",
