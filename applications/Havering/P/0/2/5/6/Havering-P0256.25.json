    "The proposed rear extension would, by reason of its scale, excessive depth and proximity to the neighbouring property no.65 Rainham Road, be an intrusive, overbearing and unneighbourly development that would have a significant adverse effect on the amenities of the adjacent occupiers resulting in an overbearing impact, an increased sense of enclosure and loss of outlook in relation to their main habitable room window and rear patio contrary to Policy 7 of the Havering Local Plan and the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, it was necessary to issue a decision as close to the statutory timeframe as possible as opposed to seeking amendments which would have significantly delayed the application."
