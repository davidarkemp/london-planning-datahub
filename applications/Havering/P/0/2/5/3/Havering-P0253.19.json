    "The proposed triple cart lodge garage, by reason of its scale, bulk and mass, would appear as an unacceptably dominant and visually intrusive feature harmful to the appearance of the surrounding area contrary the National Planning Policy Framework and Policies DC45 and DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document.",
    "The proposed triple cart lodge garage and additional hard standing would by reason of its scale, bulk, height and mass combined with the amount of development on the site, be detrimental to the rural character of the site, and  cause material harm to, the openness of the Green Belt and accordingly represents inappropriate development within the Green Belt . In the absence of very special circumstances that clearly outweigh the harm identified to the Green Belt, by reason of inappropriateness and other harm, the proposal is considered to be contrary to the guidance contained in the National Planning Policy Framework and Policies DC45 and DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document.",
