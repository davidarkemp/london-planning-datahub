    "The proposed rear dormer and first floor rear extension would by virtue of it's excessive protrusion, scale and mass lack subservience to the existing dwelling and would appear incongruous, dominant and visually intrusive in the rear garden environment and street scene contrary to policies 7.4 and 7.6 of The London Plan (2016), policy DC61 of the London Borough of Havering LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD 2008, and the London Borough of Havering Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD 2011.",
    "The proposed development of the hip to gable loft conversion would, by reason of its height, bulk and mass, result in an unbalancing of the semi-detached pair and appear as an unacceptably dominant and visually intrusive feature in the streetscene harmful to the appearance of the surrounding area contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD.",
    "The proposed development would, by reason of its proposed side window at the first floor level cause overlooking and loss of privacy to the attached neighbour at Nos. 3 and 3A Cedar Road, which would have a serious and adverse effect on the living conditions of adjacent occupiers, contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD.",
