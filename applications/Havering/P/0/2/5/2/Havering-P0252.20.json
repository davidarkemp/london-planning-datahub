    "The proposed replacement windows, by reason of their prominent location, inadequate materiality and detailed design, would materially and unacceptably detract from the character and appearance of the application premises, to the detriment of the street-scene. The proposal would neither preserve, nor enhance the special character of the Gidea Park Conservation Area and is therefore contrary to Policies DC61 and DC68 of the Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document and the NPPF.",
