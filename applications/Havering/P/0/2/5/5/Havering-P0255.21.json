  "description": "Conversion of a 3-bed flat to 2 x 1-bed flats involving a first floor rear extension and loft conversion to include a rear dormer and 2 front roof lights",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed first floor rear extension would, by reason of the excessive depth and proximity to the side boundary with the neighbour at no. 22A Elm Parade Flats, result in significant amenity impacts regarding a loss of access to sunlight/daylight for the sole window to a habitable room (kitchen) and a sense of enclosure and outlook, which is deemed unneighbourly and contrary to the Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD 2011 and Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD 2008.",
    "The proposed use of the roof top terrace as a communal outdoor amenity area for both proposed flats, would sit outside the sole window/door to the bedroom for Flat no. 1 and result in a loss of privacy and therefore low quality living environment for future occupants, contrary to DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD and the London Plan.",
    "The proposal, if granted planning permission on appeal, would be liable for the Mayor of London Community  Infrastructure Levy (CIL) which would incur a charge of £2366.25 based on the calculation of £25.00 per square metre. It would be liable for Havering CIL which would incur a charge of £11,831.25, based on the calculation of £125 per sqm of new floor space.",
    "A total of £14,197.50 is payable for CIL, if the application were to be approved through the appeal process. CIL amounts are subject to indexation.",
    "Further details with regard to CIL are available from the Council's website.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to the agent prior to the decision notice being issued."
