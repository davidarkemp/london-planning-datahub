    "The provision of rear dormer window of the design and proportions shown would be visually dominant and harmful to the character and appearance of the subject dwelling and wider conservation area setting. As such the development would fail to preserve the character or appearance of the Gidea Park Conservation Area. The development would conflict with policies DC61, DC64 and DC68 of the LDF and the objectives of the NPPF. The development also fails to preserve or enhance the character and appearance of Gidea Park Conservation Area, therefore contrary to Section 72(1) of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990.",
