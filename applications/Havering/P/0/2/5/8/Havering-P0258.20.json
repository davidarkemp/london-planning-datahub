  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposal is an incongruous form of development within the rear garden environment, out of character with the surrounding environment and established pattern of development, therefore harmful to local character and detrimental to neighbouring residential amenity, contrary to Policy DC61 of the London Borough of Havering LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD 2008.",
    "The proposed development would result in living conditions that do not create a suitably high quality living environment for future occupiers. The constraints of the site in conjunction with the design approach adopted would be to the detriment of the amenity of future occupiers. The constrained plot and arrangement of living accommodation including shortage of quality amenity space, lack of internal space, and single aspect arrangement and poor outlook, would be substandard and give rise to an overwhelming sense of enclosure and poor outlook, in direct contrast to the aims of London Plan Policy 3.5, the nationally described space standard and Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to the agent in email on 25/5/20.",
    "The proposal, if granted planning permission on appeal, would be liable for the Mayor of London Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and Havering CIL. Based upon the information supplied with the application, the CIL payable would be £950 and £5,700. Further details with regard to CIL are available from the Council's website."
