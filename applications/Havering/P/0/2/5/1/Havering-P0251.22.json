The revisions involved providing a gap of 2m from No.83, however, this brought the proposal closer to No.87 Kempton Avenue. Neighbours were re-consulted. Further, revisions were provided showing the correct opening on the rear elevation. The amendments were subsequently submitted on 31-03-22, 26-04-22 & 27-04-22."
