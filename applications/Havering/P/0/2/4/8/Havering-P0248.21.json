    "The proposed rear dormer window would poorly relate to the existing dwelling, by reason of its design and excessive width. The proposal would therefore create an unacceptably dominant and visually intrusive feature in the rear garden environment harmful to the character and appearance of the host property and visual amenity of the surrounding area, contrary to the Supplementary Design Guidance (Residential Extensions and Alterations) and Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Plan Document.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, it was necessary to issue a decision as close to the statutory timeframe as possible as opposed to seeking amendments which would have significantly delayed the application."
