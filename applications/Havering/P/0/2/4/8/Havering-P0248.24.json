    "The dwelling would be out of character for the built form in this locality and adversely disrupt the established pattern of development.  The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policies 10, 7 and 26 of the Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 and also the NPPF which requires fundamentally that development add to the overall quality of the area whilst also establishing or maintaining a strong sense of place.",
    "The proposed development would result in a poor quality living environment for future occupiers. The design approach adopted would provide poor outlook from the second bedroom and the proximity to the railway line would create unacceptable noise levels resulting in substandard residential accommodation to the detriment of the amenity of future occupants of this proposed 1-bed dwelling.  The proposals would therefore be contrary to Policies 10, 7 and 26 of the Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 and Policy D6 of the London Plan.",
    "The proposed development by reason of the access to the new dwelling next to the houses and gardens at no.6 and no.7 Chestnut Close would result in an overbearing impact with unreasonable levels of activity and vehicular movement next to these houses and their rear gardens to the detriment of their amenity contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policies D3 and D4 of The London Plan (2021) and Policies 7, 10 and 26 of the Local Plan.",
    "The proposed development would, by reason of the access and on-site car parking provision for both the host and the the new dwelling, result in unacceptable overspill onto the adjoining roads to the detriment of highway safety and residential amenity and contrary Policies 23 & 24 of the Havering Local Plan 2016-2031.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, it was necessary to issue a decision as close to the statutory timeframe as possible as opposed to seeking amendments which would have significantly delayed the application.",
