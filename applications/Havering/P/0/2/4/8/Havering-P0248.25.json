    "The proposed additional storey on 16c exacerbated by only extending one dwelling in the terraced row, would, by reasons of its location, scale, mass and height, appear as an unacceptably dominant, overbearing, incongruous and visually intrusive feature on site, within the streetscene and the surrounding area, more generally be out of character with the prevailing pattern of development on site, in the surrounding area to the detriment of the visual amenity of the locality, and would be contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2024), Policy D3 of The London Plan (2021) and Policies 7 and 26 of the Havering Local Plan 2016-2031.",
    "The proposed scale, bulk and massing along the boundaries of nearby properties as well as position of windows overlooking neighbours,  would be an unneighbourly, dominant, overbearing and an oppressive development, which would adversely impact on the living conditions of adjacent occupiers especially nos. 15 to 17 Dunton Road and nos. 1 to 4 Haysoms Close, and surrounding area contrary to Policy 7 of the Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 and the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document.",
