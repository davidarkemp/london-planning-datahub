  "description": "Regrading of land using spoil from the adjacent Hornchurch Leisure Centre development with associated landscaping.",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The development to which this permission relates must be commenced not later than three years from the date of this permission.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To comply with the requirements of Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended by Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004).",
    "The development hereby permitted shall not be carried out otherwise than in complete accordance with the approved plans (as set out on page one of this decision notice).",
    "Reason:-",
    "For the avoidance of doubt and to ensure that the development is carried out as approved.",
    "Within 60 days of the date of this permission, a detailed landscape management plan that will set out the measures to be undertaken following the soil re-profiling and SuDS engineering in relation to the seeding and planting works and chosen species and their provenance, including the timing of initial works and the ongoing vegetation management (and any replacements) on a seasonal basis for a period of 5 years, shall be provided for approval by the Council in writing. The landscaping proposals should maximise the opportunities to benefit biodiversity, e.g. low-nutrient soil of adequate depth should be used within the areas where wildflowers are to be encouraged.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To ensure enhancement of biodiversity and help preserve the eco-system.",
    "All planting, seeding or turfing comprised in the approved details of landscaping shall be carried out in the first planting and seeding seasons following the occupation of the building(s), or the completion of the development, whichever is the sooner.  Any existing or new trees or shrubs which, within a period of 5 years from the completion of the development, die, are removed, or become seriously damaged or diseased, shall be replaced in the next planting season, with others of a similar size and species, unless the local authority agrees any variation in writing.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To ensure that the appearance of the development is satisfactory and to safeguard the amenities of the adjoining premises from overlooking and loss of privacy.",
    "No retained tree shall be cut down, uprooted, destroyed, pruned, cut or damaged in any way during the development phase and thereafter within 5 years from completion of development, other than in accordance with the approved plans and particulars.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To safeguard and enhance the character and amenity of the area",
    "No floodlighting or other forms of external lighting shall be installed unless it is in accordance with details which have previously been submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority. Such details shall follow the Institute of Lighting Engineers Guidance and include location, height, type and direction of light sources and intensity of illumination. Any lighting that is so installed shall not thereafter be altered without the prior consent in writing of the Local Planning Authority other than for routine maintenance which does not change its details.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To ensure that the proposed development does not have an adverse impact on neighbouring residential amenity.",
    "All operations in connection with site excavation or other external site works; works involving the use of plant or machinery; the delivery of materials; the removal of materials and spoil from the site, and the playing of amplified music shall only take place between the hours of 8.00am and 6.00pm Monday to Friday, and between 8.00am and 1.00pm on Saturdays and not at all on Sundays and Bank Holidays/Public Holidays.",
    "Reason: To protect residential amenity, and in order that the development accords with Policy DC55 of LBH's 'Development Plan Document' 2008.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35(2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management) Order 2015: No significant problems were identified during the consideration of the application, and therefore it has been determined in accordance with paragraph 38 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2018."
