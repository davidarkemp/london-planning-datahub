  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed development would, by reason of the excessive depth of the ground floor rear extension and its combined depth, height, bulk, design and close proximity to the common boundaries with neighbours, result in an overbearing development that would be incongruous in contrast with the surrounding character, harmful to the appearance of the surrounding area and would detrimentally impact the amenity of the adjoining neighbours, which is contrary to the Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD 2011 and Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to Barry Sampson (agent), via email on 7 April 2021."
