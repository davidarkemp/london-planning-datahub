    "The proposed two storey side extension would, by virtue of its excessive scale and massing to a semi-detached dwelling, lack subservience to the existing dwelling, unbalance the pair of semi-detached dwelling and create a terracing effect. As such the proposed development would be visually intrusive in the street scene and rear garden environment contrary to policy DC61 of the London Borough of Havering Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD Adopted 2008 and the Adopted Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD 2011.",
