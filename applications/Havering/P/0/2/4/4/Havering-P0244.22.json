    "In the absence of information to demonstrate otherwise, the proposed replacement windows would by reason of their detailed design and through the use of unsympathetic materials fail to respect the original design and window detailing of the host building and would result in the loss of original fabric of the building and would be harmful to the character and appearance of the host building and fail to conserve or enhance the surrounding Gidea Park Conservation Area. The proposals are contrary to Local Plan policies 26 and 28; London Plan (2021) policy HC1 and paragraph 202 of the NPPF (2021).",
    "The proposed rear extension, by reason of the detailed design of its fenestration which is considered excessive and unsympathetic and would be harmful to the character and appearance of the host building and fail to conserve or enhance the surrounding Gidea Park Conservation Area. The proposals are contrary to Local Plan policies 26 and 28; London Plan (2021) policy HC1 and paragraph 202 of the NPPF (2021).",
    "The proposed side outbuilding, by reason of its height and excessive depth within the plot, is considered to be an incongruous structure and would result in a visually dominant structure sited at a prominent corner plot which would be harmful to the character and appearance of the host building and fail to conserve or enhance the surrounding Gidea Park Conservation Area. The proposals are contrary to Local Plan policies 26 and 28; London Plan (2021) policy HC1 and paragraph 202 of the NPPF (2021).",
    "The proposed rear garage structure would introduce further built-form within the characterful rear garden setting and reduce the contribution of this prominent site to the suburban garden character of the conservation area. The rear garage structure would therefore be harmful to the character and appearance of the host building and fail to conserve or enhance the surrounding Gidea Park Conservation Area contrary to Local Plan policies 26 and 28; London Plan (2021) policy HC1 and paragraph 202 of the NPPF (2021).",
