    "The development hereby permitted shall not be carried out otherwise than in complete accordance with the approved plans (as set out on page one of this decision notice).",
    "Reason:-",

    "The use of the building hereby permitted shall be only for agricultural purposes. No change of use of the building permitted by any Act or Development Order (or similar statutory instrument) shall take place (whether subject to prior approval/notification or not). Should the agricultural use of the building permanently cease, unless planning permission is granted within 3 years of cessation of the use of the building for an alternate use, then the building and associated development shall be removed from the land, and the land must, so far as is practicable, be restored to its condition before the development took place, or to such condition as may have been agreed in writing between the Local Planning Authority and the developer.",
    "Reason: To ensure that the development complies with Policy DC45 the Development Control Policies Development Plan Document and the provisions of the National Planning Policy Framework.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35(2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management) Order 2015: No significant problems were identified during the consideration of the application, and therefore it has been determined in accordance with paragraph 38 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2018.",
    "Due to the COVID-19 pandemic and social distancing measures implemented, a site visit was not undertaken by the case officer. For the purposes of assessing the proposed development a combination of historic photographs, including those from the previous submission, street-view, relevant aerial photography and historic records including drawings were utilised."
