    "The use of the premises, by reason of the level of activity, comings and goings and vehicle movement to and from the site including receipt of stock vehicles, overspill parking into surrounding roads and consequent impacts in terms of increased congestion and demand for on-street parking and general increase in levels of noise and disuturbance, has given rise to material harm to the amenity of nearby residents, thereby conflicting with Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 Policies 13, 26 and 34 as well as the objectives of the Framework which at Para 135 requires development add to the overall quality of an area and provide a high standard of amenity for existing and future users.",
    "Para 115 of the NPPF states that development should only be prevented or refused on highways grounds if there would be an unacceptable impact on highway safety, or the residual cumulative Impacts on the road network would be severe.  The use of the premises has caused detriment to surrounding neighbouring amenity through increased competition for limited on-street parking bays. The absence of a parking stress survey and anecdotal evidence made in representations lends weight to this and consequently the scheme would be unacceptable when assessed against London Plan Policy T6 and HLP Policies 23 and 24.",
