    "The original dwelling has a gross internal floor space which fails to meet the standard of 120 square metres, thereby resulting in the unacceptable loss of a much needed larger family homes within the Borough, contrary to Policy 8(i) of the Havering Local Plan 2021.",
    "A first floor room has a gross internal area of 7.4 square metres, which fail to meet the gross internal floor space of 8.5 square metres for one occupier and would be harmful to the amenity of the occupiers of the HMO, failing to meet with the requirements of the East London HMO guidance and would therefore fail to provide an adequate living environment for all occupants, contrary to Policy 7 of the Local Plan 2021 and Policy D6 of the London Plan 2021 and the London Housing Design Guide 2023.",
    "The intensification of the site would generate high levels of activity and result in an unacceptable impact on neighbouring residential occupiers in terms of noise and general disturbance associated with the proposed HMO use contrary to Policies 7 and 8 of the Havering Local Plan 2021.",
    "it is considered that the proposed development would result in an increased parking congestion in surrounding streets, contrary to Policies 8 and 24 of the Havering Local Plan and the guidance contained in the National Planning Policy Framework.",
    "The hip to gable roof extension would appear as a dominant and intrusive feature to the detriment of the character and appearance of the host property and visual amenity of the locality contrary to Policies 7 and 26 of the Havering Local Plan and the Council's Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, it was necessary to issue a decision as close to the statutory timeframe as possible as opposed to seeking amendments which would have significantly delayed the application."
