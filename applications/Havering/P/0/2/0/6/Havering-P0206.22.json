All planting, seeding or turfing comprised within the scheme shall be carried out in the first planting season following completion of the development and any trees or plants which within a period of 5 years from completion of the development die, are removed or become seriously damaged or diseased shall be replaced in the next planting season with others of a similar size and species, unless otherwise agreed in writing by the local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:-",

Submission of this detail prior to the commencement of any development in the case of the change of use of the premises will protect the amenity of future occupiers of the flats. It will also ensure that the development accords with Local Plan Policy 7.",
    "Prior to the first occupation of the development, details shall be submitted to and agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority for the installation of Ultra-Low NOx boilers with maximum NOx Emissions less than 40 mg/kWh. Where any installations do not meet this emissions standard it should not be operated without the fitting of suitable NOx abatement equipment or technology as determined by a specialist to ensure comparable emissions.

    "The amendments were subsequently submitted by email on the 26/04/22 and the 13/05/22.",
    "This proposal would be liable for a Mayoral and Havering Community Infrastructure Levy payment as it would create six additional residential units and would add a net additional 355sqm of floor space.",
    "Therefore the proposal would incur a charge of £8,875 and £44,375 based on the calculation of £25 per square metre and £125 per square metre, subject to indexation.",
    "These charges are levied under s.206 of the Planning Act 2008.  CIL is payable within 60 days of commencement of development.

In respect of surface water it is recommended that the applicant should ensure that storm flows are attenuated or regulated into the receiving public network through on or off site storage.  When it is proposed to connect to a combined public sewer, the site drainage should be separate and combined at the final manhole nearest the boundary.  Connections are not permitted for the removal of Ground Water.  Where the developer proposes to discharge to a public sewer, prior approval from Thames Water Developer Services will be required.
