    "The proposed development would enclose the characteristic gap between semi-detached pairs, creating the potential for a terracing effect and thus would be detrimental to the character and appearance of the original dwelling as well as the visual amenity of the streetscape. As such, the proposal is contrary to Policy DC61 of the London Borough of Havering LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document 2008, the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document 2011 and Policy 7.4 of the London Plan 2016.",
