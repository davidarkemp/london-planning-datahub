    "The proposed two storey building would, by reason of its excessive height and position close to the boundaries of the site, be an intrusive and unneighbourly development as well as having an adverse effect on the amenities of adjacent occupiers contrary to Policies 7 and 26 of the Havering Local Plan and the guidance contained in the National Planning Policy Framework.",
    "The proposed development would, by reason of its position and proximity to neighbouring properties cause overlooking and loss of privacy which would have a serious and adverse effect on the living conditions of adjacent occupiers, contrary to Policies 7 and 26 of the Havering Local Plan and the guidance contained in the National Planning Policy Framework.",
    "Preparation for any further re-submission informative.",
    "1) The applicant is advised to engage with highways and the transport officers in respect to the crossover and the re-location of the lamp post. There has been no previous involvement with highways and transport officers prior to the submission of this application. The proposed vehicle crossover/dropped kerb will require the Area Operations Officer (AOO) for the area to be satisfied that it is compliant with the terms and conditions of the vehicle crossover application process.",
    "2)  Drawing number 2213_PL_01 Revision 0 refers to the property to the north of the site being No.1A Allen Road, which is not case, as this is actually No.1 Allen Road. No.1 seems to have superimposed on the rear of No.353 Upminster Road North shown on the this plan. The mislabelling of these properties should be revised, prior to re-submitting any further planning applications.",
