    "The proposed development would, by reason of its height, bulk, mass and design as well as proximity to site boundaries, appear as an unacceptably dominant and visually intrusive feature in the streetscene harmful to the appearance of the surrounding area contrary to Policy DC61 of the London Borough of Havering's LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD 2008.",
    "The proposed development would, by reason of the reduction of quality amenity space, result in a cramped over-development of the site to the detriment of future occupiers and the character of the surrounding area contrary to Policy DC61 of the London Borough of Havering's LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD 2008 and the London Borough of Havering's Residential Design SPD 2011.",
    "The proposal would, by reason of its site layout, result in an unsatisfactory relationship between the host property and neighbouring dwellings leading to an incompatible arrangement to the detriment of amenity and contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD.",
    "In the absence of a legal agreement to secure contributions towards the demand for school places arising from the development, the proposal fails to satisfactorily mitigate the infrastructure impact of the development, contrary to the provisions of Policies DC29 and DC72 of the London Borough of Havering's Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD 2008 and Policy 8.2 of the London Plan 2016.",
    "The proposal, if granted planning permission on appeal, would be liable for the Mayor of London Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). Based upon the information supplied with the application, the CIL payable would be Â£5,100. Further details with regard to CIL are available from the Council's website.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to Mr Stephenson via email on 08/04/2019."
