    "The proposed roof alterations would not be subservient to the roof of the property, would alter the basic shape of the roof on the semi-detached house which is unacceptable as it would lead to an imbalance between the pair and create a visually heavy roof to one half causing a negative effect on the street scene by the loss of symmetry. Accordingly the proposal is of a poor quality design which is contrary to the purposes and intent of Local Plan Policy 7 and the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document.",
    "The proposed rear dormer is considered to give rise to an intrusive and unneighbourly form of development through overlooking and loss of privacy, resulting in harm to the amenity of the occupiers of neighbouring property no. 53 Eversleigh Gardens, contrary to the provisions of Local Plan Policy 7 the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document.",
