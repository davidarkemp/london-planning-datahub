    "The proposed development would, by reason of its siting, scale, design and roof form, appears as an incongruous feature in the streetscene harmful to the appearance of the surrounding area and inconsistent with the prevailing character of the local area, contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD and the relevant polices of the London Plan and NPPF.",
    "The proposed development would result in living conditions that do not create a suitably high quality external living environment for future occupiers. The proposed development would, by reason of the inadequate provision of amenity space in terms of size, dimension and shape taking into account the proposed occupancy of the dwelling, result in a cramped over-development of the site to the detriment of future occupiers and the character of the surrounding area contrary to the Residential Design SPD and Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD.",
    "The proposed development would, by reason of its height and position close to the boundary of the site, be an intrusive and unneighbourly development adversely impacting outlook and access to light of the adjacent occupiers, contrary to Policy DC61 of the London Borough of Havering's LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document 2008.",
