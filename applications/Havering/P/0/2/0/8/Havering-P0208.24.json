    "The proposed development would, by reason of a combination of its site coverage, quantum of development, layout, scale, height and bulk, result in a cramped and incongruous form of development, be out of character with the prevailing pattern of development in the surrounding area,  gives rise to an unacceptable overdevelopment of the site, visually intrusive in the streetscene and harmful to the character and appearance of site and surrounding area and the amenity of future occupiers of the development contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policies D1, D3 and D4 of The London Plan (2021), London Plan Housing SPG and Policies 3, 7 and 26 of the Local Plan 2021.",
    "The proposed development would, by reason of its form, scale and siting, combined with its position close to the boundaries of the site, give rise to a cramped appearance, dominant, overbearing, unneighbourly and visually intrusive feature in the rear garden environment harmful to the amenity of the host properties and surrounding dwellings in terms of overbearing impact, loss of outlook and privacy/overlooking, contrary to Policies 7 and 26 of the Local Plan 2021 and Policy D6 of the London Plan and the London Housing design Guide 2023.",
    "The proposed development would, due to the constraints of the site in conjunction with the site coverage and the design approach result in habitable rooms immediately adjacent to the existing buildings to the south and eastern sides having inadequate outlook, as well as the development providing no communal amenity space, which would give rise to substandard levels of residential accommodation to the detriment of the amenity of the prospective occupiers, in direct contrast to the aims and objectives of London Plan Policy D6 and Policy 7 of the Local Plan 2021.",
    "The proposed development would, by reason of the lack of on-site disabled car parking provision, fails to satisfactorily design an accessible scheme to meet the need of the future occupiers of flat 1 (M4(3), and would be contrary to Policies D5, D7 and T6.1 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "The proposed development would, by reason of its design, layout and proximity to the boundaries, establish a built form which would restrict the future redevelopment of neighbouring plots and prejudice the comprehensive redevelopment of the adjoining sites. The development would therefore give rise to poor quality isolated and piecemeal development which would undermine the wider aspirations for the site and surrounding area contrary to Policy 26 of the Local Plan 2021.",
    "The proposed site access to emergency services in particular; delivery and servicing arrangements; inadequate servicing arrangements for the site as a whole, as well as creating a site access with conflict in entering and exiting the site which would be detrimental to safe operation of the site, the safety of other road users and pedestrians on the surrounding highways network contrary to London Plan Policies T1, T2, T3, T4, T5, T6 and  T7.",
    "The proposal, by reason of the lack of provision of family sized homes within the development, and the failure to robustly demonstrate justification for this lack of provision and departure from the Council's housing mix requirements, is contrary to the requirements of Policy 5 of the Havering Local Plan 2021.",
    "In the absence of a legal agreement to secure restriction on ability to obtain parking permits, be likely to give rise to unacceptable overspill onto the adjoining roads to the detriment of highway safety and residential amenity and contrary to T6.1 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "The Flood Risk Assessment without a satisfactory Sequential or Exemptions Test has failed to adequately address how the development would avoid flood risk to people and property in accordance with Policy 32 of the Havering Local Plan 2021.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to the applicant's agent on 05.06.2024",
    "Please be advised that approval of this application from 1st September 2019 (either by London Borough of Havering, or subsequently by PINS if allowed on appeal following a refusal by London Borough of Havering) will attract a liability payment.",
    "The proposal would have 587sq.m of new residential floor space. The proposal would incur a charge of £14,675 Mayoral CIL and £73,375 of Havering CIL based on the calculation of £25 per square metre and £125 per square metre, subject to indexation.",
