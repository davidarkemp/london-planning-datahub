    "The proposed development to facilitate the loft conversion including hip-to-gable roof extension with L-shape rear dormer in terms of its scale, massing, design and character would appear incongruous development to the existing host building, unbalance the appearance of this semi-detached pair and appear as an unacceptably dominant and visually intrusive feature in the street scene, rear gardens and the surrounding area. As such, the proposal is contrary to Policies 7 & 26 of the Havering Local Plan and the Council's Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD (2011)."
