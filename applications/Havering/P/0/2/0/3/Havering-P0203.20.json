  "description": "Replace garage and conservatory with single storey rear extension/part double storey extension and double storey side extension.",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed two storey side extension would enclose the characteristic gap between semi-detached pairs, creating the potential for a terracing effect and thus would be harmful to the character and appearance of the original dwelling as well as the visual amenity of the streetscape. In addition, the excessive width of the first floor rear extension would form a dominant and visually intrusive feature, out of proportion to the host property detrimental to the visual amenity of the host property and that of the surrounding area. As such, the proposal is contrary to Policy DC61 of the London Borough of Havering LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document 2008, the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document 2011 and Policy 7.4 of the London Plan 2016.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to KMDS Designs, via email on 21 April 2020."
