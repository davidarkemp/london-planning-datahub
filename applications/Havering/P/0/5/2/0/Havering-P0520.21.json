    "The development to which this permission relates must be commenced not later than three years from the date of this permission.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To comply with the requirements of Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended by Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004).",
    "The development hereby permitted shall not be carried out otherwise than in complete accordance with the approved plans (as set out on page one of this decision notice).",
    "Reason:-",
    "For the avoidance of doubt and to ensure that the development is carried out as approved.",
    "No further external car park lighting shall be installed until an external lighting scheme is submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To ensure suitable lighting is provided to create a safe and secure environment and to prevent adverse impacts, on wildlife, residential amenity, safety and energy conservation (policy DC56 of the LDF, Draft Local Plan policy 34 and London Plan policy D11).",
    "The existing trees along the north site boundary adjoining the rear of numbers 2 to 12 Upland Court Road and the four existing trees to be retained within the car park shall be retained and protected from construction impacts and site works during development stage.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To ensure the preserved trees on site will be adequately protected during construction (policy DC60 of the LDF, Draft Local Plan policy 27 and London Plan policy G7).",
    "All hard surfaces hereby approved as part of the development (including any sub-base) shall be made of porous materials or provision shall be made to direct run-off water from the hard surface to a permeable or porous area or surface within the curtilage of the application site.",
    "Reason:-",
    "In order to ensure no water run-off from the hard surface which would contribute to risk of flooding (policy DC51 of the LDF, Draft Local Plan policy 32 and London Plan policy SI 13).",
    "The 'School Travel Plan', approved under planning permission ref: P1694.18 for this site shall continue to be implemented in full and maintained for the lifetime of the development.",
    "Reason:-",
    "Ensuring that the applicant adheres to the Travel Plan, throughout the life of the development, will seek to ensure the development accords with policies CP10, DC32 and DC61 of the Development Control Policies Development Plan Document and policies T1 and T4 of the London Plan.",
    "Prior to use of the car park hereby permitted full details of the cycle storage shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority. The cycle storage shall be permanently retained thereafter.",
    "Reason:-",
    "Insufficient information has been supplied with the application to demonstrate what facilities will be available for cycle parking.  Submission of this detail prior to occupation in the case of new building works or prior to the use commencing in the case of changes of use is in the interests of providing a wide range of facilities for non-motor car residents and sustainability (London Plan policy T5).",
    "Changes to the public highway (including permanent or temporary access)",
    "- Planning approval does not constitute approval for changes to the public highway. Highway Authority approval will only be given after suitable details have been submitted considered and agreed. If new or amended access is required (whether temporary or permanent), there may be a requirement for the diversion or protection of third party utility plant or highway authority assets and it is recommended that early involvement with the relevant statutory undertaker takes place. The applicant must contact Engineering Services on 01708 433751 to discuss the scheme and commence the relevant highway approvals process. Please note that unauthorised work on the highway is an offence.",
    "Highway legislation",
    "- The developer (including their representatives and contractors) is advised that planning consent does not discharge the requirements of the New Roads and Street Works Act 1991 and the Traffic Management Act 2004. Formal",
    "INFORMATIVE",
    "In promoting the delivery of safer, stronger, sustainable places the Local Planning Authority fully supports the adoption of the principles and practices of the Secured by Design Award Scheme and Designing against Crime. Your attention is drawn to the free professional service provided by the Metropolitan Police Designing Out Crime Officers for North East London, whose can be contacted via DOCOMailbox.NE@met.police.uk or 0208 217 3813  . They are able to provide qualified advice on incorporating crime prevention measures into new developments."
