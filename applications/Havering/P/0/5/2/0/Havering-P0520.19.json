  "site_name": "Youngs Farm",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The development to which this permission relates must be commenced not later than three years from the date of this permission.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To comply with the requirements of Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended by Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004).",
    "The development hereby permitted shall not be carried out otherwise than in complete accordance with the approved plans (as set out on page one of this decision notice).",
    "Reason:-",
    "The Local Planning Authority consider it essential that the whole of the development is carried out and that no departure whatsoever is made from the details approved, since the development would not necessarily be acceptable if partly carried out or carried out differently in any degree from the details submitted.  Also, in order that the development accords with Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policy DC61.",
    "No deliveries shall be taken at or despatched from the site outside the hours of 09.00 to 18.00 on Monday to Fridays  and 09.00 to 14.00 hours on Saturdays, Sundays and Bank or Public Holidays unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To protect residential amenity, and in order that the development accords with the Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policy DC61.",
    "The farm shop and cafe shall not be used for the purposes hereby permitted other than between the hours of 07:00 and 16:30 on Mondays to Saturdays and 10:00 and 16:00 on Sundays, Bank or Public holidays without the prior consent in writing of the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To enable the Local Planning Authority to retain control in the interests of amenity, and in order that the development accords with Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policy DC61.",
    "Before the uses commences, suitable equipment to remove and/or disperse odours and odorous material should be fitted to the extract ventilation system in accordance with a scheme submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority in consultation with the London Borough of Havering Public Protection Service. The approved equipment shall be installed on site and certification provided by a competent engineer. Thereafter, the equipment shall be properly maintained and operated within design specifications during normal working hours.",
    "Reason:  Insufficient information has been supplied with the application in relation to suitable equipment to remove and/or disperse odours and odorous material from the extract ventilation system. Submission of details prior to the cafÃ¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿© use commencing will protect residential amenity.  It will also ensure that the development accords the Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policy DC61.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35(2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management) Order 2015: No significant problems were identified during the consideration of the application, and therefore it has been determined in accordance with paragraph 38 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2019.",
    "A fee is required when submitting details pursuant to the discharge of conditions.  In order to comply with the Town and Country Planning (Fees for Applications, Deemed Applications, Requests and Site Visits) (England) Regulations 2012, (as amended), a fee of £116 per request or £34 where the related permission was for extending or altering a dwellinghouse, is needed."
