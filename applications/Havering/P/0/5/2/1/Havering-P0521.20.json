    "The proposed outbuilding would, by reason of its excessive height, depth and proximity to the shared boundary with no.74 Coniston Avenue, appear as a dominant, incongruous and visually intrusive feature in the rear garden environment, harmful to the character and appearance of the surrounding area as well as having an overbearing impact on the enjoyment of the amenity of the rear garden of no.74 to the detriment of the amenity of the occupiers of that property, contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document, the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document 2011 and Policy 7.4 of the London Plan.",
    "The proposed rear extension would, by reason of its excessive depth, height and position on the common boundary with no.78 Coniston Avenue, be an intrusive and unneighbourly development that would have an overbearing impact and result in a significant loss of outlook and an increased sense of enclosure to nearby habitable rooms and the enjoyment of the immediate outdoor private amenity space at the rear of no.78, to the detriment of the occupiers amenity, contrary to the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document 2011 and Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD.",
