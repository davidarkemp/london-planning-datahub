    "The proposed ground and first floor part rear extension would not comply with Council design guidance and would accordingly form a visually dominant and overbearing feature and one which would be detrimental to outlook of adjoining occupants (property subject of P0960.22) and their amenity more generally. As such the development would be contrary to Havering Local Plan Policies 7 and 26 of the Havering Local Plan.",

    "The proposals would create an additional bedroom and would accordingly allow for greater levels of occupancy of the existing dwelling which is in use as a small HMO. Any uplift in occupancy would represent a material change of use to Sui Generis which has neither been sought, nor formed part of this current application."
