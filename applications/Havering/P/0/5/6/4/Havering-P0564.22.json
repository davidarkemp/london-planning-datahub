    "The proposed rear dormer windows of the donor and proposed dwellings would, by reason of their excessive width, scale, mass and siting, not be contained well within the roof space and the cumulative impact of their proximity to, and the design, scale, bulk and siting of the single and two storey rear projections, the roof form of the two storey rear projections and the creation of the basements to the donor properties and the lower ground floor of the proposed dwelling, appear incongruous, dominant, unduly bulky and visually intrusive in the rear garden environment harmful to the amenity of adjacent occupiers and would result in significant harm to the character and appearance of the area contrary to the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document and Policies 7 and 26 of the Havering Local Plan.",
    "In the absence of a swept path analysis, the creation, siting and proximity of the car parking space for No. 24 Brooklands Gardens to the boundaries of the site, would impede pedestrian access to this property and result in a cramped layout with inadequate access and egress arrangements harmful to highway and pedestrian safety and the amenity of the occupiers contrary to Policies 23 and 24 of the Havering Local Plan and Policy T4 of the London Plan.",
    "In the absence of a swept path analysis/tracking plans, the creation, siting and proximity of the car parking space for No. 26 Brooklands Gardens to the street tree, would result in inadequate access and egress arrangements that would be harmful to highway and pedestrian safety and require the removal of a street tree contrary to Policies 23 and 24 of the Havering Local Plan, Policy 2 of the London Borough of Havering Tree Strategy 2009-2019 and Policy T4 of the London Plan.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: In accordance with paragraph 38 of the National Planning Policy Framework, improvements required to make the proposal acceptable were negotiated with Mr & Mrs Youngs via email on 14th June 2022.  The revisions involved removing the basements of the donor properties and the lower ground floor of the proposed dwelling and either retaining the proposed single and two storey rear projections or the loft development for the donor and proposed dwellings to reduce the bulk and massing at the rear. Vehicle tracking plans were requested for the parking spaces for Plots 24 and 26 to show that they can manoeuvre within the site, and the latter parking area does not give pressure to remove the street tree. The applicant declined to make the suggested revisions.",
