    "The proposed partial two storey and single storey rear extension would, by reason of its scale, size and bulk would result in a development that would not appear subordinate to the dwelling house, resulting in unduly dominant form of development in the garden scene and unbalance the row of terraced properties, contrary to Policy 26 of the Havering Local Plan (adopted 2021) and the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document (2011).",
    "The proposed first floor rear extension would, by reason of its size, scale, bulk and position close to the shared boundaries, would lead to an overbearing form of development that would appear unduly dominant and visually intrusive to the adjoining occupiers at No.7 and No.11 Northwood Avenue. The development would detrimentally impact neighbouring amenity contrary to Policy 7 of the Havering Local Plan (adopted 2021) and the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document (2011).",
