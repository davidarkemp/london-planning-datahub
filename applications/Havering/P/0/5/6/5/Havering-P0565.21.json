    "The development to which this permission relates must be commenced not later than three years from the date of this permission.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To comply with the requirements of Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended by Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004).",
    "The development hereby permitted shall not be carried out otherwise than in complete accordance with the approved plans (as set out on page one of this decision notice).",
    "Reason:-",
    "For the avoidance of doubt and to ensure that the development is carried out as approved.",
    "All building operations in connection with the construction of external walls, roof, and foundations; site excavation or other external site works; works involving the use of plant or machinery; the erection of scaffolding; the delivery of materials; the removal of materials and spoil from the site, and the playing of amplified music shall only take place between the hours of 8.00am and 6.00pm Monday to Friday, and between 8.00am and 1.00pm on Saturdays and not at all on Sundays and Bank Holidays/Public Holidays.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To protect residential amenity, and in order that the development accords with the Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policy DC61.",
    "Before any works commence a scheme for any new plant or machinery shall be submitted to the local planning authority to achieve the following standard. Noise levels expressed as the equivalent continuous sound level LAeq (1 hour) when calculated at the boundary with the nearest noise sensitive premises shall not exceed LA90 -10dB and shall be maintained thereafter to the satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason: Insufficient information has been supplied with the application in relation to any new plant or machinery.  Submission of details prior to commencement will ensure that the plant or machinery is not harmful to residential amenity.  It will also ensure that the development accords the Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policy DC61.",
    "Before any development is commenced, a scheme for protecting the proposed dwelling from noise from road traffic and commercial businesses shall be submitted to and approved by the Local Planning Authority.  Any works which form part of the scheme shall be completed before any of the permitted dwellings is occupied.",
    "Reason:  Insufficient information has been supplied with the application to assess the impact of noise from road traffic and commercial businesses. Submission of this detail prior to the commencement of any development in the case of the change of use of the premises will protect the amenity of future occupiers of the flats. It will also ensure that the development accords the Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policy DC61.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35(2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management) Order 2015: No significant problems were identified during the consideration of the application, and therefore it has been determined in accordance with paragraph 38 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2018."
