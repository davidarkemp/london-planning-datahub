The submission fails to accurately demonstrate the details of trees proposed to be retained within the site and explain how they would be impacted by the proposed development in the current and future context of the site's use, contrary to Policies 10 and 27 of the Havering Local Plan.",
    "The proposed development, by reason of the poor quality access arrangements for future occupiers of the development as well as the lack of sufficient information to demonstrate that the development will provide adequate levels of amenity, including adequate provision of internal daylight to the properties and daylight to the property's rear amenity space, would not give rise to a suitably high quality living environment for future occupiers of the development, contrary to Policies 7 and 10 of the Havering Local Plan.",
