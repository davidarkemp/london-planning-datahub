    "The site is within the area identified as Metropolitan Green Belt. The Local Development Framework and Government Guidance as set out in the NPPF is that in order to achieve the purposes of the Metropolitan Green Belt it is essential to retain and protect the existing rural character of the area so allocated and that the new building will only be permitted outside the existing built up areas in the most exceptional circumstances. The proposed development cumulatively is inappropriate and by definition harmful to the open character of the Green Belt. No special circumstances have been submitted in this case and the proposal is therefore contrary to Policy DC45 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD and the provisions of the NPPF 2019.",
    "The development, comprising the change of use and various unauthorised structures has resulted in a visually intrusive form of development, which is detrimental to the open character of the Green Belt. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy DC45 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document, as well as the provisions of the National Planning Policy Framework 2019.",
