    "The proposal, by reason of its contrived design, in particular the uncharacteristic narrowness of the proposed dwelling and the extent of site coverage, would give rise to a cramped and visually intrusive form of development, which is materially out of keeping with the prevailing pattern of development in Woburn Avenue, giving rise to material harm to the character and visual amenity of the locality, contrary to the provisions of Policies 7 and 26 of the Havering Local Plan, as well as the provisions of the NPPF.",
    "The proposal, by reason of lack of outlook from the bedroom owing to the obscure glazed oriel window, as well as the cramped garden depth and limited outlook from the main ground floor habitable room windows, give rise to an oppressive and poor quality living environment for future occupiers of the proposed development, contrary to the provisions of Policies 7 and 26 of the Havering Local Plan, as well as the provisions of the NPPF.",
    "The proposal, by reason of the height, bulk and mass of the proposed development, as well as its proximity to the northern boundary of the site give rise to an unneighbourly, intrusive and overbearing form of development, giving rise to material harm to the amenity of adjoining occupiers, in particular 2D Woburn Avenue and 218 Elm Park Avenue, contrary to the provisions of Policies 7 and 26 of the Havering Local Plan, as well as the provisions of the NPPF.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given the substantial conflict with adopted planning policy it was decided to proceed to determine the application as submitted.",
    "The proposal, if granted planning permission on appeal, would be liable for the Mayor of London and Havering Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). Based upon the information supplied with the application, the Mayoral CIL payable would be £1815 based on the calculation of 72.6 sq.m.  at  £25.00 per square metre and the Havering Community Infrastructure Levy (HCIL) would be a charge of £9075 based on calculation of 72.6 sqm at £125 per square metre. Each would be subject to indexation.",
    "Further details with regard to CIL are available from the Council's website."
