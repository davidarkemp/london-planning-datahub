    "The proposed development falls within a flood risk vulnerability category that is inappropriate to the Flood Zone in which the application site is located. The Flood Risk Assessment is inadequate and does not comply with the requirements for site-specific flood risk assessments and therefore, does not adequately assess the flood risks posed by the development. The application involves works within 8 metres of a watercourse/flood defence and does not adequately assess the development's impact on proximity to natural bank. The proposed development would restrict essential maintenance and emergency access to the main river. Therefore, the proposal is contrary to Policy 32 of the Havering Local Plan, Policy SI 12 of the London Plan, the National Planning Policy Framework and the Planning Practice Guidance.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to Esen Loft via email on 19th June 2023.",
    "The proposal, if granted planning permission on appeal, would be liable for the Mayor of London Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). Based upon the information supplied with the application, the Mayoral CIL payable would be £4,525 based on the calculation of £25.00 per square metre. This would be subject to indexation.",
    "Further details with regard to CIL are available from the Council's website.",
    "The information on the application form and the CIL form should be checked in the event of a resubmission or appeal."
