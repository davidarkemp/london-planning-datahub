    "The roof area of the extension hereby permitted shall not be used as a balcony, roof garden or similar amenity area without the grant of further specific permission from the Local Planning Authority.",

    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: In accordance with paragraph 38 of the National Planning Policy Framework, improvements required to make the proposal acceptable were negotiated with Mrs Erk (Agent) by phone and e-mail. The revisions involved clarity in respect to the cross section as it did not match with the other drawings. The amendments were subsequently submitted on 07-06-22."
