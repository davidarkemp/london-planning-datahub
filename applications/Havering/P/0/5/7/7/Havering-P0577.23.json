Any modifications to the Noise Management Plan shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority.  The Noise Management Plan shall be adhered to at all times whilst the permitted use continues.",

The refuse and recycling facilities shall be permanently retained thereafter.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To protect the amenity of occupiers of the development and also the locality generally.",
    "The maximum number of residents occupying the premises hereby approved shall not exceed five at any one time disregarding staff.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To restrict the use of the premises to one compatible with the surrounding area and that the development accords with Policy 16 of the Havering Local Plan 2016-2031.",
    "Prior to the first occupation of the development hereby approved, one parking space shall be provided with active vehicle charging facilities for electric or Ultra-Low Emission vehicles.",
    "Reason:  Provision prior to first occupation of the property as a care home hereby permitted will ensure that the development adequately incorporates measures to allow the use of electric vehicles by future occupiers in accordance with Policy T6.1 of the London Plan.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35(2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management) Order 2015: No significant problems were identified during the consideration of the application, and therefore it has been determined in accordance with paragraph 38 of the National Planning Policy Framework.",
    "INFORMATIVE",
