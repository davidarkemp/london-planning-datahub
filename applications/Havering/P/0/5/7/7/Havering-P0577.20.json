    "The site is within the area identified as Metropolitan Green Belt. The Local Development Framework and Government Guidance as set out in the NPPF 2019 is that in order to achieve the purposes of the Metropolitan Green Belt it is essential to retain and protect the existing rural character of the area so allocated and that the development including change of use will only be permitted outside the existing built up areas in the most exceptional circumstances.  No special circumstances have been submitted in this case and the proposal is therefore contrary to Policy DC45 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD and the provisions of the NPPF.",
    "The indicative scale of  the proposed development would not respect the local character and would result in a visually intrusive form of development, which is detrimental to the open character of the Green Belt. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy DC45 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document, as well as the provisions of the National Planning Policy Framework 2019.",
    "It has not been demonstrated that the proposed site access would be adequate for refuse collection vehicles and emergency and rescue vehicles resulting in inadequate servicing arrangements contrary to Policy DC36 of the LDF Development Control Policies Development Plan Document.",
    "The submitted proposals are not sufficiently detailed in respect of the nature of the operation of the proposals, details of servicing arrangements, or impacts of the development on site drainage and ecology.  In the absence of such information, the Local Planning Authority cannot be certain that the of the impacts of the proposal in these respects but is concerned that there may be adverse environmental impacts arising from the development, which can not be properly assessed by this application.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reasons for it was given to the agent via email on 22/06/2020."
