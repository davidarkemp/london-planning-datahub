    "The proposed development would, by reason of its design, form, siting, and layout appear incongruous, cramped and out of character with the prevailing pattern of neighbouring development making it harmful to the character and appearance of the surrounding area and contrary to Policy DC61 and CP17 of the London Borough of Havering LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD 2008 and the National Planning Policy Framework 2019. Paragraph 124 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2019 states that the creation of high quality buildings and places is fundamental to what the planning and development process should achieve. Good design is a key aspect of sustainable development, creates better places in which to live and work and helps make development acceptable to communities. This proposal does not meet the design objectives of the National Planning Policy Framework 2019.",
    "The proposed development would, by reason of its form, scale and siting, appear overbearing, visually intrusive and be an unneighbourly development resulting in a loss of amenity to No. 4 Manor Road, including loss of outlook contrary to the implementation of Policy DC61 of the London Borough of Havering LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD 2008 and the National Planning Policy Framework 2019.",
    "In the absence of a legal agreement to secure contributions towards the demand for school places arising from the development, the proposal fails to satisfactorily mitigate the infrastructure impact of the development, contrary to the provisions of Policies DC29 and DC72 of the Development Control Policies DPD and Policy 8.2 of the London Plan.",
    "The proposal, if granted planning permission on appeal, would be liable for the Mayor of London Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). Based upon the information supplied with the application, the CIL payable would be Â£2,300. Further details with regard to CIL are available from the Council's website.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to Alan Short on the telephone and via email on 7th June 2019."
