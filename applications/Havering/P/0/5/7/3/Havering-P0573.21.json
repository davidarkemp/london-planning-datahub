    "The proposed two storey side extension would, by reason of its excessive height, depth, bulk and proximity to the boundary, be unneighbourly which would give rise to an uncomfortable and overbearing effect resulting in an increased sense of enclosure, loss of outlook, loss of sunlight and be harmful to neighbouring properties contrary to Policy DC61 of the London Borough of Havering LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD 2008, and the London Borough of Havering Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD 2011.",
