    "The two-storey side extension would, by reason of its gabled roof design and lack of set back from the existing front elevation, result in a dominant and visually intrusive extension, unbalancing the symmetery of this pair of semis as well as being detrimental to the character and appearance of the host property and visual amenity of the locality contrary to Policy 26 of the Havering Local Plan 2021.",
    "The proposed single storey rear extension would, by reason of its overall depth and height form a dominant and intrusive feature detrimental to the character and appearance of the host property as well as having an adverse impact on the amenity of the adjacent occupier at no.44, resulting in an overbearing impact and an increased sense of enclosure contrary to Policy 7 and 26 of the Havering Local Plan 2021.",
    "The proposed hip to gable roof alteration, extended roof over the side extension and rear dormer cumulatively would be visually intrusive and overly dominate the roof space of the dwelling, detrimental to the character and appearance of the host property and rear garden environment, contrary to Policy 7 and 26 of the Havering Local Plan 2021, the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document and Policy D1 of the London Plan 2021.",
