    "For the avoidance of doubt and to ensure that the development is carried out as approved.",
    "The use of the buildings 2 and 2A Walden Avenue shall be as a Large House in Multiple Occupation (HMO) as defined in the Housing Act (2004), and by Use Class 'Sui Generis' of the Town and Country Planning (Use Classes) Order 1987 (as amended), and shall not be occupied by more than nine persons at any time per dwelling.",
    "Reason:-",
    "In order to ensure that the use of the building and level of occupancy does not give rise to an unacceptable level of impact on adjoining residential occupiers or have an adverse impact on the character and appearance of the area in accordance with policies DC4, DC5 and DC61 of the Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD.",

    "Reason:-",
    "To ensure that car parking accommodation is made permanently available to the standards adopted by the Local Planning Authority in the interest of highway safety, and that the development accords with the Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policy DC33.",
    "Prior to first occupation details of the refuse and recycling facilities must be provided in accordance with details which shall previously have been submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority.

The revisions involved the omission of landscaping details to the front hard standing. The amendments were subsequently submitted on 24 June 2020.",
    "The applicant should note that this planning permission relates to the use of the building as a (sui generis) house of multiple occupation (HMO), providing communal living accommodation for nine persons.
