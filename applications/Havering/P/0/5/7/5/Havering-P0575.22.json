    "No adequate justification has been given to support the uplift in occupancy over and above that of the allocation given at Policy 11 of the Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 or the impacts of the development more broadly through the cumulative impact of additional structures and development in particular the resultant impact on character and landscape quality of the site. The ambiguity and appropriateness of any commercial function and close relationship lends weight to this. The proposals are therefore unacceptable in principle and contrary to Policies 11, 26 and 27 of the Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 and the objectives of the Framework.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to the agent in writing 06-10-2022.",
    "The proposal, if granted planning permission on appeal, would be liable for the Mayor of London and Havering Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). Based upon the information supplied with the application, the CIL payable would be:",
    "MCIL (25 per sqm) - £5,425",
    "HCIL (125 per sqm) - £27,125",
    "Each would be subject to indexation.",
    "Further details with regard to CIL are available from the Council's website.",
    "The applicant is advised that should a decision be taken to resubmit/or appeal this decision that consideration be given to clarifying the existing commercial function at the site through seeking a lawful development certificate if the use has existed for more than ten years. The applicant shall otherwise provide robust information about the nature of the commercial use with any forthcoming resubmission in order that it can be considered fully in decision making."
