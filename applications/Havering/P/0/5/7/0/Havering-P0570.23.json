    "The proposed outbuilding and associated hard-standing would through its siting, excessive footprint and overall height form a prominent and intrusive feature out of character with the surrounding environment, that would have a signficant adverse impact to the detriment of the openness of the Green Belt. The development would fail to align fully with any of the exceptions given within the NPPF and no Very Special Circumstance case has been made which overcomes the in principle and other harm identified. The development would also be contrary to Policy G2 of the London Plan.",
    "The proposed development would by reason of its scale, bulk and mass and lack of subservience appear as an unacceptably dominant and visually intrusive feature from the adjoining site and would form an unneighbourly feature. Further to this its use and arrangement of openings would be detrimental to the amenity of neighbouring occupiers through overlooking and loss of privacy. It would therefore be contrary to the objectives of the NPPF, specifically Para 130 which requires development add to the overall quality of the area, Policies 7 and 26 of the Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 and the Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD 2008.",
