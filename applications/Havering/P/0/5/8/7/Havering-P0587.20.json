    "The proposed extension of operating hours, without a noise impact assessment, would by reason of its location and relationship to nearby sensitive receptors, result in an unsatisfactory relationship by way of noise and general disturbance associated with the use, which would be to the detriment of the amenity and living conditions of neighbouring occupiers. The proposed development is therefore contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD.",
