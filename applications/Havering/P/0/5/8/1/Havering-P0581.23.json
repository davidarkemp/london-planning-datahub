    "The proposed dwelling would, by reason of its crown roof, design, scale, bulk, mass, depth, siting and position close to the boundaries of the site, appear unduly cramped, incongruous, dominant and visually intrusive and out of character with the prevailing pattern of development in the locality, harmful to the character and appearance of the surrounding area contrary to Policy 26 of the Havering Local Plan and Policy D4 of the London Plan.",
    "The proposed dwelling would, by reason of its excessive depth,  scale, bulk, mass, siting, and position close to the north western boundary of the site, appear a dominant, overbearing, unneighbourly and visually intrusive feature in the rear garden environment  and provide a \"wall of development\" which would give rise to an uncomfortable overbearing effect and sense of enclosure and result in a significant loss of amenity to No. 12 Pettits Lane, including loss of light and outlook contrary to Policies 7 and 26 of the Havering Local Plan and the guidance in the National Planning Policy Framework.",
    "The proposed dropped kerb would be harmful and cause damage to the roots of the two street trees to the front of the site contrary to Policy 2 of the London Borough of Havering Tree Strategy 2009-2019.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to Bhuler Design Ltd via email on 11th January 2024.",
    "For Residential Development Only",
    "Please be advised that approval of this application from 1st September 2019 (either by London Borough of Havering, or subsequently by PINS if allowed on appeal following a refusal by London Borough of Havering) will attract a liability payment of £146,100 plus indexation in Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This charge has been levied under s.206 of the Planning Act 2008 and includes both the Mayor of London's CIL and Havering Council's CIL.",
    "London Borough of Havering, as CIL collecting authority, has responsibility for the collection of the Mayoral CIL, in addition to Havering's CIL, on commencement of the development.",
    "Your proposal is subject to a CIL Liability Notice indicating a levy of £24,350 plus indexation for the application, based on the Mayoral CIL levy rate for Havering of £25/sq.m plus Havering's charging rate for residential of £125/sq.m (Zone A) and the floorspace of 974 square metres.",
