    "The proposed annexe, by virtue of its siting, massing, design, and close proximity to the common boundary with No.1 Dee Way would appear as an overbearing and overshadowing development which is visual intrusion. The proposed annexe would therefore be detrimental to the amenity that No.1 can reasonably expect to enjoy and is contrary to Policy 7 of the Havering Local Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy a decision was made on the application, which will enable the applicant to exercise a right of appeal if they so wish."
