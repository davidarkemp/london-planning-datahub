    "The proposal is unacceptable in principle, as it would result in the loss of offices and introduce a residential use at ground floor, which would be harmful to the vitality and viability of Rainham District Centre and the local character and appearance of the Rainham Conservation Area contrary to Policies 13 and 28 of the Havering Local Plan and Policies HC1 and SD6 of the London Plan.",
    "Flats 1 & 2, by reason of their layout, would result in substandard accommodation for future residents through limited outlook and light, contrary to Policy 7 of the Havering Local Plan and Policy D6 of the London Plan.",
    "The lack of amenity space for the proposed flats would be harmful to the amenity of future occupiers contrary to Policy 7 of the Havering Local Plan and Policy D6 of the London Plan.",
    "The proposal would, by reason of its excessive depth, height, scale, bulk, mass, twin gabled roof, form and position close to the boundaries of the site, lack subservience to the host and appear overbearing, unduly dominant and visually intrusive harmful to the form, architectural character and appearance of this locally listed building and fail to preserve or enhance the Rainham Conservation Area contrary to Policies 26 and 28 of the Havering Local Plan and Policies D3, D4 and HC1 of the London Plan and the guidance in the National Planning Policy Framework.",
    "The proposed development, due to a lack of on-site car parking provision would result in overspill on to surrounding streets detrimental to the surrounding highway network and amenity enjoyed by nearby residents, contrary to Policy 24 of the Havering Local Plan and Policies T6 and T6.1 of the London Plan.",
    "There is no defensible space adjacent to the bedroom windows of Flats 1 & 2, which face onto the refuse/recycling and cycle storage, which would be harmful to the amenity of future occupiers and in the absence of the servicing arrangements for the proposed flats, the proposed development is contrary to Policies 7, 24 and 35 of the Havering Local Plan and Policy T7 of the London Plan.",
    "In the absence of a desk-based archaeological assessment to identify the likely effects of the development on the significance of heritage assets, including considering the potential for new discoveries and effects on the setting of nearby assets, including further evaluation and/or mitigation measures, the proposal is contrary to Policy 28 of the Havering Local Plan, Policy HC1 of the London Plan and the guidance in the National Planning Policy Framework.",
    "In the absence of a flood risk assessment to demonstrate how the proposed development and the site users will be kept safe for the lifetime of the development without increasing risk elsewhere, the proposal is contrary to Policy 32 of the Havering Local Plan, Policy SI 12 of the London Plan 2021 and the guidance contained in the National Planning Policy Framework.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to Stephensons via email on 13th June 2023.",
    "For Residential Development Only",
    "Please be advised that approval of this application from 1st September 2019 (either by London Borough of Havering, or subsequently by PINS if allowed on appeal following a refusal by London Borough of Havering) will attract a liability payment of £33,900 plus indexation in Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This charge has been levied under s.206 of the Planning Act 2008 and includes both the Mayor of London's CIL and Havering Council's CIL.",
    "London Borough of Havering, as CIL collecting authority, has responsibility for the collection of the Mayoral CIL, in addition to Havering's CIL, on commencement of the development.",
    "Your proposal is subject to a CIL Liability Notice indicating a levy of £5,650 plus indexation for the application, based on the Mayoral CIL levy rate for Havering of £25/sq.m and the floorspace of 226 square metres.",
