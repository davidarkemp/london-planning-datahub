    "The proposed development would, by reason of its awkward design with the various roof profiles appear as an unacceptably incongruous, overbearing dominant feature which is visually intrusive to the street scene and rear garden environment detrimental to the character as well as appearance of the host property and visual amenity of the locality contrary to policies D3 and D4 of The London Plan (2021), policy DC61 of the London Borough of Havering LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD 2008, and the London Borough of Havering Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD 2011.",
    "The proposed two storey side extension would, by reason of its proximity to the shared boundary and the orientation of the host dwelling with more than half the depth projecting beyond the rear wall of No. 26 Stewart Avenue, be unneighbourly which would give rise to an uncomfortable and overbearing effect resulting in an increased sense of enclosure, visually oppressive and be harmful to the western neighbouring property, No. 26 Stewart Avenue, contrary to Policy DC61 of the London Borough of Havering LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD 2008, and the London Borough of Havering Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD 2011.",
