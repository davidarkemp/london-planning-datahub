    "The proposed development would, by reason of its layout, fail to provide adequately designed off-street parking, and has not adequately demonstrated that it would not through parking displacement have an unacceptable impact on on-street parking, as well as highway safety. The development would fail to integrate into the existing site and the area more generally, and is contrary to London Plan policies T4, T6, T6.1, Local Plan policies 23 and 24 and paragraph 111 of the NPPF (2021).",
    "The proposed development would by reason of its size, bulk, position and inappropriate design fail to integrate into the existing site and respect the character of the area more generally, and would be unacceptable when assessed against paragraphs 130 and 134 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policies D4, D6 and D8 of the London Plan (2021), and policy 26 of the Havering Local Plan (2021).",
    "The proposed development would, by reason of inappropriate design in an area that has road hazards, have an unacceptable impact on highway safety, and in the absence of pedestrian visibility splays would likely add to an existing hazardous road layout. The proposed development is therefore unacceptable and contrary to London Plan policies D6, D8, T4, T6, T6.1, Local Plan policies 23, 24 and 26 and paragraphs 111, 130 and 136 of the NPPF (2021).",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to the Agent by email on the 08/06/22.",
    "The proposal, if granted planning permission on appeal, would be liable for a Mayoral and Havering Community Infrastructure Levy payment as it would create one additional residential unit and would add a net additional 79sqm of residential floor space.  Therefore the proposal would incur a Havering CIL charge of £9,875 and a Mayoral CIL charge of £1,975 based on the calculation of £25 per square metre and £125 per square metre, subject to indexation.",
