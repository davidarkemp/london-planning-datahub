    "The proposed single storey rear extension would, by reason of its depth, height and position close to the shared boundaries, lead to a visually intrusive and overbearing form of development that would have an adverse effect on the amenity of the adjoining occupiers at No.28 and No.30 Retford Close, contrary to Policy 7 of the Havering Local Plan (adopted 2021) and the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document (2011).",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy a decision was made on the application, which will enable the applicant to exercise a right of appeal if they so wish."
