    "The proposals would provide substandard level of accommodation that would adversely impact on the living conditions of future occupiers with very poor private external amenity areas and outlook, creating significant sense of enclosure for future occupiers,  including the second floor north facing terrace providing very poor private external amenity area,  and would be contrary to Local Plan Policy 7 and London Plan Policies D6. The proposal would also fail to accord with the core principle set out in Paragraph 130 of the National Planning Policy Framework which seeks to ensure a high standard of amenity for existing and future occupants of land and buildings.",
    "The proposed site coverage, scale, bulk and massing along the boundaries of nearby properties would be an unneighbourly, dominant, overbearing and an oppressive development which would adversely impact on the visual amenity of adjacent occupiers, contrary to Local Plan Policy 7 and London Plan policies D3 and D4.",
    "Given the location of the site a car free scheme could be acceptable, however, there is no legal undertaking for future occupiers of the site to be excluded from applying for over-subscribed residential parking zone. In the absence of legal agreement to exempt the future occupiers of the site from residential parking zone as insufficient together with the lack of relevant information, it is considered that the proposal would have an adverse impact upon the free flow of traffic and the safety of highway condition, and woul be contrary to Policy 24 of the Local Plan 2021 and the London Plan Policy T6.1 of 2021.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, it was necessary to issue a decision as close to the statutory timeframe as possible as opposed to seeking amendments which would have significantly delayed the application.",
    "In the event that this application is allowed through the appeal process, the proposals would be liable for CIL contributions (MCIL & HCIL) totalling £29,250.00 subject to indexation.",
    "Further details with regard to CIL are available from the Council's website."
