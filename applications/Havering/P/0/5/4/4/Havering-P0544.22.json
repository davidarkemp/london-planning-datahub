    "The development to which this permission relates must be commenced not later than three years from the date of this permission.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To comply with the requirements of Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended by Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004).",
    "The development shall be carried out in accordance with the hard and soft landscaping details shown on drawing no. 22/BEDFORDS.01 Revision E and the information in the Revised Design and Access Statement Revision E  including the \"Landscape Schedule and Management Plan\". All planting, seeding or turfing comprised within the scheme shall be carried out in the first planting season following completion of the development and any trees or plants which within a period of 5 years from completion of the development die, are removed or become seriously damaged or diseased shall be replaced in the next planting season with others of a similar size and species, unless otherwise agreed in writing by the local Planning Authority. The existing tree screen shall be retained in place for the duration of the development remaining in place.",
    "Reason:- To ensure that the development achieves a satisfactory level of landscape quality in accordance with Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 Policies 27 and 30.",
    "No building shall be occupied or use commenced until refuse and recycling facilities are provided in accordance with details which shall previously have been submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority. The refuse and recycling facilities shall be permanently retained thereafter.",
    "Reason:-",
    "Insufficient information has been supplied with the application to judge how refuse and recycling will be managed on site.  Submission of this detail prior to occupation in the case of new building works or prior to the use commencing in the case of changes of use will protect the amenity of occupiers of the development and also the locality generally.",
    "All building operations in connection with the construction of external walls, roof, and foundations; site excavation or other external site works; works involving the use of plant or machinery; the erection of scaffolding; the delivery of materials; the removal of materials and spoil from the site, and the playing of amplified music shall only take place between the hours of 8.00am and 6.00pm Monday to Friday, and between 8.00am and 1.00pm on Saturdays and not at all on Sundays and Bank Holidays/Public Holidays.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To protect residential amenity.",
    "All hard surfaces hereby approved as part of the development (including any sub-base) shall be made of porous materials or provision shall be made to direct run-off water from the hard surface to a permeable or porous area or surface within the curtilage of the application site.",
    "Reason:-",
    "In order to ensure no water run-off from the hard surface which would contribute to risk of flooding.",
    "No commercial or business activities shall take place on the land, nor shall any equipment or paraphernalia associated with any business use be stored on the land.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To restrict the use of the site to one compatible with the surrounding area and to enable the Local Planning Authority to exercise control over any future intensification  use not forming part of this application.",
    "The site shall not be occupied by any persons other than Gypsies and Travellers, defined as persons of nomadic habit of life whatever their race or  origin, including such persons who on grounds only of their own or their family's or dependants' educational or health needs or old age have ceased to travel temporarily or permanently, but excluding members of an organised group of Travelling Showpeople or circus people travelling together as such.",
    "Reason:-",
    "In accordance with Policy 11 of the Havering Local Plan and the identified need identified.",
    "No vehicle exceeding 3.5 tonnes in weight shall be stationed, parked or stored on the land.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To restrict the use of the site to one compatible with the surrounding area and to enable the Local Planning Authority to exercise control over any future intensification use not forming part of this application.",
    "No more than 55 caravans,  as defined in the Caravan Sites and Control of  Development Act 1960 and the Caravan Sites Act 1968 as amended, shall be stationed on the land at any time.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To restrict the use of the site to one compatible with the surrounding area and to enable the Local Planning Authority to exercise control over any future intensification  use not forming part of this application.",
    "The boundary fencing shown on drawing no. 22/BEDFORDS.01 Revision E and in the Revised Design and Access Statement Revision E shall be retained permanently, unless otherwise agreed in writing with the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason: To protect the visual amenities of the development and prevent undue overlooking of adjoining property.",
    "The access to the site shown on drawing no. 22/BEDFORDS.01 Revision E shall be retained permanently, unless otherwise agreed in writing with the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason: To maintain access to the site.",
    "The external lighting shown on Drawing No. 22/BEDFORDS/06 Revision A shall be retained and implemented in full, operated in strict accordance with the approved plans and permanently maintained, unless otherwise agreed in writing with the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason: In the interests of security and residential amenity and in order that the development accords with Policies 7 and 34 of the Havering Local Plan.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: In accordance with paragraph 38 of the National Planning Policy Framework, improvements required to make the proposal acceptable were negotiated with Mr Smith via email on 20th July 2023 and 18th December 2023. The revisions involved altering the description of the proposal, deleting the dayrooms and increasing the number of pitches. The amendments were subsequently submitted on 23rd August and 19th December 2023."
