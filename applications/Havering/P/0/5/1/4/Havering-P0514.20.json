    "The proposed loft conversion comprising the hip to gable roof alteration and rear dormer window would significantly harm the architectural composition of the building and unbalance the symmetrical aspect of the linked pair of property and by reason of their visual prominence in Dunstable Road and Dudley Road appear as an unacceptably dominant and visually intrusive feature in the street scene harmful to the character and appearance of the surrounding area, contrary to Policy DC61 of the London Borough of Havering LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document 2008, the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document 2011 and Policy 7.4 of the London Plan.",
    "The proposed development would, by reason of its position and proximity to neighbouring properties be an intrusive and overbearing form of development thereby causing overlooking/loss of privacy and give rise to an uncomfortable overbearing effect resulting in an increased sense of enclosure harmful to the amenity of No. 2 Dudley Road contrary to the provisions of Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document, the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document and Policy 7.4 of the London Plan.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to the agent, Mr Joel Walsh. Alternative route to make the proposal acceptable were also suggested to the agent on 05/06/2020."
