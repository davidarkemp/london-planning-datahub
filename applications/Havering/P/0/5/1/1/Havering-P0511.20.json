  "decision_conditions": [
    "The siting and design of the proposed dwelling would appear as an incongruous form of development within the street scene, entirely out of character with the surrounding built form and established pattern of development therefore harmful to local character and detrimental to neighbouring residential amenity, contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD.",
    "The proposed development would result in living conditions that do not create a suitably high quality living environment for future occupiers. The constraints of the site in conjunction with the design approach adopted would be to the detriment of the amenity of future occupiers. The constrained plot and arrangement of living accommodation including amenity space would be substandard and give rise to an overwhelming sense of enclosure with poor outlook and access to sunlight, in direct contrast to the aims of London Plan Policy 3.5 and Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD.",
    "The proposed development would, by reason of the inadequate on site car parking provision, result in unacceptable overspill onto the adjoining roads to the detriment of highway safety and residential amenity and contrary to Policies DC33 and DC2 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD.",
    "The proposed development would by reason of its bulk, mass, scale and siting within close proximity of the side boundary, introduce a dominant and visually intrusive feature into the rear garden scene, to the detriment of the amenity of the adjoining neighbour and in conflict with Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to the agent via email.",
    "The proposal, if granted planning permission on appeal, would be liable for the Mayor of London Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). Based upon the information supplied with the application, the CIL payable would be Â£12,450. Further details with regard to CIL are available from the Council's website."
