    "The development hereby permitted shall not be carried out otherwise than in complete accordance with the approved plans (as set out on page one of this decision notice).",
    "Reason:-",
    "For the avoidance of doubt and to ensure that the development is carried out as approved.",
    "Notwithstanding the provisions of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 upon the occupation of the new dwellinghouse, the garage(s)/workshop(s)/utility room(s)/ outbuilding(s) hereby permitted shall be used only for purposes incidental to the enjoyment of the dwelling house and not for any trade or business nor as living accommodation.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To restrict the use to one compatible with a residential area, and in order that the development accords with Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policy DC61.",
    "Within three months of the occupation of the new dwelling, the outbuilding with 2 bedrooms as per drawing PL-5593_07 is to be converted into an outbuilding with no bedrooms as per drawing PL-5593_08. Written notification of the conversion into an outbuilding and cessation of the residential occupation shall be submitted within 1 month of the works having taken place to the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:-",
    "The temporary use of the outbuilding for primarily residential uses is such that permanent permission would not be appropriate in the interests of amenity.  This permission for the outbuilding is therefore granted on a temporary basis to ensure the development accords with the Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policy DC61.",
    "Before any of the commencement of any above ground works, written specification of external walls and roof materials to be used in the construction of the building(s) shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority and thereafter the development shall be constructed with the approved materials.",
    "Reason:-",
    "Insufficient information has been supplied with the application to judge the appropriateness of the materials to be used.  Submission of a written specification prior to commencement will ensure that the appearance of the proposed development will harmonise with the character of the surrounding area and comply with Policy DC61 of the Development Control Policies Development Plan Document.",
    "Notwithstanding the provisions of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015, other than porches erected in accordance with the Order, no extension or enlargement (including additions to roofs) shall be made to the dwellinghouse(s) hereby permitted, or any detached building erected, without the express permission in writing of the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:-",
    "In the interests of amenity and to enable the Local Planning Authority to retain control over future development, and in order that the development accords with Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policy DC61.",
    "All building operations in connection with the construction of external walls, roof, and foundations; site excavation or other external site works; works involving the use of plant or machinery; the erection of scaffolding; the delivery of materials; the removal of materials and spoil from the site, and the playing of amplified music shall only take place between the hours of 8.00am and 6.00pm Monday to Friday, and between 8.00am and 1.00pm on Saturdays and not at all on Sundays and Bank Holidays/Public Holidays.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To protect residential amenity, and in order that the development accords with the Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policy DC61.",
    "Prior to the commencement of any ground works or development of the site, details shall be submitted to and agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority setting out suitable gas protection measures to be employed on site including, but not limited to the installation of a suitable gas resistant membrane.  The gas protection measures shall be carried out in strict accordance with the agreed details.  Upon completion of installation, a 'Verification Report' must be submitted demonstrating that the works have been carried out.",
    "Reason: - Insufficient information has been submitted to ensure that the occupants of the development and property are not subject to any risk from soil gas and/or vapour in accordance with LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD Policy DC53.",
    "The temporary access way as shown on drawing PL-5593_11 shall be in place and appropriately hoarded off prior to construction works of the new dwelling commencing.  The access way is to remain in place until the construction of the new dwelling has been completed.",
    "Reason:-    To ensure safe and continuous access to the outbuilding during construction of the new dwelling.",
    "The proposed windows located on the northern flank wall at first floor level  shall be permanently glazed with obscure glass not less than 3 on the standard scale of obscurity and shall thereafter be maintained.",
    "Reason:-",
    "In the interests of privacy, and in order that the development accords with the Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policy DC61.",
    "Before the development hereby permitted is first commenced, vehicle cleansing facilities to prevent mud being deposited onto the public highway during construction works shall be provided on site in accordance with details to be first submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority. The approved facilities shall be retained thereafter and used at relevant entrances to the site throughout the duration of construction works. If mud or other debris originating from the site is deposited in the public highway, all on-site operations shall cease until it has been removed.",
    "The submission will provide;",
    "a)  A plan showing where vehicles will be parked within the site to be inspected for mud and debris and cleaned if required. The plan should show where construction traffic will access and exit the site from the public highway.",
    "b)  A description of how the parking area will be surfaced, drained and cleaned to prevent mud, debris and muddy water being tracked onto the pu",
    "Notwithstanding the provisions of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015, no window or other opening (other than those shown on the submitted and approved plan,) shall be formed in the flank wall(s) of the building(s) hereby permitted, unless specific permission under the provisions of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 has first been sought and obtained in writing from the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:-",
    "In order to ensure a satisfactory development that will not result in any loss of privacy or damage to the environment of neighbouring properties which exist or may be proposed in the future, and in order that the development accords with Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policy DC61.",
    "Prior to the first occupation of the development, details shall be submitted to and agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority for the installation of Ultra-Low NOx boilers with maximum NOx Emissions less than 40 mg/KWh. Where any installations do not meet this emissions standard it should not be operated without the fitting of suitable NOx abatement equipment or technology as determined by a specialist to ensure comparable emissions.  The installation of the boilers shall be carried out in strict accordance with the agreed details and shall thereafter be permanently retained.  Following installation emissions certificates will need to be provided to the Local Planning Authority to verify boiler emissions.",
    "Reason: To minimise the impact of building emissions on local air quality.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35(2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management) Order 2015: No significant problems were identified during the consideration of the application, and therefore it has been determined in accordance with paragraph 38 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2018.",
    "Changes to the public highway (including permanent or temporary access)",
    "- Planning approval does not constitute approval for changes to the public highway. Highway Authority approval will only be given after suitable details have been submitted considered and agreed. If new or amended access is required (whether temporary or permanent), there may be a requirement for the diversion or protection of third party utility plant or highway authority assets and it is recommended that early involvement with the relevant statutory undertaker takes place. The applicant must contact Engineering Services on 01708 433751 to discuss the scheme and commence the relevant highway approvals process. Please note that unauthorised work on the highway is an offence.",
    "Highway legislation",
    "- The developer (including their representatives and contractors) is advised that planning consent does not discharge the requirements of the New Roads and Street Works Act 1991 and the Traffic Management Act 2004. Formal"
