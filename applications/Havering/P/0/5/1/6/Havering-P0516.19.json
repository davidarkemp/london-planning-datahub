  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed side extension and first floor extension would, by reason of its excessive depth, height and position close to the common boundary of the site with no. 58 &60  Stanley Road North, be an overbearing, intrusive and unneighbourly development as well as having an adverse effect on the amenities of adjacent occupiers contrary to the London Borough of Havering Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD 2008, and the London Borough of Havering Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD Adopted 2011.",
    "The proposed development would, by reason of its height, bulk and mass, appear as an unacceptably dominant and visually intrusive feature in the streetscene harmful to the appearance of the surrounding area contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD. In addition, the increase in the eaves height of the first floor extension above the eaves of the host dwelling results in a contrived and awkward form of design which would fail to respect the design or character of the host dwelling and surrounding area.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to Mr Little by email 05/0819."
