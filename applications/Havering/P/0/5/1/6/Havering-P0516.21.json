    "Prior to occupation of the development hereby approved, details of a scheme shall be submitted to an approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority which specifies the provision to be made for the control of noise emanating from the site. Such scheme as may be approved shall be implemented prior to first occupation and thereafter retained in accordance with such details",
