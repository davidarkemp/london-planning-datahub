    "In the absence of one year of continuous active marketing evidence to clearly demonstrate that there is no market interest in the site, the application is contrary to Policy 20 of the Havering Local Plan, Policy E4 of the London Plan and the guidance in the National Planning Policy Framework.",
    "There is poor access for attendees, including wheelchair users and people with buggies/children to Units 5 and 6 on the first floor of the building and the resultant impact on pedestrian safety, as there is no separate pedestrian access to the front entrance of the building, particularly given the siting and proximity of the Romford Motors MOT and car workshop centre with vehicles entering, manoeuvring and exiting the site as well as cars parking within the site contrary to Policy 16 of the Havering Local Plan, Policies D5 and S1  of the London Plan and the National Planning Policy Framework.",
    "In the absence of a noise report and any evidence otherwise, the uses generate noise from the venue and high levels of activity through comings, goings as well as noise and disturbance to the detriment of neighbouring amenity, particularly during the days and hours of use and evening hours of operation contrary to Policies 7, 16 and 34 of the Havering Local Plan, Policies D14 and S1 of the London Plan and the National Planning Policy Framework in particular Paragraph 135 which amongst other considerations requires development provide a high standard of amenity.",
