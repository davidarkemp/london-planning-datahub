    "The proposed dwellings through their design, positioning and site layout would form an isolated, incongruous and visually cramped form of development at odds with surrounding character in an environment more familiar with subordinate outbuildings. The proposals would therefore be contrary to Policies 10, 7 and 26 of the Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 and also Paragraph 130(a) of the NPPF which requires fundamentally that development add to the overall quality of the area whilst also establishing or maintaining a strong sense of place.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, it was necessary to issue a decision as close to the statutory timeframe as possible as opposed to seeking amendments which would have significantly delayed the application.",
    "In the event that this application is allowed through the appeals process the proposals would be liable for the following CIL contributions:",
    "Mayoral CIL (MCIL2) contribution of £3510 (x £25 per sqm).",
    "Havering CIL (HCIL) contribution of £17,550 (x £125 per sqm)",
    "Each contribution would be subject to indexation."
