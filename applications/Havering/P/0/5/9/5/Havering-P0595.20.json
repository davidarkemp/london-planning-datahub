    "Reason:-",

    "Reason:-",
    "In order to ensure a satisfactory development that will not result in any loss of privacy or damage to the environment of neighbouring properties which exist or may be proposed in the future, and in order that the development accords with Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policy DC61.",

    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: In accordance with paragraph 38 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2018, improvements required to make the proposal acceptable were negotiated with Jeetender Singh. The revisions involved removal of the part gabled roof to the side to rather have a hipped finish, removal of the staggered two storey side extension to rather be straight and increasing the setback away from the boundary with the footway. The amendments were subsequently submitted on 6 July 2020."
