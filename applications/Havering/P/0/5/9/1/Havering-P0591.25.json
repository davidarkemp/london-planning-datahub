    "The hip-to-gable roof alteration is not subservient to the roof of the subject property because it has altered the basic shape of the roof on the semi-detached dwelling which is unacceptable as it imbalances the pair of houses through a bulky roof form to one half causing a negative effect on the street scene by the loss of symmetry. Accordingly the roof alteration undertaken is of a poor quality design and contrary to the purposes and intent of Local Plan Policies 7 and 26 and the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document.",
    "The rear dormer window in-situ, by reason of its bulk, scale, massing and inappropriate use of materials, appears as a dominant and visually intrusive feature detrimental to the character and appearance of the host property and visual amenity of the rear garden environment, contrary to Local Plan Policies 7 and 26 of the Havering Local Plan and the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reasons for it was given to the agent via email on 07/07/2025."
