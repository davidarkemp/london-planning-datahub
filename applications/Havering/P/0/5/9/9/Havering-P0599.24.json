    "The proposed development would result in living conditions that do not create a suitably high quality living environment for future occupiers. The constraints of the site, in conjunction with the position of the neighbouring two storey rear extension, would be to the detriment of the amenity of future occupiers. The constrained plot and arrangement of amenity space  poor access arrangements and poor aspect and outlook in close proximity of the neighbouring boundary with No.54/54A Collier Row Lane, would be substandard and result in a poor quality living environment, contrary to the aims of the NPPF, Policy 7 of the Havering Local Plan and Policy D6 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "The lack of car parking provision for the enlarged flat would result of an overspill of vehicles onto surrounding streets, contrary to Policy 24 of the Havering Local Plan and T6.1 of the London Plan.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to Mr Baradiya by e-mail on 08/07/24.",
    "NOTE: Should planning permission be granted on appeal or by subsequent application, the applicant should be aware that the lawful use of the flat is a C3 Dwelling and the premises should remain as a self contained flat. London Borough of Havering have an Article 4 Direction in place that means that use of the premises as an C4 HMO would require planning permission.",
    "For mixed use development Retail is £50/m² and Residential is £125/m².",
    "Please be advised that approval of this application from 1st September 2019 (either by London Borough of Havering, or subsequently by PINS if allowed on appeal following a refusal by London Borough of Havering) will attract a liability payment of £22,350 plus indexation in Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This charge has been levied under s.206 of the Planning Act 2008 and includes both the Mayor of London's CIL and London Borough of Haverings CIL.",
    "London Borough of Havering, as CIL collecting authority, has responsibility for the collection of the Mayoral CIL, in addition to Havering's CIL, on commencement of the development.",
