    "The proposed side / rear extension, by virtue of its siting on the side boundary, massing, design and combined depth is considered to appear as an incongruous and overly dominant addition to the existing dwelling which is detrimental to the visual character of the surrounding street scene. The proposal thereby fails to raise the standard of design more generally in the area and is contrary to part (b) to Paragraph 139 of the National Planning Policy Framework, Policies 7, 26, D1, D4 of the Havering Local Plan (2016) and the Havering Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD (2011).",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy a decision was made on the application, which will enable the applicant to exercise a right of appeal if they so wish."
