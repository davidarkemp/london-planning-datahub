    "It is considered that the proposed boundary treatment would by reason of its height and design appear as an incongruous and prominent feature in the street scene, adding visual clutter to the streetscene, out of character with the prevailing pattern of development to the detriment of the visual amenity of the host property and locality contrary to policy DC61 of the London Borough of Havering Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD 2008, the Emerson Park Policy Area SPD 2009, the Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD 2011 and the Landscaping SPD 2011.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it were given to Mr Wright via email on 3 July 2020.",
    "It should be noted that, if the planning application were to be won on appeal, it would not override any existing deeds or covenants or other legal agreements tied to the property. It has been suggested in objections from neighbours that there is a restrictive covenant that exists over the land that would prohibit the development of any boundary walls or fencing to the properties in Barleycorn Way.",
    "The Council does not have access to any deeds or covenants on properties or the land registry titles and that such matters are not considered within the remit of planning regime."
