  "decision_conditions": [
    "The development to which this permission relates must be commenced not later than three years from the date of this permission.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To comply with the requirements of Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended by Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004).",
    "The development hereby permitted shall not be carried out otherwise than in complete accordance with the approved plans (as set out on page one of this decision notice).",
    "Reason:-",
    "The Local Planning Authority consider it essential that the whole of the development is carried out and that no departure whatsoever is made from the details approved, since the development would not necessarily be acceptable if partly carried out or carried out differently in any degree from the details submitted.  Also, in order that the development accords with Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policy DC61.",
    "The proposed development hereby approved shall be constructed in accordance with the materials detailed under Section 5 of the application form unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason: To ensure that the appearance of the proposed development will harmonise with the character of the surrounding area and comply with Policy DC61 of the Development Control Policies Development Plan Document",
    "Notwithstanding the provisions of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 the outbuilding (shed / study) hereby permitted shall be used only for purposes incidental to the enjoyment of the dwelling house and for no other purpose nor be sub-let.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To restrict the use to one compatible with a residential area, and in order that the development accords with Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policy DC61.",
    "The applicant is reminded that this permission does not give right of encroachment on any land outside of the applicants control. This includes guttering or other parts of the development overhanging to neighbouring properties.",
    "It is noted that there is a raised cemented area with two steps in front of the existing outbuilding that is not part of this application. As the raised area was not included in the plans submitted, the measurements are not known. Any raised areas should be no more than 300mm high from the ground level otherwise it will require planning permission in its own right.",
    "The site is located in the Industrial 50m buffer zone and the Landfill 250m buffer zone, therefore any development with habitable spaces that would be used frequently and for long periods of time would require a gas membrane to mitigate health hazards. It is noted that the proposal is for a shed use and should not be used for a habitable use at any time as no evidence of a gas membrane being included in the development of the outbuilding was presented to the Council during assessment of this application.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: In accordance with paragraph 38 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2018, improvements required to make the proposal acceptable were negotiated with Marcel Hurst via email. The revisions involved changing the proposed use of the outbuilding from a study and shed to only a shed use. The amendments were subsequently submitted on 9 June 2020."
