    "The proposed detached garage, by reason of its scale, bulk, mass and position forward of the application dwelling, would appear as an unacceptably dominant and visually intrusive feature in the streetscene harmful to the appearance of the surrounding area contrary to the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document and Policies DC61 and DC69 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document and Policy 7.4 of the London Plan.",
    "The proposed development would, by reason of its close proximity to the preserved tree protected by Tree Preservation Order 1-17, be likely to result in unacceptable harm being caused to the health and safety of a protected tree; this would be materially harmful to the character and amenity of the street scene and surrounding area, contrary to Policy DC60 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document and the Protection of Trees during Development Supplementary Planning Document.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to Mr Martin by e-mail on 06/06/19."
