    "The proposed layout of the development would be inadequate resulting in a poor quality living environment for future residents through no internal separation between Flats 1 & 2, which would result in a lack of privacy and be harmful to the amenity for future occupiers as well as the lack of provision of built-in storage contrary to Policy DC61 of the Local Development Framework Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document, the DCLG Technical Housing Standards and Policy D6 of the London Plan.",
    "The internal layout would be likely to lead to an unacceptable noise and general disturbance to the attached neighbouring property at No. 35 Rosewood Avenue. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies DC4 and DC61 of the Local Development Framework Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document and the National Planning Policy Framework.",
    "The proposed development would, by reason of a lack of an outdoor private amenity area for the proposed first and second floor flat - Flat 2, be harmful to the amenity of future occupiers contrary to Policy DC61 of the Local Development Framework Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document, the Design for Living Supplementary Planning Document and Policy D6 of the London Plan.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to Mr Harmon via email on 28th June 2021."
