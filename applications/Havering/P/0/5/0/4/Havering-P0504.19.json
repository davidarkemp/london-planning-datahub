    "The proposed two storey side/rear extension would, by reason of its scale, bulk, mass and crowned roof form and its position close to the boundaries of the site, appear cramped, incongruous, dominant and visually intrusive in the streetscene and rear garden environment. This will be harmful to the open and spacious character and appearance of the surrounding area and contrary to the Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD and Policies DC61 and DC69 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD.",
    "The proposed two storey side/rear extension would, by reason of its height and position close to the boundaries of the site, be an intrusive and unneighbourly development, which would be most oppressive, overbearing and give rise to an undue sense of enclosure to the detriment of residential amenity of the adjacent occupiers at No.31 Brook Road Romford contrary to the Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD and Policies DC61 and DC69 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to Acres Architects (agent) by e-mail on 18/06/19.",
    "The proposal, if granted planning permission on appeal, would be liable for the Mayor of London Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). Based upon the information supplied with the application, the CIL payable would be Â£3,700. Further details with regard to CIL are available from the Council's website."
