    "The proposed development, having regards to the cumulative scale, width, bulk and mass of the hip to gable roof alterations and rear dormer window, would fail to satisfactorily integrate with the original design of the building and would be out of scale and character with the host dwelling and the immediate surrounding area. As such, the proposals are contrary to Policy 7 of the Local Plan and the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document.",
    "The proposed rear dormer window, by reason of its scale, bulk and mass would appear out of scale and character with the dwelling and materially harmful to the visual amenity of the surrounding area contrary to Policy 7 and 26 of the Havering Local Plan, the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document and Policy 7.4 of the London Plan.",
