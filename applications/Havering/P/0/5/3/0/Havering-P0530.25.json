    "The proposed loft conversion and rear dormer would, by reason of its size, scale, bulk and position close to the shared boundaries, would result in an unduly dominant, overbearing and visually intrusive form of development that would have an adverse impact on the amenity of the adjoining occupiers at No.s 20a and No.24 Hood Road and immediate surrounding properties, contrary to Local Plan Policy 7 of the Havering Local Plan (adopted 2021) and the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document (2011).",
    "The proposed two storey side extension would, by reason of its orientation, siting, size and scale, lead to loss of sun/daylight, harmful overshadowing and an overbearing form of development that would have an adverse effect on the amenity of the adjoining occupiers at No.20a Hood Road, contrary to Policy 7 of the Havering Local Plan (adopted 2021) and the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document (2011).",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy a decision was made on the application, which will enable the applicant to exercise a right of appeal if they so wish."
