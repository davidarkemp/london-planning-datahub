    "In the absence of detailed inforrmation regarding the nature of the use, times and hours of operation, the likely levels of use, servicing requirements and measures to control the demand for parking, it is considered likely that the proposed  use, by reason of insufficient on site parking, is likely to result in a material increase in on street parking causing likely traffic flow problems contrary to Policy 24 of the Local Plan 2021.",
    "The proposal results in loss of industrial floorspace and is thereby contrary to policy 20 of the Local Plan 2021 which seeks the retention of non designated industrial sites unless it is demonstrated that there would be no need for such uses through demonstrable marketing evidence.",
    "Insufficient information has been provided with respect to the hours of use, the number of patrons and the nature of the operation of the proposed use.  As such, given the location of the site in relation to residential properties, the proposal is considered likely to result in an unacceptable level of noise and disturbance to the amenities of occupiers of nearby residential property from levels of activity and associated noise and from vehicles entering and exiting the site, particularly as this may occur at a time when the nearby residential occupiers expect a degree of calm and tranquillity. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies 7 and 34 of the Local Plan 2021.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to applicant on 12.06.2025."
