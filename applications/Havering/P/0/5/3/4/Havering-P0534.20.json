    "The proposed two storey side extension by reason of its scale, bulk, mass, roof design, cramped appearance, together with its lack of subservience and setback, would unbalance the appearance of this semi-detached pair of houses and appear as an unacceptably dominant and visually intrusive feature in the streetscene and rear garden, harmful to the appearance of the surrounding area contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document, the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document and Policy 7.4 of the London Plan.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to Mr Stott-Brookes (Agent) by e-mail on 15th June 2020."
