    "The proposed single storey rear extension would, by reason of its depth, height and position close to the south-east shared boundary, would lead to an overbearing and unduly prominent form of development that would harm the amenity of the neighbouring occupiers at No.19 Erroll Road, contrary to Policy 7 of the Havering Local Plan (adopted 2021) and the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document (2011).",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: In accordance with paragraph 38 of the National Planning Policy Framework, improvements required to make the proposal acceptable were negotiated with the applicant/agent via email on 24/06/2025.
