    "The proposed development by reason of its excessive bulk, scale and size, would be incongruous in the rear garden scene and would be harmful to the character of the original house and surrounding area, contrary to Havering's Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD (adopted 2011), and Policy DC61 of the Core Strategy and Development Control DPD (adopted 2008).",
    "The proposed first floor rear extension would, by reason of its excessive depth, height and position close to the boundaries of the site, be an intrusive and unneighbourly development as well as having an adverse effect on the amenities of adjacent occupiers at no. 8 Babington Road regarding an increased sense of enclosure and overbearing development, contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD and Havering's Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document (adopted 2011).",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal for it was given to Mr Devrim Sahin (agent), via email on 24 June 2020."
