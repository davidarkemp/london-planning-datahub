    "The layout of the development would be inadequate resulting in substandard accommodation for future residents through insufficient internal space with regards to bedroom sizes, thereby giving rise to a poor quality residential environment, harmful to the amenities of the occupiers.  As a result, the development would be contrary to Policy 7 of the Havering Local Plan and Policy D6 of the London Plan.",
    "The proposed development would, by reason of its height, positioning close to the side boundary, bulk and mass, appear as a dominant and visually intrusive development, which would unduly enclose the street scene at this prominent location and would also give rise to a form of development which is at odds with the prevailing character of development in the locality, thereby materially harmful to the character and appearance of the surrounding area, contrary to  Policy 7 and 26 of the Havering Local Plan.",
    "The proposal would provide no parking for the new dwelling leading to an increased demand for on-road parking in the area to the detriment of the safety and functioning of the highway contrary to Policy 24 and 26 of the Havering Local Plan and Policy T6 of the London Plan.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, it was necessary to issue a decision as close to the statutory timeframe as possible as opposed to seeking amendments which would have significantly delayed the application.",
    "The proposal, if granted planning permission on appeal, would be liable for the Mayor of London and Havering Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). Based upon the information supplied with the application, the Mayoral CIL payable would be Â£2207.50 based on Â£25.00 per square metre and the Havering Community Infrastructure Levy (HCIL) would be a charge of Â£13,245 based on calculation of Â£125 per square metre. Each would be subject to indexation.",
    "Further details with regard to CIL are available from the Council's website."
