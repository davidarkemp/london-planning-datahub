    "The proposed extensions and increased roof height would, by reason of their cumulative scale, bulk and proximity to no.21 Askwith Road, give rise to an intrusive and overbearing form of development that would be an intrusive and unneighbourly development as well as having an adverse effect on the amenities of adjacent occupiers contrary to Policy 7 of the Havering Local Plan and the Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD.",
    "The difficult and unpractical access the rear garden would give rise to a poor quality living environment for future occupiers of the flats, contrary to Policy 7 and 9 of the Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 and Policy D6 of the London Plan.",
    "The original floor space of each of the existing dwellings is less than 120 square metres, contrary to Policy 9 of the Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 and Policy D6 of the London Plan.",
    "Please be advised that approval of this application from 1st September 2019 (either by London Borough of Havering, or subsequently by PINS if allowed on appeal following a refusal by London Borough of Havering) will attract a liability payment plus indexation in Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This charge has been levied under s.206 of the Planning Act 2008 and includes both the Mayor of London's CIL and Havering Council's CIL.",
    "London Borough of Havering, as CIL collecting authority, has responsibility for the collection of the Mayoral CIL, in addition to Havering's CIL, on commencement of the development.",
    "Your proposal is subject to a CIL Liability Notice indicating a levy of £4403.50 plus indexation for the application, based on the Mayoral CIL levy rate for Havering of £25/sq.m plus Havering's charging rate for residential of £125/sq.m of £22,017.50 based on 176.14 square metres of additional floor space.",
    "You are advised to visit the planning portal website where you can",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, it was necessary to issue a decision as close to the statutory timeframe as possible as opposed to seeking amendments which would have significantly delayed the application."
