    "In order to ensure a satisfactory development that will not result in any loss of privacy or damage to the environment of neighbouring properties which exist or may be proposed in the future, and in order that the development accords with Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policy DC61.",
    "The implementation of both D0148.20 and P0555.20 and the single storey side/rear extension which was allowed on appeal under planning reference P0136.19 at the same time may invalidate the Certificate of Lawfulness as the proposal would be contrary to the approved plans and the resultant volume may exceed the 50 cubic metres allowance allowed for the proposed loft extension under permitted development.",
    "As such, the works shown as part of this application P0555.20 should be constructed once, D0148.20 for the side dormer windows and hip to gable to the rear has been constructed in its entirety. otherwise this may effect the cumulative volume added to the dwelling house.",
