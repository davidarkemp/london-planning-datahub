    "The proposed business use , which operates independently of the main dwelling, would give rise to material harm to the character and amenity of the locality, by introduction of a commercial use which would give rise to unacceptable levels of noise and acitivity from comings and goings, and the drop off, pick up/collection of laundry, with the potential to take place at unreasonable hours of the day, in close proximity to neighbouring residential properties.  The likely potential scale and intensity of the use is considered not to be adequately able to be controlled by conditions and would be harmful to and would fundamentally alter the residential character of the locality and result in an intensification of the use of the site beyond that acceptable within a residential environment contrary to Policies 26 and 34 of the Havering Local Plan 2016-2031, Paragraph 130 of the NPPF and London Plan 2021 Policies D3 and D13.",
    "The proposal does not make adequate provision for parking for both the donor property and the proposed laundry business and would create vehicle movement to and from the site where there is observed to be existing parking stress. The likely increase in vehicle movement associated with the business operation would lead to increased parking stress and increased competition for on-street parking spaces therefore contrary to Polices 7, 23 and 24 of the Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 and also London Plan 2021 Policy T6.",
