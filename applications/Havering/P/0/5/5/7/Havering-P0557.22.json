    "The development hereby permitted shall not be carried out otherwise than in complete accordance with the approved plans (as set out on page one of this decision notice).",
    "Reason:-",
    "For the avoidance of doubt and to ensure that the development is carried out as approved.",
    "Within 9 months of the determination of application P0557.22, written specification of external walls and roof materials to be used in the construction of the building(s) shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority and thereafter the development shall be constructed with the approved materials.",
    "Reason:-",
    "Insufficient information has been supplied with the application to judge the appropriateness of the materials to be used.  Submission of a written specification prior to commencement will ensure that the appearance of the proposed development will harmonise with the character of the surrounding area.",
    "Notwithstanding the provisions of Classes B and C to Part 1 of Schedule 2 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 1995 (as amended), no alterations shall be made to the roof of the dwelling hereby approved without the prior written approval of the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:-",
    "In the interests of amenity and to enable the Local Planning Authority to retain control over future development.",
    "All building operations in connection with the construction of external walls, roof, and foundations; site excavation or other external site works; works involving the use of plant or machinery; the erection of scaffolding; the delivery of materials; the removal of materials and spoil from the site, and the playing of amplified music shall only take place between the hours of 8.00am and 6.00pm Monday to Friday, and between 8.00am and 1.00pm on Saturdays and not at all on Sundays and Bank Holidays/Public Holidays.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To protect residential amenity.",
    "Changes to the public highway (including permanent or temporary access)",
    "- Planning approval does not constitute approval for changes to the public highway. Highway Authority approval will only be given after suitable details have been submitted considered and agreed. If new or amended access is required (whether temporary or permanent), there may be a requirement for the diversion or protection of third party utility plant or highway authority assets and it is recommended that early involvement with the relevant statutory undertaker takes place. The applicant must contact Engineering Services on 01708 433751 to discuss the scheme and commence the relevant highway approvals process. Please note that unauthorised work on the highway is an offence.",
    "Highway legislation",
    "- The developer (including their representatives and contractors) is advised that planning consent does not discharge the requirements of the New Roads and Street Works Act 1991 and the Traffic Management Act 2004. Formal"
