    "The proposed dwelling through its design, scale, bulk, depth and proximity to the shared boundaries would form an incongruous and visually cramped form of development at odds with the character of the surrounding  area to the detriment of the visual amenity of the locality. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policy 26 of the Havering Local Plan 2016-2031, Policy D4 of the London Plan and also the guidance within the NPPF which requires fundamentally that development add to the overall quality of the area whilst also establishing or maintaining a strong sense of place.",
    "The proposed dwelling would form a visually intrusive and overbearing feature within the rear garden environment due to the excessive depth of the proposed rear projections and their proximity to the shared boundaries which would be detrimental to neighbouring amenity and therefore be contrary to Policies 7 and 26 of the Havering Local Plan 2016-2031. There would also be conflict with the National Planning Policy Framework.",
    "In the absence of an Arboricultural Impact Assessment, there is a lack of information to identify the impacts from the proposed development to the trees on site. There are concerns that the proposed development would, by reason of its siting, result in harm to the oak tree on the site protected by Tree Preservation Order 23-87 and the other trees within the site, which would be materially harmful to the character and amenity of the surrounding area contrary to Policy 27 of the Havering Local Plan, G7 of the London Plan and the guidance contained in the National Planning Policy Framework.",

This charge has been levied under s.206 of the Planning Act 2008 and includes both the Mayor of London's CIL and Havering Council's CIL.",
