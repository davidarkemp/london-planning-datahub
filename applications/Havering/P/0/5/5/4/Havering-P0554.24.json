    "The proposed take-away use would be within 400m walking distance from a primary school. Accordingly its siting is considered not to provide opportunities for healthy lifestyles, especially for school-age children and not to contribute to the creation of healthier communities contrary to Policy E9 of the London Plan and Policy 12 of the Havering Local Plan 2016-2031.",
    "The proposals are through a combination of the inappropriateness of the use and hours proposed, levels of potential activity including patron and delivery aggregate at unneighbourly hours, uncertainty over noise from equipment/plant and sound-proofing, contrary to the objectives of Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 Policies 13 and 34 through being detrimental to the amenity of surrounding occupiers. There would also be conflict with the objectives of the NPPF, in particular Para 135 which requires development to provide a high standard of amenity for existing and future users.",
    "The hours of use proposed (that given in the Planning Statement and the Application form discrepancy between the two aside) are not in keeping with the character of the parade and the use would generate activity that the existing parade/surrounds are unfamiliar with. This would present in activity, noise and movement to and from the site at a time where the rest of the parade would have ceased. It is reasonable to conclude that based on the type of activity generated in the evening this would materially change the character of the parade. The proposals are therefore not in compliance with the objectives of Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 Policy 26 and the objectives of Para 135 of the NPPF which requires development add to the overall quality of the area and not undermine quality of life or community cohesion.",
    "The proposed mechanical extract ventilation equipment/flue would be a prominent and unsightly feature in the street-scene owing to its position on a prominent flank wall. It is considered not to adequately consider the character of the parade and wider street-scene, fundamentally the suburban character of the immediate context and is therefore not in compliance withHavering Local Plan 2016-2031 Policy 26 and the objectives of the NPPF, specifically Para 135 which requires fundamentally that development is visually attractive, add to the overall quality of the area and be sympathetic to local character including the surrounding built environment.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to the agent in writing 18-07-2024."
