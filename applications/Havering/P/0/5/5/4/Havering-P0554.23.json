    "The proposed dwelling would, by reason of its siting, layout, design and configuration would fail to provide adequate outlook for the proposed rear living area habitable rooms. Additionally, the proposed unattached neighbour at No 12. Deveron Way benefits from a double storey rear extension within close proximity which would directly overlook into the rear garden environment of the proposed dwelling.  Overall it is considered that the proposal would fail to provide an acceptable degree of outlook and amenity for future occupants contrary to Policies 7, 26 of the Havering Local Plan and Policy D6 of the London Plan.",
    "The outlook from the rear windows of the existing dwelling at No. 12 Deveron Way would be unacceptably impacted by the proposed development. Given the dwelling would extend beyond the rear of the existing dwelling it would appear as an intrusive and overbearing form of development particularly when viewed from the rear garden environment contrary to Policies 7, 26 of the Havering Local Plan.",
