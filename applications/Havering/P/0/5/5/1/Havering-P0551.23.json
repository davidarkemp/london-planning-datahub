    "The development to which this permission relates must be commenced not later than three years from the date of this permission.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To comply with the requirements of Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended by Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004).",
    "All new external finishes shall be carried out in materials to match those of the existing building(s) to the satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To safeguard the appearance of the premises and the character of the immediate area.",
    "The development hereby permitted shall not be carried out otherwise than in complete accordance with the approved plans (as set out on page one of this decision notice).",
    "Reason:-",
    "For the avoidance of doubt and to ensure that the development is carried out as approved.",
    "The proposed flank windows serving the shower and utility room, shown on drawing nos.28_MR_PA_03 Rev A and 06 Rev B shall be permanently glazed with obscure glass not less than level 3 on the standard scale of obscurity and shall thereafter be maintained and permanently fixed shut and thereafter maintained, with the exception of any top hung fanlight(s).",
    "Reason:-",
    "In the interests of privacy.",
    "Notwithstanding the provisions of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015, no window or other opening (other than those shown on the submitted and approved plan,) shall be formed in the flank wall(s) of the building(s) hereby permitted, unless specific permission under the provisions of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 has first been sought and obtained in writing from the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:-",
    "In order to ensure a satisfactory development that will not result in any loss of privacy or damage to the environment of neighbouring properties which exist or may be proposed in the future.",
    "The roof area of the extension hereby permitted shall not be used as a balcony, roof garden or similar amenity area without the grant of further specific permission from the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:-",
    "In the interests of the amenity of the occupiers of neighbouring dwelling.",
    "Prior to the commencement of any groundworks or development of the site, details shall be submitted to and agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority setting out suitable has protection measures to be employed on site including, but not necessarily limited to, the installation of a suitable has resistant membrane, in compliance with BS 8485:2015. The gas protection measures shall be carried out in strict accordance with the agreed details.",
    "Upon completion of installation, a 'Verification Report' must be submitted demonstrating that the works have been carried out.",
    "Reason:-",
    "The development is situated on or within 250 metres of a current or historic landfill site or gravel pit.  Insufficient information has been supplied with the application to judge the risk arising from landfill gases.  Submission of an assessment prior to commencement will protect those redeveloping this site and any future occupants from potential landfill gas.",
    "This planning permission does not remove the need to obtain any separate consent of the owner of the adjoining property prior to commencing building works on, under, above or immediately adjacent to their property (e.g. foundations or guttering). The Party Wall Etc. Act 1996 contains requirements to serve notice on adjoining owners of property under certain circumstances, and a procedure exists for resolving disputes. This is a matter of civil law between the two parties, and the Local Planning Authority are not involved in such matters.",
    "A free guide called \"The Party Wall Etc Act 1996: Explanatory Booklet\" is available on the website of the Department for Communities and Local Government.",
    "https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-party-wall-etc-act-1996-revised-explanatory-booklet",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: In accordance with paragraph 38 of the National Planning Policy Framework, improvements required to make the proposal acceptable were negotiated with the agent via email. The revisions involved reducing the depth of the rear extension to 4m. The amendments were subsequently submitted on 01/06/2023.",
    "The applicant is advised that the rear extension must be undertaken as a separate building operation from the construction of loft conversion which was awarded a Lawful Development Certificate under application D0153.23. Failure to do so may result in any permitted development rights under D0153.23 becoming void."
