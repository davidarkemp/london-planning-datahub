    "The proposed two storey side extension would, by reason of its excessive width, scale, bulk, and mass would unacceptably unbalance the appearance of this pair of semi-detached house and appear as a dominant and visually intrusive feature, harmful to the appearance of the surrounding area, contrary to Policy 26 of the Havering Local Plan, London Plan Policy D4, the NPPF and the design guidance within the Council's Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD.",
    "The proposed two storey side extension would, by reason of its excessive height and position close to the boundaries of the site, be an intrusive and unneighbourly development as well as having an adverse effect on the amenities of adjacent occupiers at No.76 Woburn Avenue, Hornchurch contrary to Policies 7 of the Havering Local Plan and the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to Kibreya Jahangir and Aysha Jahangirby e-mail on 07th April 2025."
