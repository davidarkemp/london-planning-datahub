  "application_type": "All Other",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed dwelling would read as a dominant and visually intrusive piece of development. It would through its scale, bulk and mass and position close to the side boundary of site, be at odds with the existing pattern of development and would erode the spacious character present through closing down the space between the flank elevation and back-edge of the foot-way, at odds with the spacious character of the street-scene. The two storey reer element would unacceptably add to the bulk of the dwelling and degree of visual intrusion, as seen from Stour Way. It would therefore be harmful to the character and appearance of the area and prevailing pattern of development contrary to policies D1 and D4 of the London Plan, Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD. There would also be conflict with paragraph 127 of the National Planning Policy Framework (the Framework) which states that developments should function well, add to the overall quality of the area",
    "The proposal, if granted planning permission on appeal, would be liable for the Mayor of London Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) as well as Havering Community Infrastructure Levy (HCIL). Based upon the information supplied with the application, the CIL payable would be:",
    "MCIL - £2,550",
    "HCIL - £12,750",
    "Further details with regard to CIL are available from the Council's website.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, it was necessary to issue a decision as close to the statutory timeframe as possible as opposed to seeking amendments which would have significantly delayed the application."
