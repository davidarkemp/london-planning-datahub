  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposal, by reason of the design, proportions and external materials of the proposed development appears as an isolated and unrelated addition to the roofscape, that is also materially out of keeping with the character, appearance and proportions of this building of local heritage interest and is thereby detrimental to the character and quality of the locality, as well as harmful to this strategic arrival location within Romford, contrary to the provisions of Policies DC61 and DC67 of the London Borough of Havering Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD 2008.",
    "The proposal, by reason of the lack of suitable external amenity space, poor outlook and reliance on single aspect units, poor quality access and servicing arrangements for residents and exposure to noise and disturbance would, in combination, result in a poor quality living environment for future occupiers of the proposed development, which would be contrary to the provisions of Policy DC61 of the  London Borough of Havering Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD 2008, as well as the Residential Design SPD 2011.",
    "The proposal would fail to make adequate provision for the servicing of the proposed development, in particular by failing to demonstrate that suitable and convenient access to secure refuse storage facilities can be provided within the site, contrary to the provisions of Policy DC36 of the London Borough of Havering Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD 2008.",
    "The proposal fails to demonstrate the site can suitably provide for cycle storage within the development, contrary to the provisions of Policy DC35 of the London Borough of Havering Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD 2008.",
    "The proposal, in combination with the previously approved residential development on this site, would trigger the requirement for affordable housing.  No details of affordable housing provision have been submitted with the application and this is contrary to the provisions of Policy DC6 of the  London Borough of Havering Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD 2008.",
    "In the absence of a legal agreement to secure contributions towards the demand for school places arising from the development, the proposal fails to satisfactorily mitigate the infrastructure impact of the development, contrary to the provisions of Policies DC29 and DC72 of the  London Borough of Havering Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD 2008 and Policy 8.2 of the London Plan 2016.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to Mr Dal Sanger, via telephone on 8/5/19",
    "The proposal, if granted planning permission on appeal, would be liable for the Mayor of London Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). Based upon the information supplied with the application, the CIL payable would be Â£4425 . Further details with regard to CIL are available from the Council's website."
