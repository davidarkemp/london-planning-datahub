    "The cumulative impact of the proposed single/two storey rear extension, the roof alteration to the existing dwelling and the rear dormer window would be out of scale, be disproportionately large, overly prominent and relate unacceptably to the existing dwelling with a top heavy appearance and appear as an unacceptably dominant and visually intrusive feature in the street scene and rear garden harmful to the appearance of the surrounding area, contrary to Policy 27 of the Havering Local Plan and the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to @Architect Ltd by e-mail on 19-04-23.",
