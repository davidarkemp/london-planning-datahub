    "The original dwelling has a gross internal floor space of 72.14 square metres, which fails to meet the standard of 120 square metres contrary to Policy 8 of the Havering Local Plan. The proposal would therefore have an adverse impact on the supply of family housing within the Borough, the loss of which is not adequately justified and which could set an undesirable precedent for similar development in the locality.",
    "The communal living area (kitchen/diner/living area) fails to provide adequate usable space for the occupiers of the property which would provide a poor quality living environment harmful to the amenity of future occupiers contrary to Policy 8 of the Havering Local Plan and the HMO East London Guidance.",
    "The proposal would result in an intensification of activity at the site and result in significant harm to residential amenity from noise, disturbance and activity, where comings and goings are likely to be particularly noticeable contrary to Policies 7 and 8 of the Havering Local Plan.",
    "Planning Enforcement Investigation Informative",
    "This application is subject to a Planning Enforcement investigation and given the refusal of this application formal enforcement action may therefore be taken.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to Mr Coward via email on 09/04/2025."
