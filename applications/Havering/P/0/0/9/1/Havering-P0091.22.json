  "description": "Conversion of two storey dwelling into 2 x 2-bed self contained flats, involving two storey side extension, part single part two storey rear extension, and demolition of existing garage and rear conservatory",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed development would fail to make provision for the minimum requirement of one three bedroom family unit required in conversions and subdivisions as set out within Policy 9 of the Havering Local Plan 2016-2031.",
    "The proposed layout of Bedroom 2 of the first floor flat would be inadequate resulting in substandard accommodation for future residents through lack of internal space. As a result, the development represents an overdevelopment of the site contrary to Policy 7 of the Havering Local Plan and Policy D6 of the London Plan.",
    "The existing house has a gross internal floor space of approximately 84 square metres which does not meet the minimum standard of 120 square metres of original floor space and therefore is contrary to section ii of Policy 9 of the Havering Local Plan.",
    "In the absence of a legal agreement to prevent future occupants from applying for or obtaining a residents parking permit, the proposal fails to satisfactorily mitigate the parking impacts of the development, contrary to the provisions of Policy 24 of the Havering Local Plan (2016-2031) and Policy T6.1 of the London Plan.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to Mr Brandon (Agent) via email on 17th March 2022.",
    "For Residential Development Only",
    "Please be advised that approval of this application from 1st September 2019 (either by London Borough of Havering, or subsequently by PINS if allowed on appeal following a refusal by London Borough of Havering) will attract a liability payment of £4,250 plus indexation in Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This charge has been levied under s.206 of the Planning Act 2008 and includes both the Mayor of London's CIL and Havering Council's CIL.",
    "London Borough of Havering, as CIL collecting authority, has responsibility for the collection of the Mayoral CIL, in addition to Havering's CIL, on commencement of the development.",
    "The proposed extensions would be less than 100 square metres and therefore the Mayoral CIL is not applicable.",
    "Your proposal is subject to a CIL Liability Notice indicating a levy £4250 plus indexation for the application, based on the Havering's charging rate for residential of £125/sq.m (Zone A), and the floorspace of 34 square m"
