    "The proposed dormer would, by reason of its design and excessive bulk appear out of scale and character with the existing dwelling. It would appear as a visually intrusive form of development from the perspective of neighbours rear gardens materially harmful to the character of the host dwelling and the surrounding area and harmful to the amenity of adjacent occupiers contrary to Policies 7 & 26 of the Havering Local Plan and the Council's Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD (2011).",
    "The proposed dual hip-to-gable loft conversion, by reason of its design and bulk would mean the subject dwelling would appear incongruous in the street scene inconsistent with the established hipped roof form of neighbouring dwellings contrary to Policies 7 & 26 of the Havering Local Plan and the Council's Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD (2011).",
    "The proposed development would, by reason of its position and proximity along the common boundary to No. 4 Ardleigh Close significantly reduce the availability of light into a habitable room window along the adjacent flank wall which would have a serious and adverse effect on the living conditions of adjacent occupiers of this property contrary to Policy 7 of the Havering Local Plan and the Council's Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: In accordance with paragraph 38 of the National Planning Policy Framework, improvements required to make the proposal acceptable were negotiated with the agent via email on 02/02/2024.  The revisions involved removing the loft conversion, roof gabling and rear dormer from the scheme. The applicant declined to make the suggested revisions."
