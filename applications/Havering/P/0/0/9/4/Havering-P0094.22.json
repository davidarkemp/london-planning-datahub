    "To comply with the requirements of Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended by Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004).",
    "Notwithstanding the details shown on the approved plans, the maximum projection of the front porch hereby approved shall not exceed 1.2 metres from the forward most part of the front elevation as shown in the proposed floor plan and south elevation. In all other respects, the development hereby permitted shall not be carried out otherwise than in complete accordance with the approved plans (as set out on page one of this decision notice).",

    "All new external finishes shall be carried out in materials to match those of the existing building(s) to the satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To safeguard the appearance of the premises and the character of the immediate area.",
    "The roof area of the extension hereby permitted shall not be used as a balcony, roof garden or similar amenity area without the grant of further specific permission from the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:-",
    "In the interests of the amenity of the occupiers of neighbouring dwelling.",

    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: In accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework 2019, improvements required to make the proposal acceptable were negotiated with the agent Greg Nichols by email. The revisions involved reducing the depth of the proposed front porch from 1.6m to 1.2m,  installing privacy screening to mitigate overlooking to the attached neighbour and removal of the parapet wall. The amendments were subsequently agreed and submitted on 09/03/2022 and 21/03/2022."
