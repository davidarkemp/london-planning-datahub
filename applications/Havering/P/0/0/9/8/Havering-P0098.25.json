    "The proposed development would, by reason of its cramped layout and proportions within the narrow plot and resultant excessive scale, bulk and height appear as an unduly prominent and visually intrusive feature in the streetscene harmful to the appearance of the surrounding area, contrary to the NPPF, Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021) and Policy 26 of the Havering Local Plan (2016).",
    "The proposed dwelling would, by reason of its size and design would result in an unsatisfactory relationship with the host dwelling of No.50 Rainsford Way, creating an unsymmetrical and unbalanced pair of dwellings and would be a negative addition to the streetscene, contrary to the NPPF and Policy 26 of the Havering Local Plan (2016).",
    "The proposed parking provision would, by reason of its siting and proximity to the street lamppost on Strathmore Garden, fails to ensure safe vehicle access and manoeuvrability, resulting to adverse impact on parking and highway safety, contrary to paragraph 117 of the NPPF (2024), Policy T4 the London Plan (2021) and Policy 23 of the Havering Local Plan (2016).",
    "The proposal, if granted planning permission on appeal, would be liable for a Mayoral",
    "and Havering Community Infrastructure Levy payment as it would create one additional",
    "residential unit and would add a net additional 79.8sqm of residential floor space.",
    "Based upon the information supplied with the application, the Mayoral CIL payable would be £1,995 based on the calculation of £25.00 per square metre and the Havering Community Infrastructure Levy (HCIL) would be a charge of £9,975 based on calculation of £125 per square metre. Each would be subject to indexation.",
