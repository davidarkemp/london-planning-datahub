  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed subdivision would not provide a satisfactory standard of accommodation for future occupiers and would therefore be in conflict with Policy 3.5 of the London Plan by providing insufficient internal space, and Policy DC4 Conversions to Residential and Subdivision of Residential Uses of the 2008 Havering Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan because there would not be reasonable outlook and aspect and Policy DC61 Urban Design of the Development Plan and its Residential Design Supplementary Planning Document 2010 by failing to complement or improve local amenity with respect to the proposed development.",
    "The proposed alterations required to facilitate the subdivision of the existing property involve the formation of a hip-to-gable loft conversion and rear dormer. The proposals would unbalance the existing pair of semi-detached dwellings to the detriment of the character of the subject premises and the surrounding context. Furthermore the rear dormer window would be over excessive size, lacking subservience and at odds with the guidance contained within the Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD. The proposals are therefore considered cumulatively to be contrary to Policy DC61 and also the guidance contained within the Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to the agent in writing 16-03-2020.",
    "The proposal, if granted planning permission on appeal, would be liable for the Mayor of London Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and Havering's CIL. Based upon the information supplied with the application, the CIL payable would be Â£5034. Further details with regard to CIL are available from the Council's website."
