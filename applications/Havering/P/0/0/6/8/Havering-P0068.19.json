    "The rear extensions would, by reason of their excessive scale, siting and position close to the boundary shared with No. 69 Bruce Avenue and proposed north west facing window, be unneighbourly which would give rise to an uncomfortable overbearing effect and sense of enclosure, loss of outlook, loss of privacy and be harmful to the amenity of No. 69 Bruce Avenue contrary to policy DC61 of the Adopted Havering Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD 2008 and the Adopted Havering Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD 2011",
