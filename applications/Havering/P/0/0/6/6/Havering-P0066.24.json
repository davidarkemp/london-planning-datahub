    "Reason:-",
    "This use only is permitted and other uses, either within the same Use Class, or permitted by the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 are not acceptable to the Local Planning Authority in this location because of its location.",
    "Prior to the first occupation of the development hereby approved, the proposed fences, gates and walls shall be carried out in accordance with the approved plans and retained permanently thereafter to the satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:",
    "In order to protect the visual amenities of the development and prevent undue overlooking of adjoining property.",

Where any installations do not meet this emissions standard it should not be operated without the fitting of suitable NOx abatement equipment or technology as determined by a specialist to ensure comparable emissions. The installation of the boilers shall be carried out in strict accordance with these details and shall thereafter be permanently retained.",
    "Reason: To minimise the impact of building emissions on local air quality.",
    "Prior to the first occupation of the development hereby approved, the residential parking space(s) shall be provided with active vehicle charging facilities for electric or Ultra-Low Emission vehicles.",
    "Reason:  Provision prior to first occupation of the proposed dwellings hereby permitted will ensure that the development adequately incorporates measures to allow the use of electric vehicles by future occupiers in accordance with Policy T6.1 of the London Plan.",
    "Notwithstanding the provisions of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015, no extension or enlargement (including additions to roofs) shall be made to the dwellinghouse(s) hereby permitted, or any detached building erected, without the express permission in writing of the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:-",
    "In the interests of amenity and to enable the Local Planning Authority to retain control over future development.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: In accordance with paragraph 38 of the National Planning Policy Framework, improvements required to make the proposal acceptable were negotiated with the agent Mr. Julian Williams, via emails and telephone calls at various times. The revisions involved providing adequate justification for the loss of social infrastructure and amended layout. The justification and amended plans were all received on 10/07/2024.",
