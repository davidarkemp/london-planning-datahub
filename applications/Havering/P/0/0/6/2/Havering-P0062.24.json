    "The proposed vehicular crossover and driveway to the front of the site would, by reason of its proximity close to the nearby junction, result in an unsatisfactory parking arrangement which would be detrimental to safety of pedestrians and other road users as it would unacceptably increase the risk of hazards to highways safety, contrary to London Plan Policies T4 and T6, the Havering Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD and Domestic Vehicle Dropped Kerb Policy April 2023.",
    "The proposed vehicular crossover would, by reason of its positioning result in an encroachment onto the highway land with the loss of a section of pedestrian walkway along Havering Road/Campbell Close. Given the close proximity in which the pedestrian walkway is located near the juction it would be likely to make the public highway a more dangerous environment than the existing highway arrangement contrary to Policies 7 and 23 of the Havering Local Plan."
