    "The development to which this permission relates must be commenced not later than three years from the date of this permission.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To comply with the requirements of Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended by Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004).",
    "All new external finishes shall be carried out in materials to match those of the existing building(s) to the satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To safeguard the appearance of the premises and the character of the immediate area, and in order that the development accords with the Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policy DC61.",
    "The development hereby permitted shall not be carried out otherwise than in complete accordance with the approved plans (as set out on page one of this decision notice).",
    "Reason:-",
    "For the avoidance of doubt and to ensure that the development is carried out as approved.",
    "The extension hereby permitted shall be used only for living accommodation as an integral part of the existing dwelling known as 55 Masefield Crescent, Romford and shall not be used as a separate unit of residential accommodation at any time.",
    "Reason: The site is within an area where the Local Planning Authority considers that the sub-division of existing properties should not be permitted in the interests of amenity, and that the development accords with Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policy DC61.",
    "Notwithstanding the provisions of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015, Article 3, Schedule 2, Part 2, Class A the front and rear gardens shall not be subdivided and no gates, walls or enclosures shall be erected or constructed within the existing boundaries of the site as indicated by red line on the approved Proposed Block PLan & Site Location Plan drawing number 3 unless permission under the provisions of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 has first been sought and obtained in writing from the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason: In order that the extension approved remains ancillary to the main dwelling and that the development accords with Policy DC61 of the Development Control Policies Development Plan Document",
    "Notwithstanding the provisions of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (or any order revoking, re-enacting or modifying that Order), no windows or doors other than those expressly authorised by this permission shall be constructed in the flank or front elevations of the extension hereby permitted.",
    "Reason: The site is within an area where the Local Planning Authority considers that the sub-division of existing properties should not be permitted in the interests of amenity, and so that the development accords with Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policy DC61.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35(2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management) Order 2015: No significant problems were identified during the consideration of the application, and therefore it has been determined in accordance with paragraph 38 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2018."
