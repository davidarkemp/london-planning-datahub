    "The proposed development, would by reason of its bulk, mass and siting, represent an overdevelopment of the rear garden environment which is inconsistent with the prevailing open character of the rear garden scene and pattern of development and also result in insufficient onsite parking and an unacceptable increase for parking on the highway, contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD.",
    "The proposed development, which would function as two additional self-contained residential units in the rear garden scene, would result in an unprecedented and unacceptable impact to amenity, including overlooking and loss of privacy for surrounding residents and future tenants of the property contrary to DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD and the Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD.",
