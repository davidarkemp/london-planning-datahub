    "The proposed dwelling would, by reason of its siting, layout, design and configuration would fail to provide adequate outlook for the proposed habitable rooms. Further it would be likely that the prosed dwelling would not be likely to receive adequate daylight or sun light due to high boundary walls surrounding the proposed dwelling. Similarly the proposed amenity space would be surrounded by high walls, there by failing to provide an acceptable amenity space provision for the enjoyment of the future residents. The main access to the proposed dwelling would be via a poor environment of the service road which would not be readily used late in the evening due to fear of crime. Overall it is considered that the proposal would provide a poor quality accommodation for the future occupiers of the site, contrary to Policy 7 of the Havering Local Plan and Policy D6 of the London Plan.",
    "The proposed development would result in loss of car parking provision without an adequate replacement. Further there is no undertaking to ensure the future occupiers of the site would be exempt from parking within the over subscribed residential parking zone. The proposal would therefore, result in unacceptable overspill onto the adjoining roads to the detriment road safety condition and the free flow of traffic contrary to Policy 24 of Local Plan.",
    "There appears to be no provision for cycle storage for the proposed dwelling. The proposal would also result in the loss of space for the refuse, recycling and cycle storage for the  existing flat and the commercial user of the sites, thereby having adverse impact upon amenities of the existing occupiers of the site, therefore it is considered that the proposed development would be contrary to Policies 24 and 35 of the Havering Local Plan.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to the agent via email.",
    "For Residential Development Only",
    "Please be advised that approval of this application from 1st September 2019 (either by London Borough of Havering, or subsequently by PINS if allowed on appeal following a refusal by London Borough of Havering) will attract a liability payment of £6,125 plus indexation in Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This charge has been levied under s.206 of the Planning Act 2008 and includes both the Mayor of London's CIL and Havering Council's CIL.",
    "London Borough of Havering, as CIL collecting authority, has responsibility for the collection of the Mayoral CIL, in addition to Havering's CIL, on commencement of the development.",
    "Your proposal is subject to a CIL Liability Notice indicating a levy of £1,225 plus indexation for the application, based on the Mayoral CIL levy rate for Havering of £25/sq.m plus Havering's charging rate for residential of £125/sq.m (Zone A).",
