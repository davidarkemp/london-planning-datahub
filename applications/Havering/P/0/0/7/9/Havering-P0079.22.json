  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed dwelling would give rise to a cramped form of development, on an uncharacteristically small plot, giving rise to garden sizes which are materially out of keeping with that prevailing in the locality and resulting in an intrusive and overbearing form of development when seen from the streetscene and the wider rear garden environment, harmful to local character and contrary to Policy D6 of the London Plan (adopted 2021).",
    "The proposed dwelling would, by reason of its detached nature and proximity close to the shared boundaries either side of the site, appear as an unacceptably dominant and visually intrusive feature in the streetscene, harmful to the established local pattern of development and closing down the characteristic gap between end-terraced and semi-detached properties within the surrounding area. It would therefore be harmful to the character and appearance of the surrounding area contrary to Local Plan Policies 7 and 26.",
    "The proposed development would, by reason of its scale, bulk and mass, position close to the boundaries of the site and position of upper floor windows, give rise to an intrusive and unneighbourly form of development, resulting in harm to the privacy and amenity of occupiers of neighbouring property at nos. 1 and 3 Hood Walk, contrary to the provisions of Local Plan Policy 7 and 10..",
    "The proposed development would, by reason of the low ceiling heights and absence of designated internal storage, result in a low quality design that would be to the detriment of future occupants, contrary to the provisions of Policy D6 of the London Plan (adopted 2021).",
    "In the event that this application is allowed through the appeals process the proposals would be liable for the following CIL contributions:",
    "Mayoral CIL (MCIL2) contribution of £1,755 (x £25 per sqm).",
    "Havering CIL (HCIL) contribution of £8,875 (x £125 per sqm)",
    "Each contribution would be subject to indexation.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal was given to the agent via email on 15 March 2022."
