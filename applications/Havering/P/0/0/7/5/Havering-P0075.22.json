    "The proposed loft conversion including the hip to gable roof conversion and rear dormer window would further unbalance the appearance of the pair of semi-detached properties and appear as an unacceptably dominant and visually intrusive feature in the street scene harmful to the appearance of the surrounding area, contrary to Policy 7 and 26 of the Havering Local Plan 2021, the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document and Policy D1 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "The proposed rear dormer window, by reason of its scale, bulk and mass would appear out of scale and character with the dwelling and materially harmful to the character of the surrounding area contrary to Policy 7 and 26 of the Havering Local Plan 2021, the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document and Policy D1 of the London Plan 2021.",
