    "The proposed two storey rear extension, by reason of its height, excessive depth and position close to the boundaries of the site, would be an intrusive and unneighbourly form of development that would have an adverse effect on the amenity of the adjacent occupiers at nos. 99 and 95 Elmhurst Drive, Hornchurch, contrary to Local Plan Policy 7 and the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy a decision was made on the application, which will enable the applicant to exercise a right of appeal if they so wish."
