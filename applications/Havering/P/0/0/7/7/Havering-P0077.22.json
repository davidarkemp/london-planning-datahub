    "The proposed extension would, by reason of its excessive depth and position close to the boundary of the site, be an intrusive and unneighbourly development having an overbearing impact, resulting in a significant loss of outlook and an increased sense of enclosure detrimental to the amenities of the adjacent occupiers at no. 145 Cranham Gardens, contrary to Policy 7 of the Local Plan and the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document.",
