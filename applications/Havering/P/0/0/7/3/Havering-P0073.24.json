    "The proposed dwelling would, by reason of its set back from the front building line, roof form and architectural design, appear out of character with the established design of surrounding dwellings within the street scene and result in an uncharacteristically small rear garden area for the donor property no. 36 Hawthorn Avenue, contrary to Policies 7, 10 and 26 of the Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 as well as Paragraph 135(d) of the NPPF which requires fundamentally that development add to the overall quality of the area whilst also establishing or maintaining a strong sense of place.",
    "The proposed development would, by reason of its limited floor to ceiling heights, lack of storage space and small rear amenity area, result in a low quality design that would be to the detriment of future occupants. The proposed dwelling's set back from the front building line would also result in it failing to provide access through a convenient route meaning that overall, the proposal would be contrary to the provisions of Policies D5 and D6 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies 7 and 10 of the Havering Local Plan 2016-2031.",
    "The proposed dwelling, by reason of its projection beyond the rear of the donor property no. 36 Hawthorn Avenue, would form a visually intrusive and overbearing feature that would be detrimental to the amenity of these neighbouring occupants and would therefore be contrary to Policies 7, 10 and 26 of the Havering Local Plan 2016-2031. There would also be conflict with paragraph 135(f) of the National Planning Policy Framework which seeks to ensure a high standard of amenity for existing and future occupiers.",
    "The proposed development would fail to provide any car parking spaces, contrary to the provisions of Local Plan Policy 24.",
    "In the event that this application is allowed through the appeals process, the proposals would be liable for the following CIL contributions:",
    "Mayoral CIL (MCIL2) contribution of £1,775 (x £25 per sqm).",
    "Havering CIL (HCIL) contribution of £8,875 (x £125 per sqm)",
    "Each contribution would be subject to indexation.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal was given to the agent via email on 22/04/2024."
