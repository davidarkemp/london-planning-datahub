  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed development would result in living conditions that do not create a suitably high quality living environment for future occupiers, in particular accommodation at first floor level which would fail to align with prescribed minimum internal spacing standards and would also not demonstrate any form of amenity space. The constraints of the site in conjunction with the number of units proposed, internal arrangement and provision of amenity space would contribute to an environment which would be detrimental to the amenity of future occupants in direct contrast to the aims of London Plan Policy 3.5, Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD and the provisions of the National Planning Policy Framework.",
    "The internal layout of the proposals is such that bedrooms would abut primary habitable rooms of the attached property which would harmful to the amenity of occupiers of that premises. The proposals are therefore contrary to Policy DC4, Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD, the Residential Design SPD and Policy 3.5 of The London Plan and the provisions of the National Planning Policy Framework.",
