    "The proposed development, which could function as a self-contained 2-bedroom residential unit in the rear garden scene, would result in an unprecedented and unacceptable impact on visual amenity, including additional comings and goings, noise and disturbance associated with the use and would be out of character with site and surrounding areas, contrary to Policies 7 and 26 of the Havering Local Plan 2021 and the Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD.",
    "The proposed development by reason of its large footprint would be inconsistent with the prevailing open character of the rear garden scene and pattern of development within the street scene to the rear, contrary to Policy 26 of the Local Plan 2021 and the Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD (2011).",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, it was necessary to issue a decision as close to the statutory timeframe as possible as opposed to seeking amendments which would have significantly delayed the application."
