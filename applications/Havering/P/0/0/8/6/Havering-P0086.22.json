  "description": "Two storey side extension to create attached annexe",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The development to which this permission relates must be commenced not later than three years from the date of this permission.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To comply with the requirements of Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended by Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004).",
    "The development hereby permitted shall not be carried out otherwise than in complete accordance with the approved plans (as set out on page one of this decision notice).",
    "Reason:-",
    "For the avoidance of doubt and to ensure that the development is carried out as approved.",
    "All new external finishes shall be carried out in materials to match those of the existing building(s) to the satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To safeguard the appearance of the premises and the character of the immediate area.",
    "The proposed two storey side extension shall be used only for living accommodation as an integral part of the existing dwelling known as 25 Petworth Way and shall not be used as a separate unit of residential accommodation at any time.",
    "Reason:-",
    "The site is within an area where the Local Planning Authority consider that the sub-division of existing properties should not be permitted in the interests of amenity, and that the development accords with the Local Plan Policy 7.",
    "Prior to the commencement of any further groundworks or development of the site, details shall be submitted to and agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority setting out suitable gas protection measures to be employed on site including, but not necessarily limited to, the installation of a suitable gas resistant membrane. The gas protection measures shall be carried out in strict accordance with the agreed details. Upon completion of installation, a 'Verification Report' must be submitted demonstrating that the works have been carried out.",
    "Reason:-",
    "Insufficient information has been submitted to ensure that the occupants of the development and property are not subject to any risks from soil gas and/or vapour.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35(2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management) Order 2015: No significant problems were identified during the consideration of the application, and therefore it has been determined in accordance with paragraph 38 of the National Planning Policy Framework."
