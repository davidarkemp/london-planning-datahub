    "The proposal would harm the living conditions of the occupiers of No. 60 in respect of privacy, and the location of the refuse collection point without details of the design and management strategy, would result in significant odour nuisance to the adjacent properties (nos. 60 and 62). In addition, by reason of the proximity of the access way to the adjacent properties with likely increase in vehicle movements, would create unacceptable level of noise and disturbance to the properties either sides, which would adversely impact on their living conditions, contrary to Policy 7 of the Local Plan.",
    "The application fails to demonstrate that the proposal, having regard to the in/out access system with the potential increase in vehicle movements to and from the site, would not result in conflict, with the need for vehicles to reverse onto Carlton Road or larger vehicles attempting to access site, resulting in pedestrian and highway safety concerns, contrary to policies 23 and 24 of the Local Plan 2021.",
    "The proposed development, in the absence of a noise report and mitigation measures, it cannot be confirmed that there will not be adverse impact on future occupiers from railway noise, contrary to the aims and objectives of London Plan Policy D6 and Policy 26 of the Local Plan 2021.",
    "In the absence of a full Tree Survey, the proposed development would result in the removal and/or harm to trees on/adjacent site, which would be materially harmful to the character and amenity of site and surrounding area, contrary to Policies 27 of the Local Plan and the NPPF 2024.",
    "In the absence of the required BNG information, the proposals has failed to demonstrate its compliance with its biodiversity duties under s.4 NERC Act 2006 (as amended) and Policy 30 of the Local Plan 2021.",
    "The proposal, if granted planning permission on appeal, would be liable for both the Mayor of London Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and the Havering Council's Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) . Based upon the information supplied with the application, the CIL payable would be a total £51,300.00. Further details with regard to CIL are available from the Council's website.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, it was necessary to issue a decision as close to the statutory timeframe as possible as opposed to seeking amendments which would have significantly delayed the application."
