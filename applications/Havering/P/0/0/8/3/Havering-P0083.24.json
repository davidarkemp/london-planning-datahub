    "The exsiting boundary treatment, by reason of its excessive height, scale and poor design would introduce a design element which is inconsistent with the established low rise form of development to boundaries of properties in the street scene. This would add a design element which is incongruous with other properties along Nelmes Crescent to the detriment of the visual amenity of the locality contrary to Policies 7 and 26 of the Havering Local Plan and the Council's Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD.",
    "The existing boundary treatment, by reason of its excessive height fails to provide adequate levels of visibility for vehicles when they egress from the site which has created an unsafe environment for pedestrians and other vehicles contrary to Policy 7 of the Local Plan.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to Mr James Collinson (Agent) by e-mail on 12/03/24."
