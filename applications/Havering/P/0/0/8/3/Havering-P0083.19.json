    "The proposal would, by reason of insufficient provision of amenity space for the occupants of each of the residential units, the failure to provide adequate levels of light and outlook to habitable rooms within the ground floor flat and the adverse noise and disturbance impacts which would be experienced by the occupants of the proposed ground floor unit, result in poor quality residential units, to the detriment of the living conditions of potential occupiers. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy 3.5 of The London Plan, Policies DC4 and DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD.",
