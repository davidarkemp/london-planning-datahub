  "description": "Retrospective Change of use from Use Class C3 (Dwellinghouse) to Use Class C4 (Houses in multiple occupation)",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposal, by reason of the cramped internal layout and intensification of the existing residential use, would fail to create a high quality living environment for future occupiers and would instead represent a limited and poor quality standard of accommodation. As a result the proposal would not provide acceptable living conditions for all of the future occupants, to the detriment of residential amenity and in direct contrast to the aims of London Plan Policy 3.5 and Policies CP17, DC3, DC4, DC5, DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD.",
    "The proposed development would, by reason of the inadequate on site car parking provision, result in unacceptable overspill onto the adjoining roads to the detriment of highway safety. The increased competition for spaces would be of detriment to the amenity of surrounding residential occupiers and the proposals are therefore contrary to Policy DC32, DC33 and DC35 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD.",
    "The proposal, by reason of the increased amounts of activity within the building and outdoor areas, together with an intensification of the residential use in such close proximity to the neighbouring properties would result in unacceptable levels of noise and disturbance to the detriment of residential amenity. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy DC61 of the Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to the agent Mr Andrews by email dated 13 March 2020."
