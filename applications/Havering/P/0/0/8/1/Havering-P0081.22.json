  "decision_conditions": [
    "The site is within the area identified in the Havering Local Plan as Metropolitan Green Belt.  The Havering Local Plan and Government Guidance as set out in the NPPF is that in order to achieve the purposes of the Metropolitan Green Belt it is essential to retain and protect the existing rural character of the area so allocated and that new development will only be permitted outside the existing built up areas in the most exceptional circumstances. The proposed dwelling by reason of its impact on openness, is considered to be inappropriate development and as such would be harmful to the Green Belt. The proposals therefore fail to comply with the NPPF, in particular paragraph 149 and is also contrary to Policy G2 of the London Plan and the overall aims of the Havering Local Plan.",
    "The proposal, due to the limited space available to the proposed and donor dwelling, would result in vehicles entering/leaving the site in reverse gear which is considered to be inadequate for this purpose and would be detrimental to the safety of other road users contrary to Paragraph 111 of the NPPF andf Policy 23 of the Havering Local Plan (2016-2031)",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to Mr A Pantazis (agent) by email on 29/03/22.",
    "The proposal, if granted planning permission on appeal, would be liable for the Mayor of London and Havering Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). Based upon the information supplied with the application, the Mayoral CIL payable would be £2,100 based on the calculation of ?£25.00 per square metre and the Havering Community Infrastructure Levy (HCIL) would be a charge of £10,500 based on calculation of £125 per square metre. Each would be subject to indexation.",
    "Further details with regard to CIL are available from the Council's website."
