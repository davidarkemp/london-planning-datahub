    "The proposed dormer on this prominent location and highly visible from the street scene would appear uncharacteristic for the street scene and surrounding area and would adversely impact the character and appearance of the locality and the established pattern of development, contrary to the high-quality design aspirations of National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policies D3 and D4 of The London Plan (2021) and Policies 7 and 26 of the Local Plan.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to Mr A Gunn (agent) by email dated 16/03/23.",
    "The proposal, if granted planning permission on appeal, would be liable for the Mayor of London and Havering Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). Based upon the information supplied with the application, the Mayoral CIL payable would be £3050 based on the calculation of £25 per square metre and the Havering Community Infrastructure Levy (HCIL) would be a charge of £15,342 based on calculation of £125.76 per square metre. Each would be subject to indexation.",
