    "The proposed development represents inappropriate development in the Green Belt and would by reason of its siting and height, appear intrusive and visually dominant and significantly harm the openness and undermine the purposes for which the land was designated.  Very special circumstances that clearly outweigh the harm, by reason of inappropriateness and other harm, do not clearly outweigh the inappropriateness and harm caused to the Metropolitan Green Belt.",
    "The proposal is contrary to Policy DC45 of the London Borough of Havering's Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document 2008, Policy 7.16 of the London Plan 2016 and Government guidance contained within the National Planning Policy Framework 2019.",
    "The proposed development, by reason of its height and siting, combined with the change in ground levels, would appear dominant and visually intrusive in the rear garden environment harmful to the amenity of adjacent occupiers, particularly No.'s 40-48 Priory Road contrary to Policies DC61 and DC64 of the London Borough of Havering's Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document 2008 and Government guidance contained within the National Planning Policy Framework 2019.",
