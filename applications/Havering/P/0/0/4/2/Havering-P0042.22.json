  "decision_conditions": [
    "The development to which this permission relates must be commenced not later than three years from the date of this permission.",

    "Reason:-",
    "To safeguard the appearance of the premises and the character of the immediate area.",
    "The development hereby permitted shall not be carried out otherwise than in complete accordance with the approved plans (as set out on page one of this decision notice).",
    "Reason:-",
    "For the avoidance of doubt and to ensure that the development is carried out as approved.",
    "A 2 metre high close boarded fence adjacent to the existing dwelling and the proposed ground floor rear extension along the northern boundary of the site adjacent to the properties along Nelmes Crescent, Hornchurch shall be erected and permanently retained and maintained thereafter.",
    "Reason:-",
    "In the interests of privacy.",
    "The proposed rooflights serving the bathrooms on the north and south roof slopes shall be permanently glazed with obscure glass not less than level 4 on the standard scale of obscurity and shall thereafter be maintained as such.",

    "Reason:-",
    "In order to ensure a satisfactory development that will not result in any loss of privacy or damage to the environment of neighbouring properties which exist or may be proposed in the future.",
    "The roof area of the extension hereby permitted shall not be used as a balcony, roof garden or similar amenity area without the grant of further specific permission from the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:-",
    "In the interests of the amenity of the occupiers of neighbouring dwelling.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35(2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management) Order 2015: No significant problems were identified during the consideration of the application, and therefore it has been determined in accordance with paragraph 38 of the National Planning Policy Framework."
