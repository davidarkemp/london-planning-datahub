    "The proposal would not comply with the objectives of Policy 9 of the Havering Local Plan 2021, especially subsections (ii) and (iii) through having limited internal floor area of less than 120 sq.m in the original dwelling, and the absence of a suitable and functional family sized unit at the ground floor level. In failing to align with the objectives of this policy there would also be conflict with Policies 3 and 5 of the Local Plan through loss of the existing family dwelling house and the lack of a suitably designed family home.",
    "The proposed layout of the living area at the first floor next to a bedroom area of the adjoining dwelling no.60 Burlington Avenue, as well as the 3-bedroom unit not being appropriately located on the ground floor (with only a poor, unpractical narrow corridor on the ground floor) and a convoluted layout as well as the unpractical functionality of the rear garden, without the boundary treatment of individual garden areas would give rise to a poor quality living environment for future occupiers of the flat and the occupiers of the adjoining dwelling at no.60 Burlington Avenue, contrary to Policy 7 and 9 of the Havering Local Plan 2021 and Policy D6 of the London Plan.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, it was necessary to issue a decision as close to the statutory timeframe as possible as opposed to seeking amendments which would have significantly delayed the application."
