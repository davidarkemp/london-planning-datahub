    "The proposed development would, by reason of its excessive depth, height and position close to the boundaries of the site, be an intrusive and unneighbourly development as well as having an adverse effect on the amenities of adjacent occupiers contrary to Policy DC61 of the London Borough of Havering's LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD 2008.",
    "In the absence of a legal agreement to secure contributions towards the demand for school places arising from the development, the proposal fails to satisfactorily mitigate the infrastructure impact of the development, contrary to the provisions of Policies DC29 and DC72 of the London Borough of Havering's Development Control Policies DPD 2008 and Policy 8.2 of the London Plan 2016.",
    "The proposal, if granted planning permission on appeal, would be liable for the Mayor of London Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). Based upon the information supplied with the application, the CIL payable would be Â£8,480. Further details with regard to CIL are available from the Council's website.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to Andrew Cooke via email on 7th March 2019."
