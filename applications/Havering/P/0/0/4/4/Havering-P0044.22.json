    "The proposed rear extension would, by reason of its excessive depth and position close to the boundary of the site, be an intrusive and unneighbourly development having an overbearing impact, resulting in a significant loss of outlook and an increased sense of enclosure detrimental to the amenities of the adjacent occupiers at No. 143 Cranham Gardens contrary to Policy 7 of the Local Plan and the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to Mr John Wallington-Smith via telephone and email on the 28/02/22 and 1 March 2022 respectively."
