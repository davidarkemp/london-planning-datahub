    "The proposed development of the part single storey and part two storey rear extension would by reason of it having an excessive depth, appear as an unacceptably dominant, incongruous and visually intrusive feature in the rear garden scene that would be out of character and harmful to the appearance of the semi-detached pair and the surrounding area contrary to Havering's Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD (adopted 2011) and Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD.",
