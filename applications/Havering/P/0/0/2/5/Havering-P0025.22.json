    "The proposed development, having regards to the cumulative scale, width, bulk and mass of the hip to gable roof alterations, raising of the ridge and front dormer windows, would fail to satisfactorily integrate with the original design of the building and would be out of scale and character with the host dwelling and the immediate surrounding area. As such, the proposals are contrary to Policy 7 of the Local Plan and the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Improvements to the proposal to reduce the width of the proposed rear dormer of the building were negotiated with the agent during the course of the application. However, the proposed developments were considered at detailed assessment stage to still be unacceptable. Further significant alteration would have been required to bring the development within the realms of acceptability so it was decided to proceed to determine the application."
