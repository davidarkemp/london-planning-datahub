    "Overall, the proposal would introduce an intrusive feature which would detract from the character and appearance of the area, contribute to visual clutter and would not preserve the setting of the Listed Building and the character and appearance of the Romford Conservation Area, contrary to Policies 26 and 28 of the adopted Havering Local Plan.  Sections 66 and 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 are relevant.  With regards to the NPPF, less than substantial harm to the significance of the relevant heritage assets is envisaged, and paragraphs 213 and 215 are relevant.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, it was necessary to issue a decision as close to the statutory timeframe as possible as opposed to seeking amendments which would have significantly delayed the application."
