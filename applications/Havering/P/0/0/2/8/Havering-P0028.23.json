    "The side/rear extension, by reason of its excessive depth on the shared boundary, is considered to be an intrusive and unneighbourly development that has an adverse effect on the amenity of the adjacent occupiers at No. 262 Mungo Park Road, contrary to Local Plan Policy 7 and the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document.",

This planning permission does not assess or authorise the use of the building overall, or any of the individual rooms in the property, nor the layout of the building as shown in the drawings submitted with the application."
