    "The proposed dwelling through its design, mass, projection forward of the building line and site layout would form an incongruous and visually cramped form of development at odds with the surrounding character and detrimental to the visual amenity of the locality. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policies 7, 10 and 26 of the Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 and also Paragraph 130(a) of the NPPF which requires fundamentally that development add to the overall quality of the area whilst also establishing or maintaining a strong sense of place.",
    "There are two car parking spaces proposed for the new dwelling, which exceeds the maximum car parking provision of up to one space contrary to the aim of the Mayor to reduce car use and contrary to Policy T6.1 of the London Plan.",
    "The siting and layout of the parking spaces for the dwelling with limited turning space and the lack of visibility splays, result in inadequate access and egress arrangements and could lead to hazardous manoeuvring harmful to highway and pedestrian safety and the amenity of future occupiers contrary to Policies 10, 23 and 24 of the Havering Local Plan and Policy T4 of the London Plan.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to EK Architects (Agent) by e-mail on 26/03/25.",

    "Please be advised that approval of this application from 1st September 2019 (either by London Borough of Havering, or subsequently by PINS if allowed on appeal following a refusal by London Borough of Havering) will attract a liability payment of £12,000 plus indexation in Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This charge has been levied under s.206 of the Planning Act 2008 and includes both the Mayor of London's CIL and Havering Council's CIL.",
    "London Borough of Havering, as CIL collecting authority, has responsibility for the collection of the Mayoral CIL, in addition to Havering's CIL, on commencement of the development.",
    "Your proposal is subject to a CIL Liability Notice indicating a levy of £12,000 plus indexation for the application, based on the Mayoral CIL levy rate for Havering of £25/sq.m plus Havering's charging rate for residential of £125/sq.m (Zone A), and the floorspace of 80 square metres.",
