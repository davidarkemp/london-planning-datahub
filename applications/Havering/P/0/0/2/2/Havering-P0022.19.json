    "No evidence has been provided to support the need for a community facility in this location. The lack of accessibility also suggests an unsuitable development in this location. In light of the above, the proposed change of use is contrary to Policy DC26 of the Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document.",
    "The proposal would, by reason of noise and disturbance caused by the intensification of the property be unacceptably detrimental to the amenities of occupiers of adjacent properties, contrary to Policy DC55 and DC61 of the Local Development Framework Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document and the NPPF.",
    "The proposed change of use would,  result in an unsatisfactory relationship by way of noise and disturbance which would detrimentally impact upon the amenity and living conditions of future occupiers and result in a more intensive use of the premises. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies DC4, DC5 and DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD.",
    "The level of parking provided is insufficient for a day-care facility of this size and in this location and is contrary to Policy DC5 (Specialist Accommodation) of the Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document. The proposed change of use would, by reason of the inadequate on site car parking provision, is expected to result in unacceptable overspill onto the adjoining roads to the detriment of highway safety and residential amenity, and is therefore contrary to Policies DC61, DC32 and DC33 of the Core Strategy.",
