    "It is considered that the garden fencing, by reason of its height and length, appears as an incongruous and unduly prominent feature within in the rear garden scene, as well as being visually intrusive and thereby having an adverse effect on the  amenities  of the adjacent occupiers at no. 70 Central Drive, contrary to Local Plan Policy 7 and the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document.",
