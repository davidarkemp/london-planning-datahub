    "The proposed extensions to facilitate the proposals including the side extension with no setback from the main front building line, hip-to-gable roof extension with front and rear dormers in terms of its scale, massing, design and character would appear incongruous development to the existing host building, unbalance the appearance of this semi-detached pair and appear as an unacceptably dominant and visually intrusive feature in the street scene, rear gardens and the surrounding area. As such, the proposal is contrary to Policies 7 & 26 of the Havering Local Plan and the Council's Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD (2011).",
