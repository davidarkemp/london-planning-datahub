    "The proposed first floor side extension would, by reason of its height, scale, bulk and proximity to the neighbouring property no. 118 Beauly Way, be an  intrusive, overbearing and unneighbourly development that would have a significant adverse effect on light and outlook from the flank bedroom window of these adjacent occupiers, contrary to Policy 7 of the Havering Local Plan and the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Improvements to the proposal to reduce the depth of the proposed side extension were negotiated with the agent during the course of the application. However, its resultant impact on the amenity of the neighbouring property no. 118 Beauly Way was considered at detailed assessment stage to still be unacceptable.  Further significant alteration would have been required to bring the development within the realms of acceptability so it was decided to proceed to determine the application."
