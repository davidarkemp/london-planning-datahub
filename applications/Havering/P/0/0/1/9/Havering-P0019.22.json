    "The development to which this permission relates must be commenced not later than three years from the date of this permission.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To comply with the requirements of Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended by Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004).",
    "The development hereby permitted shall not be carried out otherwise than in complete accordance with the approved plans (as set out on page one of this decision notice).",
    "Reason:-",
    "For the avoidance of doubt and to ensure that the development is carried out as approved.",
    "The premises shall not be used for the purposes hereby permitted other than between the hours of :",
    "Mondays - Sundays - 09:00 and 23:00",
    "Bank or Public holidays - 09:00 and 23:00;",
    "without the prior consent in writing of the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To enable the Local Planning Authority to retain control in the interests of amenity.",
    "The noise mitigation methods recommended in the Noise Impact Assessment Report produced by KP Acoustics, dated 05 August 2022 submitted in support of this application shall be implemented prior to the hereby permitted use commencing.  Such scheme as approved shall be thereafter retained in accordance with such details.  Any variation to the scheme shall be agreed in writing with the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To prevent loss of amenity to neighbouring (residential) properties from noise",
    "A Dispersal Policy and Nuisance Management Plan (DPNMP), detailing measures to manage the noise and behaviour of patrons as they arrive, remain at and leave the venue shall be submitted to and agreed in writing with the Local Planning Authority and Police before the hereby permitted use commences.  The DPNMP will be a live document, subject to variation by the LPA and Police should substantiated complaints be received.  If at any time the requirements of the DPNMP shall not be complied with, or the relevant authorities withdraw their agreement,  the hereby permitted use shall cease.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To protect nearby noise sensitive premise from a loss of amenity due to noise from patrons.",
    "The proposed development shall achieve a Certificate of Compliance in respect of the Secured by Design scheme, to the satisfaction of the local authority & Metropolitan Police, details of which shall be provided to the Local Planning Authority for its written approval prior to the business opening of the approved development. All security measures applied to the approved development shall be permanently retained thereafter.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To ensure safe and secure development and reduce crime.",
    "The use of the development hereby approved shall not commenced until refuse and recycling facilities are provided in accordance with details which shall previously have been submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority. The refuse and recycling facilities shall be permanently retained thereafter.",
    "Reason:-",
    "Insufficient information has been supplied with the application to judge how refuse and recycling will be managed on site.  Submission of this detail prior to occupation in the case of new building works or prior to the use commencing in the case of changes of use will protect the amenity of occupiers of the development and also the locality generally.",
    "Notwithstanding the details shown on the approved plan, no timber screen shall be erected or other alterations made to the proposed entrance except in accordance with details, including detailed scaled elevations, that have previously been submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:-",
    "In order to protect the character and appearance of the site and surrounding area.",
    "This permission relates solely to the proposed event/banqueting venue at the third floor level and to no other development. Changes including new signage will require separate application.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: In accordance with paragraph 38 of the National Planning Policy Framework, improvements required to make the proposal acceptable were negotiated with agent (Mifta Ahmed & Rahima Siddika) via email/phone calls at various times. The revisions involved the provision of a noise report; confirmation of the number of users at one time and the update of the Design and Access Statement plus plans and changing the description of development. The final amendments/additional details were subsequently submitted on 27/01/2023."
