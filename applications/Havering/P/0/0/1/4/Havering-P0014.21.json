    "The proposed window replacement, by reason of their materiality, would materially and unacceptably detract from the character and appearance of the host property and adjoining terraces, to the detriment of the street-scene. The proposal to use UPVC on the front elevation of the building would neither preserve, nor enhance the special character of the Gidea Park Conservation Area and the proposal would not provide sufficient public benefits to outweigh this harm. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies DC61 and DC68 of the Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document and the NPPF.",
