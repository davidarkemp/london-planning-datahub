    "The drawings submitted with this application are inconsistent and misleading in that they show conflicting information regarding the proposed depth of the extension, such that the application cannot be properly considered and assessed.  Notwithstanding this, the rear extension would in any event, by reason of its scale, excessive depth and proximity to the neighbouring properties, be an intrusive, overbearing and unneighbourly development that would have a significant adverse effect on the amenities of the adjacent occupiers and be intrusive and overbearing in the rear garden environment contrary to Policy 7 of the Havering Local Plan and the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: In accordance with paragraph 38 of the National Planning Policy Framework, improvements required to make the proposal acceptable were communicated with the agent by email on 16.2.24.  The revisions involved a reduction in the depth to 3m.  The agent declined to make the suggested revisions. The agent was also advised that the plans were inconsistent and advised to withdraw the application but the request was refused."
