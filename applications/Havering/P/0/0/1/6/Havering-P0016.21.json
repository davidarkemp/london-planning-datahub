  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed extension, by reason of its bulk, height, lack of set back and close proximity to the common boundary with neighbour no295 would have a detrimental impact to the character and appearance of the host property, the streetscape and the visual amenity of the adjacent occupier at no.295. The proposals would be contrary to the NPPF, Policy D3 of The London Plan, Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD and the Council's Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD 2011.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: In accordance with paragraph 38 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2018, improvements required to make the proposal acceptable were negotiated with Mr P Gardner (agent) by email on 24/02/21.  The revisions involved setting back the proposal by 0.5m from the common boundary with neighbour no295.  The applicant declined to make the suggested revisions."
