    "The proposed development, by reason of its excessive size and bulk and proximity to the common boundary, would be visually obtrusive,  would unbalance the pair of semis, would enclose the characteristic gap between semi-detaching dwellings, would be out of character with neighbouring properties, and would not respect the scale and massing of those properties, to the detriment of the visual amenities of the neighbouring residents and the character of the area, contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD and the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document (Adopted 2011)",
    "The proposed development would, by reason of its position and proximity to neighbouring properties and overall bulk would cause overshadowing, loss of access to sunlight/ daylight and create a sense of enclosure and overbearing development, which would have a serious and adverse effect on the living conditions of adjacent occupiers at no. 148 Bevan Way, contrary to the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document (Adopted 2011) and Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to Mr Jack Dredge, via email on 20 March 2020."
