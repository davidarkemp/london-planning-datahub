    "The proposed development, in particular the part two storey rear extension (side dormer extension), but also in combination with the mass, form and height of extensions to the side of the property would, by reason of its roof form, design and having an excessive depth, appear as an unacceptably dominant, incongruous and visually intrusive feature in the streetscene and rear garden scene that would be out of character and harmful to the appearance of the semi-detached pair and the surrounding area contrary to the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document, policies D1, D3 and D4 of The London Plan (2021) and Policies 7 and 26 of the Local Plan.",
    "The proposed rear extensions would, by reason of its excessive depth, height and position close to the boundary of the site, be an intrusive and unneighbourly development as well as having an adverse effect on the amenities of adjacent occupiers at No. 203 Pettits Lane contrary to Policy 7 of the Local Plan and the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document.",
