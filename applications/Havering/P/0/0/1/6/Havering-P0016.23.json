    "The proposed two-storey side and single storey rear extension cumulatively would be visually intrusive and detrimental to the character of the streetscene, the appearance of the host property and rear garden environment, contrary to Policy 7 and 26 of the Havering Local Plan 2021, the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document and Policy D1 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "The proposed two-storey side extension would, by reason of its excessive width, position close to the boundary of No.134 Maybank Avenue and degree of frontal projection ahead of the neighbour, be an intrusive and unneighbourly development and would have an adverse effect on the amenity of these neighbours, contrary to Policy 7 and 26 of the Havering Local Plan and the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document.",
    "In the absence of confirmation otherwise the arrangement of parking would be undeliverable due to the location of the dwelling on/in conflict with the adopted public highway. The development would accordingly fail to make adequate provision for off-street parking as would be required by Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 Policies 23 and 24 and London Plan Policy T6.",
