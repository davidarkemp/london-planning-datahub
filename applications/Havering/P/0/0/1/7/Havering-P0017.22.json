  "description": "Demolition of existing outbuilding and garage within the rear garden of 125 Rothbury Avenue and erection of a single storey 1B2P dwelling with associated parking and amenity space.",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed development by reason of its siting, scale and layout would constitute conspicuous and incongruent feature in the area and would fail to respond to distinctive local building forms and patterns of development detrimental to the character and appearance of the surrounding area contrary Local Plan policy 26.",
    "The proposed built form and associated hardstanding of the proposed development would fail to maximise opportunities for greening and enhance biodiversity and would result in significant adverse impacts on green infrastructure and biodiversity which has not been effectively mitigated against contrary to Local Plan policies 10 and 27 and London Plan policy G6.",
    "In the absence of a daylight and sunlight report it has not been demonstrated that the proposed dwelling would receive acceptable levels of daylight within or that its front garden would not be overshadowed and therefore result in a substandard form of accommodation contrary to Local Plan policy 7 and London Plan (2021) policy D6.",
    "Due to the location and condition of the access lane leading to the site entrance, the proposals would not be served by adequate and safe and inclusive access to meet the needs of future occupiers contrary to Local Plan Policies 7, 10 and 26, London Plan policies D5, D6 and D11 and paragraph 110(b) of the NPPF (2021).",
    "In the absence of swept path and visibility splay drawings it has not been demonstrated that vehicles can safely access and exit the site to ensure that there is no impacts on pedestrian and highway safety contrary to Local Plan policies 10, 23 and 24.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to the Agent by email on the 10/03/2022.",
    "The proposal, if granted planning permission on appeal, would be liable for a Mayoral and Havering Community Infrastructure Levy payment as it would create one additional residential unit and would add a net additional 56sqm of residential floor space.",
    "Therefore the proposal would incur a charge of £1,400 and £7,000 based on the calculation of £25 per square metre and £125 per square metre, subject to indexation.",
    "Further details with regard to CIL are available from the Council's website."
