    "The development to which this permission relates must be commenced not later than three years from the date of this permission.",

    "To comply with the requirements of Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended by Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004).",
    "The development hereby permitted shall not be carried out otherwise than in complete accordance with the approved plans, particulars and specifications (as set out on page one of this decision notice) and any other plans, drawings, particulars and specifications pursuant to any further approval of details as are approved by the Local Planning Authority",
    "Reason: The Local Planning Authority consider it essential that the whole of the development is carried out and that no departure whatsoever is made from the details approved, since the development would not necessarily be acceptable if partly carried out or carried out differently in any degree from the details submitted. Also, in order that the development accords with Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policy DC61.",
    "No development above ground shall be commenced unless and until a schedule of materials and samples of such materials and finishes and colours to be used for the external construction of the dwelling are submitted to and approved by the Local Planning Authority in writing and all materials used shall conform to those approved and thereafter the development shall be constructed with the approved materials.",
    "Reason: Insufficient information has been supplied with the application to judge the appropriateness of the materials to be used.  Submission of samples prior to commencement will ensure that the appearance of the proposed development will harmonise with the character of the surrounding area and comply with Policy DC61 of the Development Control Policies Development Plan Document.",
    "No building shall be occupied or use commenced until cycle storage is provided in accordance with details previously submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority. The cycle storage shall be permanently retained thereafter.",
    "Reason:-",
    "Insufficient information has been supplied with the application to demonstrate what facilities will be available for cycle parking.  Submission of this detail prior to occupation in the case of new building works or prior to the use commencing in the case of changes of use is in the interests of providing a wide range of facilities for non-motor car residents and sustainability.",
    "No building shall be occupied or use commenced until refuse and recycling facilities are provided in accordance with details which shall previously have been submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority. The refuse and recycling facilities shall be permanently retained thereafter.",
    "Reason:-",
    "Insufficient information has been supplied with the application to judge how refuse and recycling will be managed on site.  Submission of this detail prior to occupation in the case of new building works or prior to the use commencing in the case of changes of use will protect the amenity of occupiers of the development and also the locality generally and ensure that the development accords with the Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policy DC61.",
    "All dwellings hereby approved shall comply with Regulation 36 (2)(b) and Part G2 of the Building Regulations - Water Efficiency.",
    "Reason: In order to comply with Policy 5.15 of the London Plan.",
    "Prior to commencement full details of the drainage strategy, drainage layout, together with SUDS information to serve the development have been submitted to and agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority prior to works commencing on development. The scheme agreed shall be implemented strictly in accordance with such agreement unless subsequent amendments have been agreed with the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason: To ensure that the development is properly drained.",
    "Notwithstanding the provisions of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015, no development shall take place under Classes A to F, nor shall any walls, fences or other means of enclosure be erected under Part 2, Class A, unless permission under the provisions of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 has first been sought and obtained in writing from the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason: In the interests of green belt openness and to enable the Local Planning Authority to retain control over future development, and in order that the development accords with Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policies DC45 and DC61.",
    "The residential curtilage of the dwelling hereby approved shall be limited to an area 48m wide by 48m long, in accordance with Drawing number MDA/1017/01/03 Rev A and previous planning permission reference P0063.12.",
    "Reason: In the interests of green belt openness and in accordance with Policy DC45 of the Development Control Policies Development Plan Document.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35(2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management) Order 2015: No significant problems were identified during the consideration of the application, and therefore it has been determined in accordance with paragraph 38 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2018.",
    "Statement pursuant to Article 31 of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) (Amendment No. 2) Order 2012. The Local Planning Authority has acted positively and proactively in determining this application by assessing the proposal against all material considerations, including planning policies and any representations that may have been received and subsequently determining to grant planning permission in accordance with the presumption in favour of sustainable development, as set out within the National Planning Policy Framework.",
    "Where the developer proposes to discharge to a public sewer, prior approval from Thames Water Developer Services will be required.  The contact number is 08000093921 so to ensure that the surface water discharge from the site shall not be detrimental to the existing sewage system.",
    "A Trade Effluent Consent will be required for any Effluent discharge other than a 'Domestic Discharge'. Any discharge without this consent is illegal and may result in prosecution. Applications should be made at http://www.thameswater.co.uk/business/9993.htm or alternatively to Waste Water Quality, Crossness STW, Belvedere Road, Abbeywood, London. SE2 9AQ. Telephone: 020 3577 9200.",
    "A Groundwater Risk Management Permit from Thames Water will be required for discharging groundwater into a public sewer. Any discharge made without a permit is deemed illegal and may result in prosecution under the provisions of the Water Industry Act 1991. We would expect the developer to demonstrate what measures he will unde",
    "The developer is advised that surface water from the development in both its temporary and permanent states should not be discharged onto the highway.  Failure to prevent such is an offence.",
    "The proposal is liable for the Mayor of London Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). Based upon the information supplied with the application, the CIL payable would be £3600 (this figure may go up or down, subject to indexation).",
    "the intervening period from when the earlier schemes were consented London Borough of Havering has adopted its own CIL and consequently the development is also now liable for Havering CIL (HCIL). In this location this translates to a charge of £125 per sqm of new floor space, which translates to a contribution of £18000.",
    "CIL is payable within 60 days of commencement of development. A Liability Notice will be sent to the applicant (or anyone else who has assumed liability) shortly and you are required to notify the Council of the commencement of the development before works begin. Further details with regard to CIL are available from the Council's website.",
