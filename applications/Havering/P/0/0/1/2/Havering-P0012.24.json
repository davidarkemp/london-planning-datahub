    "The proposed side extensions would, by reason of their scale and positioning represent an over development of the site, adding substantial bulk which would detract from the existing symmetry and detached character of the dwelling. The extensions would introduce additional elements which would unnecessarily clutter the front elevation reducing the prominence of the existing gabled harmful to the character of the host dwelling and its contribution to the wider street scene contrary to Policies 7 and 26 of the Havering Local Plan and the Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD (2011).",
    "The proposed side extensions would, by reason of its excessive bulk, height and positioning close to the boundaries of the site, be an intrusive and unneighbourly form of development which would be unacceptably overbearing from the perspectives of neighbours harmful to their outlook causing material harm to the residential amenities of adjacent occupiers contrary to Policy 7 of the Havering Local Plan and the Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD (2011).",
