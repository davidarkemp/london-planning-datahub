    "The proposed development by reason of its excessive bulk and mass on this prominent location would appear as a dominant and visually intrusive feature detrimental to the character and appearance of the host dwelling and visual amenity of the surrounding area contrary to Havering Local Plan Policy 7 and Policy 26 and the design guidance within the Council's Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD.",
    "The proposed single storey rear extension by reason of its depth in relation to the rear building line of the neighbouring house at 2 Ferndown would lead to an unacceptable loss of amenity to this dwelling due to an overbearing impact and loss of light, contrary to Havering Local Plan Policy 7 and the guidance within the Council's Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: In accordance with paragraph 38 of the National Planning Policy Framework, improvements required to make the proposal acceptable were negotiated with Kirit Tailor via email on 29.3.23.  The revisions involved a redesign of the roof and a reduction in the depth of the single storey rear extension along the boundary with 2 Ferndown.  The applicant declined to make the suggested revisions."
