    "The site is within the area identified as Metropolitan Green Belt. The Local Development Framework and Government Guidance as set out in the NPPF is that in order to achieve the purposes of the Metropolitan Green Belt it is essential to retain and protect the existing rural character of the area so allocated and that the construction of new buildings are inappropriate in the Green Belt and exceptions to this are buildings for agriculture and forestry. There is no agricultural requirement has been demonstrated for the development and the proposed development is considered to be inappropriate in principle in the Green Belt. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies CP14, DC45 and DC47 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document, Policy 7.16 of the London Plan 2016  as well as the provisions of the National Planning Policy Framework 2018.",
    "The proposed development would, by reason of its scale, bulk, mass and siting, combined with the associated area of hardstanding, have a materially adverse impact on the openness and on the rural character of the Green Belt contrary to Policies CP14, DC45 and DC47 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document, Policy 7.16 of the London Plan 2016  as well as the provisions of the National Planning Policy Framework 2018.",
    "In the absence of a legal agreement to secure contributions towards the demand for school places arising from the development, the proposal fails to satisfactorily mitigate the infrastructure impact of the development, contrary to the provisions of Policies DC29 and DC72 of the Development Control Policies DPD and Policy 8.2 of the London Plan.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reasons for it was given to the agent, P.A Design via email on 5th April 2019."
