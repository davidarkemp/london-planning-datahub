    "The proposed development, would by reason of its bulk, mass and siting including the existing extensive extensions on the site, represent an overdevelopment of the garden environment which is inconsistent with the prevailing open character of the rear garden scene and pattern of development, contrary to Policy 26 of the Local Plan 2021 and the Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD (2011).",
    "The proposed development, which could function as a self-contained residential unit in the rear garden scene, would result in an unprecedented and unacceptable impact on visual amenity, including additional comings and goings, noise and disturbance associated with the use and would be out of character with site and surrounding areas, contrary to Policy 26 of the Local Plan 2021 and the Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD.",
