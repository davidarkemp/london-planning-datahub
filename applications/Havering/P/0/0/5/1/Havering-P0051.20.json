  "description": "Change of Use from Use Class C3 (Residential) to Use Class C2 (Childrens Care Home)",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposal would result in the loss of permanent residential accommodation without any evidence that there is a compelling need for the proposed use to amount to especial circumstance for the loss of residential accommodation contrary to policy of London of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD.",
    "The proposed use would create an uplift in occupancy which would be out of keeping with the surrounding suburban context and would materially change the character of the subject property and the surrounding environment. This would be likely to present in an increased comings and goings to the site which would be over and above what could be regarded as acceptable and which would be detrimental to local character and the amenity of adjoining and nearby occupiers. The development would then be both detrimental to local character and the amenity of nearby occupiers contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD.",
    "The proposal to provide 6 car parking spaces to the front of the premises on a corner location without appropriate sight lines would potentially result in adverse impact upon safety of pedestrian and vehicle uses within the vicinity of the site. Further, there is little information with respect to the car parking demand as a result of the proposed use of the site for young adults and their carers. In this respect, potentially there would be a deficit in off-street parking which would lead to increased competition for on-street parking in a location which is observed to have existing parking stress. Increased competition for spaces would be to the detriment of the amenity of surrounding neighbouring occupiers and symptomatic of the inappropriateness of the use sought. The proposed development would, by reason of the inadequate on site car parking provision, result in unacceptable overspill onto the adjoining roads to the detriment of highway safety and the free flow of traffic contrary",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to the applicant on 30.12.2020"
