    "The proposed development would through the form of the new dwelling and alterations to the main dwelling to faciliate this present as conspicuously narrow in the street-scene and read as a poorly conceived addition to the main building which would neither reflect its character or prevailing patterns of development. The proposed development would therefore be contrary to Policies 7 and 26 of the Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 and also Paragraph 135 of the NPPF which amongst other considerations requires development add to the overall quality of an area and be sympathetic to local character.",
    "The proposed dwelling through its scale, bulk, mass, location of openings and close relationship to bedroom 4 of the adjoining HMO would form an unneighbourly relationship which would be detrimental to both outlook and light received to this room. Furthermore this arrangement would be unneighbourly for occupiers of each through the introduction of a new unit of accommodation removed from the main household at 1 Ethelburga Road in such close proximity, disrupting existing arrangements and detrimental to privacy. As such the proposals do not comply with the objectives of London Plan Policy D6, Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 Policy 7 and the Framework, specifically Para 135 which requires that development provide a high standard of amenity for future users.",
    "The proposed self-contained unit would in whichever form it is used, not comply with internal spacing standards resulting in a substandard arrangement of accommodation to the detriment of the amenity of prospective occupiers. The proposals fail to comply with Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 Policy 7, London Plan Policy D6 and the Framework which at Para 135 requires development provide a high standard of amenity for existing and future occupants.",
    "The proposals would not provide private amenity space for the new dwelling and show an arrangement which would be reliant on a close relationship with the occupiers of the adjoining HMO through the location of cycle/refuse storage and communal spaces. It is not considered that this reflects a high quality living arrangement and in doing so align with the objectives of Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 Policy 7, London Plan Policy D6 or the Framework which at Para 135 which amongst other considerations requires development provide a high standard of amenity for existing and future occupants.",
    "The proposals would fail to make adquate provision for off-street  parking and in the absence of a mechanism to prevent future occupants of the new dwelling from seeking/obtaining a residents parking permit would contribute to existing parking stress to the detriment of surrounding neighbouring amenity. It has not been demonstrated that there would not be a material impact on the functioning of the highway or that the cumulative impacts would not be severe. The proposals are therefore contrary to Havering Local Plan Policies 23 and 24 which seek amongst other things to ensure adequate parking provision is made and that no unacceptable impacts on highway safety would occur. Further to this there would be conflict with Para 115 of the NPPF in the absence of any evidence otherwise.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to the agent in writing 09-04-2024",
    "The proposal, if granted planning permission on appeal, would be liable for the Mayor of London and Havering Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). Based upon the information supplied with the application, the Mayoral CIL payable would be £1200  based on the calculation of £25.00 per square metre and the Havering Community Infrastructure Levy (HCIL) would be a charge of £6000 based on calculation of £125 per square metre. Each would be subject to indexation.",
