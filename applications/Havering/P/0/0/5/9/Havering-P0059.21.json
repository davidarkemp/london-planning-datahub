  "decision_conditions": [
    "The development to which this permission relates must be commenced not later than three years from the date of this permission.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To comply with the requirements of Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended by Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004).",
    "The development hereby permitted shall not be carried out otherwise than in complete accordance with the approved plans (as set out on page one of this decision notice).",
    "Reason:-",
    "For the avoidance of doubt and to ensure that the development is carried out as approved.",
    "If during development works any contamination should be encountered identified then works should halt immediately and the Local Planning Authority consulted to agree appropriate further action.",
    "Reason:-",
    "The development is situated on or within 250 metres of a current or historic landfill site or gravel pit.  Insufficient information has been supplied with the application to judge the risk arising from landfill gas.  Submission of an assessment prior to commencement will protect those redeveloping this site and any future occupants from potential landfill gas and will ensure that the development accords with the Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policies DC54 and DC61.",
    "All building operations in connection with the construction of external walls, roof, and foundations; site excavation or other external site works; works involving the use of plant or machinery; the erection of scaffolding; the delivery of materials; the removal of materials and spoil from the site, and the playing of amplified music shall only take place between the hours of 8.00am and 6.00pm Monday to Friday, and between 8.00am and 1.00pm on Saturdays and not at all on Sundays and Bank Holidays/Public Holidays.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To protect residential amenity, and in order that the development accords with the Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policy DC61.",
    "No works shall take place in relation to cabling works hereby approved until a Construction Method Statement to control the adverse impact of the development on the amenity of the public and nearby occupiers is submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority. The Construction Method statement shall include details of:",
    "a)  parking of vehicles of site personnel and visitors;",
    "b)  storage of plant and materials;",
    "c)  dust management controls;",
    "d)  measures for minimising the impact of noise and ,if appropriate, vibration arising from construction activities;",
    "e)  predicted noise and, if appropriate, vibration levels for construction using methodologies and at points agreed with the Local Planning Authority;",
    "f)  scheme for monitoring noise and if appropriate, vibration levels using methodologies and at points agreed with the Local Planning Authorities;",
    "g)  siting and design of temporary buildings;",
    "h)  scheme for security fencing/hoardings, depicting a readily visible 24-h",
    "There shall be no road closure during the school terms.",
    "Reason; In order to prevent the disruption of the traffic during school terms with the view to minimise the impact of the construction work to the local road users.",
    "No construction works with respect to cabling element shall commence until a Road Condition Survey, the details of which to be previously agreed in writing by the local planning authority has been submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority. A further Road Condition Survey shall then be submitted within one month of the completion of construction works. Any degradation of existing road surfaces directly due to the impact of construction of the development will be remediated in accordance with details to the previously agreed in writing by the local planning authority.",

    "HGV movements from the site shall be limited to a maximum of 14 two-way movements per day (7 in and 7 out movements). A log of HGV movements shall be kept and submitted to the local planning authority for review upon written request. This log shall record details of the registration, origin, destination and operators of each HGV entering and leaving a plot within the site and the time of such movements",
    "Reason: In the interests of amenity of the local residents and in accordance with policy DC61 and DC55 of the Local Plan core strategy 2008.",
    "Construction and decommissioning works on site shall only take place in accordance with the CTMP (ref. R005 dated June 2021) and in particular the following elements of that document:",
    "- Routing of construction vehicles; and",
    "- Time of HGVs accessing the site",
    "Reason: In order to minimise any adverse impacts arising from the construction of the development in accordance with policy DC32 of the adopted LDF Core Strategy and Policies for the Management of Development [2008].",
    "'Prior to commencement of works, details of the cabling works including a cross section plan of the trench and a construction method statement shall be submitted to and approved by the local planning authority.  The scheme shall then be implemented in accordance to the approved details'",
    "Reason;",
    "To protect the safety of the road users in accordance to policy DC32 of the adopted LDF Core Strategy and Policies for the Management of Development [2008].",
    "Changes to the public highway (including permanent or temporary access)",
    "- Planning approval does not constitute approval for changes to the public highway. Highway Authority approval will only be given after suitable details have been submitted considered and agreed. If new or amended access is required (whether temporary or permanent), there may be a requirement for the diversion or protection of third party utility plant or highway authority assets and it is recommended that early involvement with the relevant statutory undertaker takes place. The applicant must contact Engineering Services on 01708 433751 to discuss the scheme and commence the relevant highway approvals process. Please note that unauthorised work on the highway is an offence.",
    "Highway legislation",
    "- The developer (including their representatives and contractors) is advised that planning consent does not discharge the requirements of the New Roads and Street Works Act 1991 and the Traffic Management Act 2004. Formal",
    "Statement Required by Article 35(2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management) Order 2015: No significant problems were identified during the consideration of the application, and therefore it has been determined in accordance with paragraph 38 of the National Planning Policy Framework.",
    "For any development where a flood risk is identified, the Council as the Lead Local Flood Authority want to see developers consider and implement flood resilience/resistance measures into the buildings themselves. This is not to stop development but to ensure the protection for future residents is maintained and enhanced.",
    "The following measures are strongly recommended, although this list is not exhaustive:-",
    "-         Raising the level of the building by at least 300mm above local levels;",
    "-         Waterproof membrane in the ground floor;",
    "-         Waterproof plaster and waterproofing to ground floor;",
    "-         Electrics from the upstairs down and sockets high up off the ground floor;",
