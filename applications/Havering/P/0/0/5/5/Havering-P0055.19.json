    "The proposed detached garage would, by reason of its combined height, bulk, mass and position close to the boundaries of the site, create a dominant and visually intrusive feature within the streetscene, contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document, the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document and Policy 7.4 of the London Plan.",
    "The proposed development would, by reason of its close proximity to the preserved tree protected by Tree Preservation Order 1-19, be likely to result in unacceptable harm being caused to the health and safety of a protected tree; this would be materially harmful to the character and amenity of the street scene and surrounding area, contrary to Policy DC60 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document and the Protection of Trees during Development Supplementary Planning Document.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to Mr Anwar by e-mail."
