    "The proposed rear extension, by reason of its depth, would appear as an unacceptably dominant and visually intrusive feature in the rear garden harmful to the character and appearance of the surrounding area contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document and the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document.",
    "The proposed rear extension, by reason of being situated on higher ground level than No. 17 Lawns Way, would be an intrusive and unneighbourly development and have an adverse effect on the amenity of these adjacent occupiers contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document, the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document.",
