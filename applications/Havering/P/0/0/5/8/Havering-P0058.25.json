    "The proposal would, by reason of its positioning, scale, bulk and proximity to the nearby property at no.195a St Mary's Lane, be an intrusive, overbearing and unneighbourly development that would have a significant adverse effect on the amenities of these adjacent occupiers resulting in an overbearing impact, sense of enclosure, loss of outlook, overshadowing and loss of light contrary to Policy 7 of the Havering Local Plan and the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document.",
    "The proposal forms an incongruous feature and is conspicuous through its positioning, scale, bulk and lack of spacing which fails to take into account the character of the area generally, it would present as visually cramped within the site and detrimental to visual amenity.  The proposal is therefore be contrary to Policies 7 and 26 of the Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 and also the NPPF which requires fundamentally that development add to the overall quality of the area whilst also establishing or maintaining a strong sense of place.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, it was necessary to issue a decision as close to the statutory timeframe as possible as opposed to seeking amendments which would have significantly delayed the application.",
