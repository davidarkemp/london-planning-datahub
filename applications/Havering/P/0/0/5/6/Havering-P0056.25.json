  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposal would lead to a detrimental impact on the amenity of the first floor flat at no.168a Balgores Lane in terms of overlooking, loss of light, loss of outlook, overshadowing with an overbearing impact and sense of enclosure that would have a significant adverse effect on the amenities of these adjacent occupiers contrary to Policy 7 of the Havering Local Plan and the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document.",
    "The proposal would form an incongruous feature in the street-scene and the scale, bulk and flat roofed design would look out of place in the immediate area and would appear as an unacceptably dominant and visually intrusive feature in the street-scene harmful to the appearance and visual amenity of the surrounding area with a detrimental impact on the appearance of the host property itself.  The proposals would therefore be contrary to Policies 10, 7 and 26 of the Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 and also the NPPF which requires fundamentally that development add to the overall quality of the area whilst also establishing or maintaining a strong sense of place.",
    "There would be an inadequate private amenity space and it is considered that the proposed development would result in a poor quality living environment for future occupiers, resulting in substandard residential accommodation to the detriment of the amenity of future occupants of this proposed dwelling.  The proposals would therefore be contrary to Policies 10, 7 and 26 of the Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 and Policy D6 of the London Plan.",
    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority that adequate refuse and cycle storage could feasibly be accommodated on-site. The proposed development is therefore contrary to Local Plan policies 23, 24 and 35, and London Plan (2021) policy T5.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, it was necessary to issue a decision as close to the statutory timeframe as possible as opposed to seeking amendments which would have significantly delayed the application.",
    "In the event that this application is allowed through the appeals process the proposals would be liable for the following CIL contributions:",
    "Mayoral CIL (MCIL2) contribution of £1150 (x £25 per sqm).",
    "Havering CIL (HCIL) contribution of £5750 (x £125 per sqm).",
    "Each contribution would be subject to indexation."
