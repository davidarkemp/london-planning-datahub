  "decision_conditions": [
    "The development to which this permission relates must be commenced not later than three years from the date of this permission.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To comply with the requirements of Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended by Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004).",
    "The proposed development hereby approved shall be constructed in accordance with the materials detailed under Section 8 of the application form unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason: To ensure that the appearance of the proposed development will harmonise with the character of the surrounding area.",
    "The development hereby permitted shall not be carried out otherwise than in complete accordance with the approved plans (as set out on page one of this decision notice).",
    "Reason:-",
    "For the avoidance of doubt and to ensure that the development is carried out as approved.",
    "The existing Annexe shall continue to be used only for living accommodation as an integral part of the existing dwelling known as 1 Franks Cottages, St Marys Lane, Upminster and shall not be used as a separate unit of residential accommodation at any time.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To restrict the use of the premises to one compatible with the surrounding area and to enable the Local Planning Authority to exercise control over any future use not forming part of this application and that the development accords with the Local Plan Policy 7.",
    "The permission hereby granted shall be personal to the present occupiers, Mr. John Young. The ground floor internal layout of the main dwelling must be reinstated as and when the internal layout is no longer required or the property is vacated by the present occupiers.",
    "Reason:-",
    "In order that the annexe remains ancillary to the main dwelling and that the development accords with Local Plan policies 7 and 26.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: In accordance with paragraph 38 of the National Planning Policy Framework, improvements required to make the proposal acceptable were negotiated with the agent Mr Alan Davies with regards to the internal layout plan of the lounge with no outlook.
