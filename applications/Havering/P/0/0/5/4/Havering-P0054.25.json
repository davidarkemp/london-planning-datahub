    "The site is within the area identified in the Local Plan as Metropolitan Green Belt. The Local Plan, as well as the London Plan and the Guidance Given in the National Planning Policy Framework emphasise that in order to achieve the purposes of the Metropolitan Green Belt it is essential to retain and protect the existing rural character of the area so allocated and that the new development will only be permitted outside the existing built up areas in the most exceptional circumstances. The very special circumstances which have been submitted in this case are not considered to outweigh the substantial harm of the inappropriate development. The proposal is therefore contrary to the Local Plan (2021), London Plan (2021) and the advice given in the NPPF (2024).",
    "The proposed development would have a harmful impact on the character and appearance of the green belt by taking 0.8ha of open space which is open and rural in character and introducing forms of development which would be detrimental to the character and appearance of the green belt and reduce the openness. The proposed development would, by reason of its siting, bulk and massing, result in unsympathetic, visually intrusive development which would not preserve the open character and important historic landscape/character of the Cranham Conservation Area. The proposal would adversely affect the visual amenity of the area. The proposal is therefore would be contrary to the Guidance Given in Charpter 16 of the NPPF, Policies 26, 27 and 28 of the Local Plan, The Cranham Character Appraisal and the provisions of the London Plan",
    "The proposal would fail to comply with the policies promoting sustainable development with particular reference to inadequate and insufficient information relating to energy efficiency, whole life-cycle carbon; circular economy; urban greening; drainage and air quality.  The proposal is therefore contrary to policies SI2, SI3 and SI4 (Energy strategy compliance), Policy SI7 (Circular Economy), Policies G1, G4 and G5 (Urban greening and infrastructure), Policy SI13 (Sustainable drainage), Policy SI5 (Water efficiency), Policy SI1 Air Quality, Policy D14 (Ambient noise) of the London Plan (2021) and Policy 33 (Air quality), Policy 35\t(Waste management), Policy 36 (Low carbon design and renewable energy) of the Local Plan as well as the advice given in the National Planning Policy Framework (2021",
    "Whilst the applicant has agreed to offer financial contribution to offset emissions through purchasing carbon credits which would be considered acceptable in principle to reduce overall CO2 emission there is no mechanism i.e. undertaking to secure such payment. Consequently, the proposal would fail to achieve the sustainable development agenda and would be contrary to policy Plan policy3 of London Plan.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to the applicants' agent on 07.05.2025.",
    "The proposal, if granted planning permission on appeal, would be liable for the Mayor of London and Havering Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). Based upon the information supplied with the application, the Mayoral CIL payable would be £113225  based on the calculation of £25.00 per square metre and £566,125 the Havering Community Infrastructure Levy (HCIL) would be a charge of  based on4529m² calculation of £125 per square metre. Each would be subject to indexation.",
