  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposal would provide accommodation which is below the gross internal floor area required with no outdoor amenity space, waste or cycle storage space shown to the upper floor flat. It is considered that the shortfall in floor-space and ancillary spaces would result in a substandard level of living space for future occupiers. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy DC4, Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD, the Residential Design SPD, Policy 3.5 of The London Plan and the Technical Housing Standards - Nationally Described Space Standard. The proposal would also fail to accord with the core principle set out in Paragraph 127 of the National Planning Policy Framework which seeks to ensure a high standard of amenity for existing and future occupants of land and buildings.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reasons for it was given to the Agent by email in February 2021."
