    "The proposed development would, by reason of its height, bulk and mass as well as proximity to site boundaries, appear as an unacceptably dominant and visually intrusive feature in the streetscene harmful to the appearance of the surrounding area contrary to Policy DC61 of the London Borough of Havering's LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD 2008.",
    "The proposal would provide accommodation which is below the gross internal floor area required. It is considered that the shortfall in floor-space would result in a substandard level of living space for future occupiers. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy DC4, and Policy DC61 of the London Borough of Havering's LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD 2008, the London Borough of Havering's Residential Design SPD 2011, Policy 3.5 of The London Plan 2016 and the Technical Housing Standards - Nationally Described Space Standard 2015.",
    "The proposed development would, by reason of the inadequate provision of quality amenity space, result in a cramped over-development of the site to the detriment of future occupiers and the character of the surrounding area contrary to Policy DC61 of the London Borough of Havering's LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD 2008 and the London Borough of Havering's Residential Design SPD 2011.",
    "In the absence of a legal agreement to secure contributions towards the demand for school places arising from the development, the proposal fails to satisfactorily mitigate the infrastructure impact of the development, contrary to the provisions of Policies DC29 and DC72 of the London Borough of Havering's Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD 2008 and Policy 8.2 of the London Plan 2016.",
    "The proposal, if granted planning permission on appeal, would be liable for the Mayor of London Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). Based upon the information supplied with the application, the CIL payable would be Â£2,320. Further details with regard to CIL are available from the Council's website.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to Mr Benton via email on 15/03/2019."
