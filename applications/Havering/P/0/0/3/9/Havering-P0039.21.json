  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed single storey rear extension in combination with previous additions to the property would by virtue of their excessive protrusion, scale and mass lack subservience to the existing dwelling and would appear incongruous, dominant, visually intrusive and out of character  in the rear garden environment contrary to policy DC61 of the London Borough of Havering LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD 2008, and the London Borough of Havering Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD 2011.",
    "The rear extensions would, by reason of their excessive scale, siting and position be unneighbourly which would give rise to an uncomfortable overbearing effect and sense of enclosure, loss of outlook, loss of privacy and be harmful to the amenity of No. 134 Lynton Avenue contrary to policy DC61 of the Adopted Havering Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD 2008 and the Adopted Havering Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD 2011",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, it was necessary to issue a decision as close to the statutory timeframe as possible as opposed to seeking amendments which would have significantly delayed the application."
