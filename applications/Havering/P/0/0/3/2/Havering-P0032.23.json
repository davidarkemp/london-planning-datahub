    "The proposed first floor rear extension by reason of its excessive width, scale, bulk and mass would appear as an unacceptably dominant and visually intrusive feature in the street scene harmful to the appearance of the surrounding area contrary to Policy 26 of the Havering Local Plan and the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document.",
    "The proposal gives rise to a poor quality of residential design, with cramped garden plots and restricted outlook from habitable room windows of both the proposed dwelling and the donor property, as well as significantly harmful intrusion and overlooking of the garden area of the donor plot from the first floor rear extension and new first floor bedroom window to the proposed dwelling.  The resultant development would be intrusive and overbearing in relation to the  neighbouring property at No.219 Church Road, causing loss of privacy and amenity, contrary to Policy 7 and 26 of the Havering Local Plan.",
    "The development indicates parking provision in excess of that required by Policy T6.1 of the London Plan.  Furthermore, the parking arrangements are considered to be impractical and of limited functionality due to the layout of the parking area, shared provision between the properties and complexities of manoeuvring in this junction location, leading to potential harm to pedestrian and highway safety.  The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies T4 and T6.1 of the London Plan and Policy 23 of the Havering Local Plan.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to Mr Mindru by e-mail on 16-03-23.",
    "For Residential Development Only",
    "Please be advised that approval of this application from 1st September 2019 (either by London Borough of Havering, or subsequently by PINS if allowed on appeal following a refusal by London Borough of Havering) will attract a liability payment of £1,950 plus indexation in Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This charge has been levied under s.206 of the Planning Act 2008 and includes both the Mayor of London's CIL and Havering Council's CIL.",
    "London Borough of Havering, as CIL collecting authority, has responsibility for the collection of the Mayoral CIL, in addition to Havering's CIL, on commencement of the development.",
    "Your proposal is subject to a CIL Liability Notice indicating a levy of £1,950 plus indexation for the application, based on the Mayoral CIL levy rate for Havering of £25/sq.m plus Havering's charging rate for residential of £125/sq.m (Zone A), and the floorspace of 13 square metres.",
