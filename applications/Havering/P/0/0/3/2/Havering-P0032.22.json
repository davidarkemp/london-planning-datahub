    "The ground floor restaurant premises shall not be used other than between the hours of 09:00 and 23:00 on Mondays to Saturdays and between the hours of  09:00 and 23:00 on Sundays, Bank or Public holidays without the prior consent in writing of the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To enable the Local Planning Authority to retain control in the interests of amenity.",
    "The development hereby permitted shall not be carried out otherwise than in complete accordance with the approved plans (as set out on page one of this decision notice). Waste and refuse storage as shown shall be maintained in perpetutity for the lifetime of the development in the location shown and at no time shall any waste in association with the business use hereby permitted be stored outside of the premises.",

The scheme as may be approved shall be implemented prior to first occupation and thereafter retained in accordance with such details.",
    "Reason:  To prevent noise nuisance to adjoining/adjacent properties.",
    "Before any works commence a scheme for any new plant or machinery shall be submitted to the local planning authority to achieve the following standard. Noise levels expressed as the equivalent continuous sound level LAeq (1 hour) when calculated at the boundary with the nearest noise-sensitive premises shall not exceed LA90 -10dB and shall be maintained thereafter to the satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:  To prevent noise nuisance to adjoining/adjacent properties.",

Thereafter, the equipment shall be properly maintained and operated during normal working hours.",
    "Reason:  To protect the amenity of occupiers of nearby premises",
    "All modes of transport used in connection with the delivery aggregator or the delivery of takeaway shall not be parked on the forecourt of the application site.",
