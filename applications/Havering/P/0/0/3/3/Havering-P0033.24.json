    "The constraints of the site would be to the detriment of the amenity of future occupiers. The proposal would lead to substandard living space / storage space, poor quality outlook from habitable rooms and unpractical amenity spaces to the detriment of the future occupiers, contrary to the aims of Policies 7, 10 and 26 of the Havering Local Plan 2021 and Policies D4 and D6 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "The proposed development would, by reason of the high fencing next to the proposed parking space and the lack of suitable visibility splays would be detrimental to highway and pedestrian safety and contrary to Policies 23 & 24 of the Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 and the Manual for Streets Document (March 2007).",
    "The proposal would result in loss of significant degree of greenery due to the loss of the street tree in order to accommodate the dropped kerb. This tree contribute to the evolving character of the streetscene and surroundings. In this respect the proposal would be contrary to policies 27 of the Local Plan, G7 of the London Plan and the advice in the National Planning Policy Framework.",
    "The proposal, if granted planning permission on appeal, would be liable for the Mayor of London and Havering Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). Based upon the information supplied with the application, the CIL payable would be £1020. Further details with regard to CIL are available from the Council's website.",
