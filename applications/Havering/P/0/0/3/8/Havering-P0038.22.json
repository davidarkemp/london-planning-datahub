  "description": "Conversion of two storey dwelling into 1 x 2-bed, 1 x 1-bed, and 1 x studio self-contained flats, involving demolition of rear roof to form terrace garden, and addition of rear access to first floor.",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposals to convert the existing dwellinghouse with an original floorspace of less than 120sqm would be unacceptable in principle as it would result in the loss of a family sized dwelling of where there is a recognised shortage of family accommodation in the Borough,  with no reprovision of a similar existing larger unit on site. The proposals would undermine the objective of ensuring mixed and balanced communities contrary to Local Plan policy 9.",
    "The proposed development, by reason of its design with its rear roof terrace and rear stairs would be out of character, and resulting in significant loss of privacy to the ground floor unit and nearby occupiers; lack of private amenity space for the second floor unit, inadequate level of  internal floorspace standards and room sizes; providing a constrained and sub-standard residential accommodation for future occupiers which would adversely impact on their living condition, contrary to the aims and objectives of London Plan Policy D6 and Policy 7 of the Local Plan 2021.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, it was necessary to issue a decision as close to the statutory timeframe as possible as opposed to seeking amendments which would have significantly delayed the application."
