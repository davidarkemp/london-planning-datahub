    "To comply with the requirements of Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended by Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004).",
    "The development hereby permitted shall not be carried out otherwise than in complete accordance with the approved plans (as set out on page one of this decision notice).",
    "Reason:-",
    "For the avoidance of doubt and to ensure that the development is carried out as approved.",
    "No works above damp proof course shall commence until the details of all proposed walls, fences and boundary treatment as well as the details of a privacy screen as indicated on the terrace (with obscure glass not less than  level 4 on the standard scale of obscurity) shall be submitted and approved in writing by, the Local Planning Authority.  The boundary treatment including the privacy screen shall then be carried out in accordance with the approved details before first occupation of the development and retained permanently thereafter to the satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:",
    "Insufficient information has been supplied with the application to judge the appropriateness of any boundary treatment.  Submission of this detail prior to commencement will protect the visual amenities of the development, prevent undue overlooking of adjoining property and ensure that the development accords with the Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policy DC61.",
    "No works above damp proof course shall take place in relation to any of the development hereby approved until full details of doors and windows and samples of all external materials to be used in the construction of the development hereby permitted are submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority and thereafter the development shall be constructed with the approved materials.",
    "Reason:-",
    "Insufficient information has been supplied with the application to judge the appropriateness of the doors, windows, materials and rainwater goods to be used.  Submission of samples prior to commencement will safeguard the appearance of the building and the character of the immediate area, and will ensure that the development accords with the Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policy DC61",
    "No works above damp proof course shall take place in relation to any of the development hereby approved until there has been submitted to and approved by the Local Planning Authority a scheme of hard and soft landscaping, which shall include indications of all existing trees and shrubs on the site, and details of any to be retained, together with measures for the protection in the course of development. All planting, seeding or turfing comprised within the scheme shall be carried out in the first planting season following completion of the development and any trees or plants which within a period of 5 years from completion of the development die, are removed or become seriously damaged or diseased shall be replaced in the next planting season with others of a similar size and species, unless otherwise agreed in writing by the local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:-",
    "Insufficient information has been supplied with the application to judge the appropriateness of the hard and soft landscaping",
    "Notwithstanding the provisions of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015, no porches shall be erected to the front or side of the extension hereby permitted, without the express permission in writing of the Local Planning Authority.",

    "Notwithstanding the provisions of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015, no window or other opening (other than those shown on the submitted and approved plan,) shall be formed in the flank walls or the roof of the building(s) hereby permitted, unless specific permission under the provisions of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 has first been sought and obtained in writing from the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:-",

    "The proposals should provide a 2.1 by 2.1 metre pedestrian visibility splay on either side of the proposed access, set back to the boundary of the public footway.  There should be no obstruction or object higher than 0.6 metres within the visibility splay.",
    "Reason:-",
    "In the interests of highway safety, and in order that the development accords with the Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policy DC32.",
    "The proposed first floor flank window  shall be permanently glazed with obscure glass not less than  level 4 on the standard scale of obscurity and shall thereafter be maintained and permanently fixed shut and thereafter maintained, with the exception of any top hung fanlight(s).",
    "Reason:-",
    "In the interests of privacy, and in order that the development accords with the Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policy DC61.",
    "The roof area of the ground floor projection (saved for the area shown as terrace) hereby permitted shall not be used as a balcony, roof garden or similar amenity area without the grant of further specific permission from the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:-",
    "In the interests of the amenity of the occupiers of neighbouring dwelling, and in order that the development accords with the  Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policy DC61.",
    "The building(s) shall be so constructed as to provide sound insulation of 45 DnT,w + Ctr dB (minimum values) against airborne noise and 62 dB (maximum values) against impact noise to the satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason: To prevent noise nuisance to adjoining properties.",
    "No building shall be occupied or use commenced until refuse and recycling facilities are provided in accordance with details which shall previously have been submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority. The refuse and recycling facilities shall be permanently retained thereafter.",
    "Reason:-",
    "Insufficient information has been supplied with the application to judge how refuse and recycling will be managed on site.  Submission of this detail prior to occupation in the case of new building works or prior to the use commencing in the case of changes of use will protect the amenity of occupiers of the development and also the locality generally and ensure that the development accords with the Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policy DC61.",

    "Reason:-",
    "Insufficient information has been supplied with the application to demonstrate what facilities will be available for cycle parking.  Submission of this detail prior to occupation in the case of new building works or prior to the use commencing in the case of changes of use is in the interests of providing a wide range of facilities for non-motor car residents and sustainability.",

    "Insufficient information has been supplied with the application to judge the impact arising from any external lighting required in connection with the building or use.  Submission of this detail prior to occupation in the case of new building works or prior to the use commencing in the case of changes of use will protect residential amenity and ensure that the development accords with the Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policy DC61.",
    "Before the building(s) hereby permitted is first occupied, the area set aside for car parking shall be laid out and surfaced to the satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority and retained permanently thereafter for the accommodation of vehicles visiting the site and shall not be used for any other purpose.",
    "Reason:-",
