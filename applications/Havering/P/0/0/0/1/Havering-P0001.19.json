    "The development, in addition to the permitted 4m rear extension, would by reason of its height, design, position and bulk would appear out of scale and character with the dwelling and locality. The rear extension is materially harmful to the visual amenity of the surrounding area, as well as visually harmful  and intrusive cumulatively in the context of previous developments to the dwelling, and within the garden scene, contrary to Policy DC61 of the London Borough of Havering LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD 2008.",
