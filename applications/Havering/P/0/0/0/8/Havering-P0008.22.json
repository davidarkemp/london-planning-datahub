    "The proposed first floor side/rear extension would, by reason of its position close to the boundary of No. 10 Roxburgh Avenue, would be an intrusive and unneighbourly development and would have an adverse effect on the amenity of these neighbours, contrary to Local Plan Policy 7 and the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Improvements to the proposal to replace the originally proposed parapet wall of the first floor side/rear extension with a sit-on gutter were negotiated during the course of the application. However, the impact of the first floor side/rear extension was considered at detailed assessment stage to be unacceptable. Further significant alteration would have been required to bring the development within the realms of acceptability so it was decided to proceed to determine the application."
