    "The proposal, by reason of the increased amounts of activity within the building and outdoor areas, together with an intensification of the residential use in such close proximity to neighbouring properties, would result in unacceptable levels of noise and disturbance and comings and goings to the detriment of residential amenity. The development would create an uplift in occupancy which would be out of keeping with the surrounding suburban context, which would be over and above what could be regarded as acceptable and reasonably expected with a single family dwelling house and would be detrimental to local character and the amenity of adjoining and nearby occupiers. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy DC4 and DC61 of the Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD.",
    "The proposed development would, by reason of the inadequate on site car parking provision, result in unacceptable overspill onto the adjoining roads to the detriment of highway safety and residential amenity and contrary to Policy DC4 and DC33 of the Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD.",
