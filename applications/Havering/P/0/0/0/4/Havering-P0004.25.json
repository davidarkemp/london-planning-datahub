    "According to the existing floor plans, the original flat had a gross internal floor space of approximately 105.98 square metres, which fails to meet the standard of 120 square metres, thereby resulting in the unacceptable loss of a much needed homes within the Borough, contrary to Policy 8(i) of the Havering Local Plan 2021.",
    "The HMO for eight occupants results in an intensification of the site and results in significant harm to residential amenity from noise, disturbance and activity, contrary to Policies 7, 8 and 34 of the Havering Local Plan and the National Planning Policy Framework.",
    "The kitchen area for eight people is just 8.49 square metres, there is no separate dining room or living area, therefore the property fails to provide adequate communal living space for the occupiers of the HMO, which provides a poor quality living environment harmful to the amenity of existing and future occupiers contrary to Policies 7 and 8 of the Havering Local Plan, the HMO East London Guidance and the National Planning Policy Framework.",
    "The proposals fail to demonstrate adequate levels of off street parking. The nature of the HMO use by unrelated occupants combined with the level of occupancy is considered likely to lead to increased vehicle ownership and overspill which would contribute unacceptably to existing levels of parking stress and limited on-street spaces within the locality to the detriment of the amenity of surrounding occupiers. The absence of any compelling evidence otherwise, such as a parking stress survey, means that it has not been demonstrated that there would not be conflict with Policy 8, London Plan Policy T6 and Para 115 of the Framework 2024. The lack of cycle parking details would fail to promote sustainable travel, contrary to London Plan Policy T5.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, it was necessary to issue a decision as close to the statutory timeframe as possible as no amendment will address the policy objection."
