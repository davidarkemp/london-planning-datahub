    "The site is within the area identified in the London Borough of Havering's LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document 2008 as Metropolitan Green Belt. The proposed two storey front/side and rear extensions would by reason of their height, roof form, scale, bulk, mass, depth and siting, result in disproportionate additions over and above the size of the original dwellinghouse would be inappropriate, in principle, within the Green Belt and result in material harm to the character and openness of the Metropolitan Green Belt. No special circumstances have been submitted in this case and the proposal is therefore contrary to Policy DC45 of the London Borough of Havering's LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document 2008 and the provisions of the National Planning Policy Framework 2019.",
    "The proposed extensions would by reason of their height, roof form, scale, bulk, mass, depth and siting, lack subservience to the existing dwelling and appear incongruous, dominant and visually intrusive in the streetscene harmful to the character and appearance of the area contrary to Policy",
    "DC61 of the London Borough of Havering's LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD 2008 and the Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD 2011.",
    "The proposal, by reason of its height, roof form, scale, bulk, mass, excessive depth and siting, is deemed to be unneighbourly and would appear overbearing, dominant and visually intrusive in the front and rear garden environment harmful to the amenity of adjacent occupiers, including loss of light and outlook, particularly Neath Oak and Oaklands, contrary to Policy DC61 of the London Borough of Havering's LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD  2008 and the Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD 2011.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to the agent via email on 30th April 2019.",
    "The proposal, if granted planning permission on appeal, would be liable for the Mayor of London Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). Based upon the information supplied with the application, the CIL payable would be Â£5,850. Further details with regard to CIL are available from the Council's website."
