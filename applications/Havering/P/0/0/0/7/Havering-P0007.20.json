    "The cumulative impact of the proposed hip to part gable end roof conversion, the first floor rear extensions would unbalance the appearance of the pair of semi-detached bungalows and appear as an unacceptably dominant and visually intrusive feature in the street scene and rear garden environment and be harmful to the appearance of the surrounding area, contrary to Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD and Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD.",
    "The proposed rear dormer extension (first floor rear projections) would, by reason of its excessive depth, height and position close to the boundaries of the site, be an intrusive and unneighbourly development as well as having an adverse effect on the amenities of adjacent occupiers contrary to Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD and Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD.",
