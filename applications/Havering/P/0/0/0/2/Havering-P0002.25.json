    "The proposed wrap-around extension would, by reason of its excessive depth and position close to the boundary of the site, be harmful to the character of the rear garden scene and result in an intrusive and unneighbourly development with adverse effects on the amenities of adjacent occupiers at no. 2 Malvern Road, resulting in a sense of overbearing development, an increased  sense of enclosure, overshadowing and loss of outlook and light, contrary to Havering's Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD (adopted 2011) and Policies 7 and 26 of the Havering Local Plan.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, it was necessary to issue a decision as close to the statutory timeframe as possible as opposed to seeking amendments which would have significantly delayed the application."
