    "The HMO for eight occupants results in an intensification of the site and results in significant harm to residential amenity from noise, disturbance and activity associated with the use, contrary to Policies 7, 8 and 34 of the Havering Local Plan and the National Planning Policy Framework.",
    "The kitchen and dining area for eight people with 23 sqm would fail to provide adequate communal living space for the occupiers of the HMO, resulting in a poor quality living environment harmful to the amenity of existing and future occupiers, contrary to Policies 7 and 8 of the Havering Local Plan, the HMO East London Guidance and the National Planning Policy Framework.",
    "The proposals fail to demonstrate adequate levels of off street parking. The nature of the HMO use by unrelated occupants combined with the level of occupancy is considered likely to lead to increased vehicle ownership and overspill which would contribute unacceptably to existing levels of parking stress and limited on-street spaces within the locality to the detriment of the amenity of surrounding occupiers. The absence of any compelling evidence otherwise, such as a parking stress survey, means that it has not been demonstrated that there would not be conflict with Policy 8, London Plan T6 and Para 115 of the Framework 2024.",
    "The proposals fail to make adequate provision for the amenity of all occupants through the limited floor area of the second floor rear-facing bedrooms ( 5 and 6). The limited size of these rooms would represent a substandard arrangement which would not comply with the East London HMO Guidance, thereby conflicting with the requirements of Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 Policy 8(vii).",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, it was necessary to issue a decision as close to the statutory timeframe as possible as no amendment will address the policy objection."
