    "The rear extension would, by reason of its excessive depth and position close to the boundaries of the site, be an intrusive and unneighbourly development as well as having an adverse effect on the amenities of adjacent occupiers at 28 and 32 Heath Park Road contrary to Policy 7 (Residential Design and Amenity) of the Havering Local Plan Adopted November 2021 and Section 5 (Rear extensions) of the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document Adopted 2011.",
    "The proposed development by reason of its flat roof on the first floor rear extension would unacceptably compromise the architectural view from the garden scene. Furthermore, the proposed development would appear as poorly designed that would therefore appear visually intrusive and harmful to the host dwelling, street and garden scene and the character of the area contrary to the Supplementary Design Guidance (Residential Extensions and Alterations), policies D1, D3 and D4 of The London Plan (2021) and Policy 26 of the Local Plan.",
    "NOTE: The whole of the rear extension is unauthorised and the decision on this application is based on a proposal to retain it."
