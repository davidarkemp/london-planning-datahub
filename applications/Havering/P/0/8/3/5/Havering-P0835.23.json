    "The development to which this permission relates must be commenced not later than three years from the date of this permission.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To comply with the requirements of Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended by Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004).",
    "The proposed development hereby approved shall be constructed in accordance with the materials detailed under materials section of the application form unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason: To ensure that the appearance of the proposed development will harmonise with the character of the surrounding area.",
    "The slatted design fence which would be fully solid without gaps shall be provided on either side in accordance with drawing numbers 01012022_28ST_9_5 REV AUG 2023 & 01012022_28ST_11_5 REV AUG 2023 within the rear garden. The fencing shall be permanently retained and maintained thereafter.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To protect the visual amenities of the development and prevent undue overlooking of adjoining property.",
    "The development hereby permitted shall not be carried out otherwise than in complete accordance with the approved plans (as set out on page one of this decision notice).",
    "Reason:-",
    "For the avoidance of doubt and to ensure that the development is carried out as approved.",
    "The proposed ground floor flank windows as shown on drawings 01012022_28ST_9_5 REV AUG 2023 and  01012022_28ST_11_5 REV AUG 2023 shall be permanently glazed with obscure glass not less than level 4 on the standard scale of obscurity and shall thereafter be maintained and  permanently fixed shut and thereafter maintained, with the exception of any top hung fanlight(s). Any open-able part of these windows shall be 1.7m above the finished floor level in the room which they are installed, as indicated on the proposed plans.",
    "Reason:-",
    "In the interests of privacy.",
    "The roof lights/windows adjacent to No.30 Stanley Road North, Rainham as show on drawings 01012022_28ST_9_5 REV AUG 2023, 01012022_28ST_12_05 REV AUG 2023, 01012022_28ST_13_05 REV AUG 2023, 01012022_28ST_14_05 REV AUG 2023 & 01012022_28ST_17_05 REV AUG 2023 shall be  obscure-glazed, and  non-opening unless the parts of the window which can be opened are more than 1.7m above the floor of the room in which the window is installed.",
    "Reason:",
    "In the interest of privacy and to protect the amenity of the adjacent neighbours",
    "a. Prior to the commencement of any groundworks or development of the site, details shall be submitted to and agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority setting out suitable gas protection measures to be employed on site including, but not necessarily limited to, the installation of a suitable gas resistant membrane, in compliance with BS 8485:2015.  The gas protection measures shall be carried out in strict accordance with the agreed details.",
    "b. Upon completion of installation, a 'Verification Report' must be submitted demonstrating that the works have been carried out.",
    "Reason:",
    "Insufficient information has been supplied with the application to judge the risk arising from landfill gases (methane and carbon dioxide).  Submission of an assessment prior to commencement will protect people on or close to the site from the risks associated with migrating landfill gas, and will ensure that the development accords with the Havering Local Plan.",
    "Notwithstanding the provisions of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015, no window or other opening (other than those shown on the submitted and approved plan,) shall be formed in the flank wall(s) of the building(s) hereby permitted, unless specific permission under the provisions of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 has first been sought and obtained in writing from the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:-",
    "In order to ensure a satisfactory development that will not result in any loss of privacy or damage to the environment of neighbouring properties which exist or may be proposed in the future.",
    "The roof area of the extension hereby permitted shall not be used as a balcony, roof garden or similar amenity area without the grant of further specific permission from the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:-",
    "In the interests of the amenity of the occupiers of neighbouring dwelling.",
    "The proposal is liable for the Mayor of London Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). The Mayoral CIL levy rate for Havering is £25/m² and is chargeable for each additional square metre of residential gross internal [floor] (GIA).  Based upon the information supplied with the application, £3,650 would be payable due to result in a new residential property with 146m² of GIA, however this may be adjusted subject to indexation.",
    "The proposal is also liable for Havering Council's CIL. Havering's CIL charging rate for residential is £125m² (Zone A)  for each additional square metre of GIA. Based upon the information supplied with the application, £18,250 would be payable, subject to indexation.",
    "These charges are levied under s.206 of the Planning Act 2008.  CIL is payable within 60 days of commencement of development. A Liability Notice will be sent to the applicant (or anyone else who has assumed liability) shortly and you are required to notify the Council of the commencement of the deve",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: In accordance with paragraph 38 of the National Planning Policy Framework, improvements required to make the proposal acceptable were negotiated with Mrs Liskauskaite (Agent) by e-mail. The revisions involved reducing the eaves height from 4.185m to 3.886m so not to impact on habitable room windows of No.30 Stanley Road North Rainham. The amendments were subsequently submitted on 15-08-23."
