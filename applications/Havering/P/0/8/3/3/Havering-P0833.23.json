    "The proposed single storey side extension, by reason of its scale, bulk, mass and position forward of the building line of Appleby Drive would appear as an unacceptably dominant and visually intrusive feature, harmful to the appearance of the street scene, contrary to Policy 26 of the Havering Local Pan, the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document and Policy D4 of the London Plan.",
    "Insufficient information has been provided in respect to on-site parking and there is a concern that the proposed development would remove on-site parking, as a result of the proposal. The inadequate depth of the drive remaining to the side of the property would result in the risk of vehicles overhanging the public footway, degrading the level of service for pedestrians and also the efficiency of the highway network, resulting in highway safety concerns, contrary to Policies T4 and T6 of the London Plan, Policy 24 of the London Borough of Havering Local Plan, the Havering Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD and the NPPF.",
    "The proposed single storey side extension, by reason of its projection forward of the neighbouring dwelling at No.27 Appleby Drive and its excessive height and position close to the boundaries of the site, would be an intrusive and unneighbourly development as well as having an adverse effect on the amenities of adjacent occupiers contrary to Policy 7 of the Havering Local Plan and the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to Mr Wasti (Agent) by e-mail on 20-07-23."
