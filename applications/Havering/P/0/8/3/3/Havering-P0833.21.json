    "The proposed rear extension would project beyond an unauthorised rear extension and as a result of its bulk, mass, scale and position would appear as an unacceptably overbearing dominant feature which would be detrimental to the character and appearance of the property and materially harmful to the visual amenity of the rear garden environment contrary to policies D3 and D4 of The London Plan (2021), policy DC61 of the London Borough of Havering LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD 2008, and the London Borough of Havering Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD 2011.",
    "The proposed single storey rear extensions would project beyond an unauthorised rear extension and as a result of its excessive depth and close proximity to the western shared boundary, be unneighbourly which would give rise to an uncomfortable and overbearing effect resulting in an increased sense of enclosure and loss of outlook to the amenity of the occupiers of no. 44 Weald Way contrary to Policy DC61 of the London Borough of Havering LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD 2008, and the London Borough of Havering Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD 2011.",
    "The applicants are remined that the proposed addition of a hipped roof on existing first floor flat roof side extension would impact on the lawfulness of the loft conversion approved under application reference D0024. The resulting cubic volume allowance would be exceeded if the roof alterations are built simultaneously.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to Mrs Dilnashin Nawab via email on 23rd June 2021."
