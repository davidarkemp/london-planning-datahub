    "The proposed development, by reason of the roof design would form an incongruous and jarring design that lacks subservience to the existing dwelling and would appear visually intrusive in the rear garden and front scene harmful to the appearance of the host building and surrounding area contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document, the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document and Policy 7.4 of the London Plan.",
    "The proposed side extension to the west would,  by reason of its depth, width, location and general bulk, be of an incongruous design and appear as an unacceptably dominant and visually intrusive feature in the streetscene, harmful to the appearance of property and the surrounding area contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document, the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document and Policy 7.4 of the London Plan.",
    "The proposed extension would, by reason of its depth and height appear overbearing and be an intrusive and unneighbourly development when viewed from the rear garden of the adjoining property and is considered harmful to the amenity of No. 53 Sackville Crescent contrary to Policy DC61 of the London Borough of Havering LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD 2008, and the London Borough of Havering Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD 2011.",
    "For Residential Development Only",
