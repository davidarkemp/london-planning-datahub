The revisions involved showing the correct depth of the rear extension. Neighbours were re-consulted for a further 21 days as the depth was increasing. A further revised plan was received during the process, as the proposed elevations showed the original pitched roof over the original kitchen and two flank windows, which are no longer there. Neighbours were not re-consulted as the impact was being lessened. The amendments were subsequently submitted on 12-10-22 & 08-11-22."
