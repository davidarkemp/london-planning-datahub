Given the proximity of the proposed structure to the residential accommodation it is feared that the proposal would have undue impact upon the amenities of the adjoining residential occupiers, by reason of unacceptable degree of noise, disturbance and smell, contrary policies 7 and 34 of the adopted Havering Local Plan 2021.",
