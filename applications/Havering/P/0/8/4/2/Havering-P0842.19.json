    "Reason: Insufficient information has been supplied with the application to judge the appropriateness of the materials to be used.  Submission of samples prior to commencement will ensure that the appearance of the proposed development will harmonise with the character of the surrounding area and comply with Policy DC61 of the Development Control Policies Development Plan Document.",
    "The development hereby permitted shall not be carried out otherwise than in complete accordance with the approved plans, particulars and specifications (as set out on page one of this decision notice).",
    "Reason: The Local Planning Authority consider it essential that the whole of the development is carried out and that no departure whatsoever is made from the details approved, since the development would not necessarily be acceptable if partly carried out or carried out differently in any degree from the details submitted. Also, in order that the development accords with Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policy DC61.",
    "No works shall take place in relation to any of the development hereby approved (except works required to secure compliance with this condition) until the following Contaminated Land reports (as applicable) are submitted to and approved in writing by  the Local Planning Authority:",
    "a) A Phase I (Desktop Study) Report documenting the history of this site, its surrounding area and the likelihood of contaminant/s, their type and extent incorporating a Site Conceptual Model.",
    "b) A Phase II (Site Investigation) Report if the Phase I Report confirms the possibility of a significant risk to any sensitive receptors.  This is an intrusive site investigation including factors such as chemical testing, quantitative risk assessment and a description of the site ground conditions.  An updated Site Conceptual Model should be included showing all the potential pollutant linkages and an assessment of risk to identified receptors.",

    "No works shall take place in relation to any of the development hereby approved until a survey (in accordance with BS 5837) and scheme for the protection of preserved trees on the site has been submitted to and agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority. Such scheme shall contain details of the erection and maintenance of fences or walls around the trees, details of underground measures to protect roots, the control of areas around the trees and any other measures necessary for the protection of the trees. Such agreed measures shall be implemented before development commences and kept in place until the approved development is completed.",

The submitted scheme is expected to make provision for planting to the front and side boundaries of the site of a height and type that will provide a sufficient privacy screen to the garden areas of the ground floor units within the development. All planting, seeding or turfing comprised within the scheme shall be carried out in the first planting season following completion of the development and any trees or plants which within a period of 5 years from completion of the development die, are removed or become seriously damaged",

The boundary development shall then be carried out in accordance with the approved details and retained permanently thereafter to the satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason: Insufficient information has been supplied with the application to judge the appropriateness of any boundary treatment.  Submission of this detail prior to commencement will protect the visual amenities of the development, prevent undue overlooking of adjoining property and ensure that the development accords with the Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policy DC61",
    "Prior to the first occupation of the development hereby permitted, refuse and recycling facilities shall be provided in accordance with details which shall previously have been submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority. The refuse and recycling facilities shall be permanently retained thereafter.",

    "Reason: To minimise the impact of the development on the surrounding area in the interests of amenity.",
    "Before the building(s) hereby permitted is first occupied, provision shall be made within the site for eight car parking spaces and thereafter this provision shall be made permanently available for use, unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority. Each of the units within the development shall be provided with two dedicated parking space.",

Where any installations do not meet this emissions standard it should not be operated without the fitting of suitable NOx abatement equipment or technology as determined by a specialist to ensure comparable emissions.  The installation of the boilers shall be carried out in strict accordance with the agreed details and shall thereafter be permanently retained.  Following installation emissions certificates will need to be provided to the Local Planning Authority to verify boiler emissions.",
