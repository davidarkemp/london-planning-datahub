    "The proposed development and resultant appearance of the building, due to a combination of its regressed front building line, provision of forecourt parking and generic and utilitarian shop-front detailed design, would have an adverse and unacceptable impact on the street-scene, special interest and wider conservation area with regard to its character, appearance and setting. The proposed development would fail to preserve or enhance the character and appearance of the Conservation Area, contrary to the Planning (Listed Building and Conservation Areas) Act, the aims and objectives of the National Planning Policy Framework and LDF Policies DC61 and DC68.",
