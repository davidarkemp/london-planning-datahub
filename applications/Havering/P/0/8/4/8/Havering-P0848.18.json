  "description": "Demolition of detached garage and construct new detached chalet bungalow/ sub division of plot to provide amenity space",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed dwelling would, by reason of its gabled roof form, scale, siting and proximity to the boundaries of the site combined with its uncharacteristic design, give rise to a cramped appearance and overdevelopment of the plot which would be materially harmful to the character of the street-scene and therefore contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD.",
    "The proposed dwelling would, by reason of its roof form, including large rear dormer with rear facing windows, scale, siting and proximity to the boundaries of the site, appear a dominant, overbearing, unneighbourly and visually intrusive feature in the rear garden environment and cause overlooking and loss of privacy which would have a serious and adverse effect on the living conditions of adjacent occupiers, particularly No. 77 Hillcrest Road contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD.",
    "In the absence of a legal agreement to secure contributions towards the demand for school places arising from the development, the proposal fails to satisfactorily mitigate the infrastructure impact of the development, contrary to the provisions of Policies DC29 and DC72 of the Development Control Policies DPD and Policy 8.2 of the London Plan.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to Spaces Architecture via email on 18th September 2018.",
    "The proposal, if granted planning permission on appeal, would be liable for the Mayor of London Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). Based upon the information supplied with the application, the CIL payable would be Â£1,930. Further details with regard to CIL are available from the Council's website."
