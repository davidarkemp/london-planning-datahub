    "The proposed outbuilding through the design concept progressed, siting and massing would appear as an unacceptably dominant and visually intrusive feature in the rear garden environment and in views from the public realm which would  be detrimental to the spacious and open character of the Emerson Park Policy Area. Furthermore through its lack of subservience arising from its overall proportions and elongated plan form and in the absence of any information to the contrary the building would not be incidental to the main dwelling giving rise to potential harm to amenity. The proposals are therefore contrary to Policy 26 of the Havering Local Plan 2016-2031,  the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document and the guidance contained within the NPPF.",
    "The proposed outbuilding by reason of its scale, bulk, mass and coverage of the site would have an impact on the amenity of existing and future occupants of 12 The Witherings and would present as a permanent and overbearing feature giving rise to an increased sense of enclosure therefore diminishing the levels of amenity experienced.  It would be contrary to Policies 7 and 26 of the Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 and the Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD through this resultant harm and also the guidance contained within the NPPF.",
