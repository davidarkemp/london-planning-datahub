  "description": "Erection of a two storey, four bedroom dwelling to the rear of 28 Elm Grove",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed development would, by reason of its height, bulk, mass and design as well as proximity to site boundaries, appear as an unacceptably dominant and visually intrusive feature in the streetscene harmful to the appearance of the surrounding area contrary to Policy DC61 of the London Borough of Havering's LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD 2008.",
    "Viewed in the wider context, the redevelopment of the rear garden area of the donor property, subdivision of the site and introduction of a dwelling into the rear garden environment would form a jarring feature and one which would diminish the spacious characteristics of the area contrary to the objectives set out in the Emerson Park Policy Area SPD  and would result in a cramped over-development of the site to the detriment of future occupiers and the character of the surrounding area contrary to Policy DC61 of the London Borough of Havering's LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD 2008 and the London Borough of Havering's Residential Design SPD 2011.",
    "In the absence of a legal agreement to secure contributions towards the demand for school places arising from the development, the proposal fails to satisfactorily mitigate the infrastructure impact of the development, contrary to the provisions of Policies DC29 and DC72 of the London Borough of Havering's Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD 2008 and Policy 8.2 of the London Plan 2016.",
    "The proposal, if granted planning permission on appeal, would be liable for the Mayor of London Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). Based upon the information supplied with the application, the CIL payable would be Â£5,100. Further details with regard to CIL are available from the Council's website.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to the agent in writing 08-07-2019"
