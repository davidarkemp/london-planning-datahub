    "The proposed outbuilding, by reason of its combined height, bulk, mass and position close to the boundaries of the site, together with the changes in ground levels between this and neighbouring property, is considered to be an overbearing and unneighbourly development, which creates a dominant and visually intrusive feature in the rear garden environment, that is harmful to the amenity of adjacent occupiers No. 185 Clockhouse Lane, contrary to the Residential Extensions and Alteration SPD and Policy DC61 of the LDF Development Control Policies Plan Document.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Improvements to the proposal to reduce the height of the building were negotiated with the agent during the course of the application.  However, the resultant height of the extension was considered at detailed assessment stage to still be unacceptable.  Further significant alteration would have been required to bring the development within the realms of acceptability so it was decided to proceed to determine the application."
