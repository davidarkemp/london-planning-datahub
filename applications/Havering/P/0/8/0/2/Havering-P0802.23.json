    "The proposed extensions, by reason of their height, bulk and mass, in particular the excessive width of the double storey rear extension, would not appear suitably subservient to the scale of the existing dwelling. Furthermore, the extensions, by reason of their bulk and proximity to the side boundaries of the site would appear as unacceptably dominant and visually intrusive features in relation to the host dwelling and within the wider street scene. As such, the extensions would be unacceptably harmful to the appearance of the both the host dwelling and the surrounding area contrary to Policies 7 and 26 of the Havering Local Plan and the Council's Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD.",
