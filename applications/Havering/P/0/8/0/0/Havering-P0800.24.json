    "The development to which this permission relates must be commenced not later than three years from the date of this permission.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To comply with the requirements of Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended by Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004).",
    "The development hereby permitted shall not be carried out otherwise than in complete accordance with the approved plans (as set out on page one of this decision notice).",
    "Reason:-",
    "For the avoidance of doubt and to ensure that the development is carried out as approved.",
    "Prior to the first residential occupation of the development hereby approved, details of secure cycle storage shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority. The cycle storage shall be provided in accordance with the approved details prior to first occupation and permanently retained thereafter.",
    "Reason:-",
    "Insufficient information has been supplied with the application to demonstrate what facilities will be available for cycle parking.  Submission of this detail prior to occupation in the case of new building works or prior to the use commencing in the case of changes of use is in the interests of providing a wide range of facilities for non-motor car residents and sustainability.",
    "Before any air or ground source heat pump is commissioned, a report under the provisions of the Microgeneration Installation Standard: MCs 020 shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority to determine if the equipment would be deemed permitted development, or a full planning application will be required.",
    "Reason: To protect the amenity of noise sensitive premises from noise from mechanical plant.",
    "The ceiling/party floor insulation between the commercial and residential premises should be checked to ensure it complies with the current Approved Document E of the Building Regulations 1984 and to ensure that the occupiers are provided with reasonable resting/sleeping conditions with reference to British Standard BS8233:2014 - Sound insultation and noise reduction for buildings - Code of practice.",
    "The scheme shall be designed to be 5dB better than that given in Approved Document E 2010.",
    "If it is found that the partition does not comply with the regulations, it should be upgraded to comply with the regulations, as a minimum.",
    "The details of any works are to be submitted  to and approved by the Local Authority before the premises are occupied.",
    "The sound insulation and noise control measures shall be carried out strictly in accordance with the details so approved and shall be maintained as such thereafter. The insulation and measures shall be implemented prior to the first occu",
    "Prior to the commencement of any development an assessment shall be undertaken of the impact of noise emanating from the local environment, including (but not exclusively) the local transport network and any ventilation and extract systems from local businesses upon the development, both internally and in the external amenity space.",
    "Reference should be made to the \"good\" standard to be found in the World Health Organisation Guidelines for Community Noise 1999 and BS8233:2014 Guidance on Sound Insulation and Noise Reduction for Buildings, as well as BS4142:2014 + A1:2019 \"Methods for rating and assessing industrial and commercial sound\". Reference should also be made to the Acoustics Ventilation & Overheating Residential Design Guide 2020.",
    "Following this, a scheme detailing measures, which are to protect occupants from environmental noise shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority. It shall be implemented and validated prior to occupation.",
    "Reas",
    "The acoustic design and performance of the private amenity spaces within the development shall be agreed in writing with the Local Authority before construction commences. The design and construction of these areas shall provide the performance for private and communal external amenity spaces with reference to British Standard BS8233:2014 - Guidance on Sound Insulation and Noise Reduction for buildings - Code of practice. This may necessitate the developer to employ a suitably qualified acoustics consultant to carry out any necessary survey and provide recommendations.",
    "If the design of these areas cannot meet the recommended levels, due to the excessive noise climate, alternative amenity spaces for those areas affected should be provided which meet the  criteria within BS8233:2014 and agreed in writing with the Local Authority before development commences.",
    "Reason: To protect the occupiers of the properties constructed from excessive noise levels from the local environment in extern",
    "Pursuant to condition 7 above, the development shall not be occupied until full details of the proposed external amenity area have been submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority.  This shall include the submission of details pertaining to the design, height and siting of proposed privacy screening.  The approved details shall be implemented prior to first occupation and maintained permanently thereafter in accordance with the approved plans.",
    "Reason: To protect the occupiers of the properties constructed from excessive noise levels from the local environment in external amenity spaces and to maintain privacy and amenity for future occupiers and occupiers of neighbouring property.",
    "No building shall be occupied or use commenced until refuse and recycling facilities are provided in accordance with details which shall previously have been submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority. The refuse and recycling facilities shall be permanently retained thereafter.",
    "Reason:-",
    "Insufficient information has been supplied with the application to judge how refuse and recycling will be managed on site.  Submission of this detail prior to occupation in the case of new building works or prior to the use commencing in the case of changes of use will protect the amenity of occupiers of the development and also the locality generally.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35(2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management) Order 2015: No significant problems were identified during the consideration of the application, and therefore it has been determined in accordance with paragraph 38 of the National Planning Policy Framework."
