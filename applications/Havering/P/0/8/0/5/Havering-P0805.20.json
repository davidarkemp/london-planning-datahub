    "The proposed extension would, by reason of its forward projection beyond the established front building line of the terrace, form an incongruous and visually intrusive feature on this prominent corner site, detrimental to the character and appearance of this terrace and the visual amenity of the surrounding area.  The extension due to its forward projection and close proximity to the shared boundary with no.123 North Hill Drive would have an overbearing impact on the occupiers amenity.  The proposals would be contrary to the NPPF, policies 7.4 and 7.6 of The London Plan (2016), Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD and the Council's Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD 2011.",
