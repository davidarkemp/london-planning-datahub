    "The development to which this permission relates must be commenced not later than three years from the date of this permission.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To comply with the requirements of Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended by Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004).",
    "The development hereby permitted shall not be carried out otherwise than in complete accordance with the approved plans (as set out on page one of this decision notice).",
    "Reason:-",
    "For the avoidance of doubt and to ensure that the development is carried out as approved.",
    "Prior to commencement of the development hereby approved an area for a safe zone, in the form of yellow criss-cross lines (similar to National Highway Code  Yellow 'box junctions') shall be painted on the areas immediately to the front the doors hereby approved to a depth of 1m and the markings shall be maintained as such thereafter.",
    "Reason;",
    "To ensure the safety of pedestrians exiting from the doors hereby approved in the rear addition.",
    "All building operations in connection with the construction of external walls or other external site works; works involving the use of plant or machinery; the erection of scaffolding; the delivery of materials; the removal of materials and spoil from the site, and the playing of amplified music shall only take place between the hours of 8.00am and 6.00pm Monday to Friday, and between 8.00am and 1.00pm on Saturdays and not at all on Sundays and Bank Holidays/Public Holidays.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To protect residential amenity.",
    "Waste and recycling sacks will need to be presented by 7am on the boundary of the property facing Victoria Road on the scheduled collection day.",
    "Reason; To ensure the waste are collected from the premises.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35(2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management) Order 2015: No significant problems were identified during the consideration of the application, and therefore it has been determined in accordance with paragraph 38 of the National Planning Policy Framework.",
    "This planning permission does not remove the need to obtain any separate consent of the owner of the adjoining property prior to commencing building works on, under, above or immediately adjacent to their property (e.g. foundations or guttering). The Party Wall Etc. Act 1996 contains requirements to serve notice on adjoining owners of property under certain circumstances, and a procedure exists for resolving disputes. This is a matter of civil law between the two parties, and the Local Planning Authority are not involved in such matters.",
    "A free guide called \"The Party Wall Etc Act 1996: Explanatory Booklet\" is available on the website of the Department for Communities and Local Government.",
    "https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-party-wall-etc-act-1996-revised-explanatory-booklet",
    "This scheme has been considered with respect to the proposed physical alterations only. The space is currently used for storage ancillary to the commercial premises (as specifically stated in the applicants covering letter) and the application has been considered on this basis.  Any proposed future alternative use of the building may require planning permission or it would be for the applicant to demonstrate, potentially through an application for a Certificate of Lawful Use, that an alternative use would not require planning permission."
