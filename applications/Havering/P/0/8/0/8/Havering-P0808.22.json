    "The site is within the area identified in the Metropolitan Green Belt.  The Government Guidance as set out in the NPPF is that in order to achieve the purposes of the Metropolitan Green Belt it is essential to retain and protect the existing rural character of the area so allocated and that the new development will only be permitted outside the existing built up areas in the most exceptional circumstances.  No special circumstances have been submitted in this case and the proposal would also have a significant  adverse impact on the openness of the Green Belt given it prominent position and is therefore contrary to the NPPF and Policy G2 of the London Plan.",
