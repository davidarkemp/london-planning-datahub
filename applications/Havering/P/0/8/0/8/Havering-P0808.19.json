    "The proposed layout of the development would be inadequate resulting in substandard accommodation for future residents through insufficient space and the lack of provision of built-in storage. The proposed subdivision would not provide a satisfactory standard of accommodation for future occupiers due to the poor outlook and lack of light available to the ground floor flat as well as the cramped contrived room layout on the first floor. As a result, the development is contrary to Policy DC4 and Policy DC61 of the 2008 Havering Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document of the London Borough of Havering's LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD, the DCLG Technical Housing Standards March 2015, the London Plan, and the Housing SPG 2016.",
    "The proposed development would, by reason of the lack of provision of amenity space for the first floor flat create a development to the detriment of the amenity of occupiers. The development is therefore contrary to the Residential Design SPD 2010 and Policy DC2, DC3 DC4 and DC61 of the London Borough of Havering's LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD and Policy 3.5 of the London Plan.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to the agent in writing 10-09-19"
