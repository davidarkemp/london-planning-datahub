    "The proposal would by reason of its bulk, scale, layout and independent use be an incongruous feature at the rear of the garden. As such it would appear as an uncharacteristic intrusion into open garden space, being a visually disruptive addition and against the pattern of the development in the local area. It would also result in noise and disturbance to the detriment of amenity contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD and the advice given in the NPPF which states that new development should conserve and enhance local character and respect the surrounding built environment, respond to local character and add to the overall qualities of an area.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, it was necessary to issue a decision as close to the statutory timeframe as possible as opposed to seeking amendments which would have significantly delayed the application."
