    "The proposal would provide inadequate parking for the new dwellings leading to an increased demand for on-street parking in the area to the detriment of the safety and functioning of the highway contrary to Policy 24 and 26 of the Havering Local Plan and Policy T6 of the London Plan.",
    "The proposed development would, by reason of its positioning, orientation and proximity to the nearby property at no.153 Clockhouse Lane, in particular the first floor habitable room, would allow overlooking of the rear garden of the adjoining property and result in an unreasonable loss of privacy to the occupiers; additionally, there would be potential loss of privacy to future occupiers of the new dwellings due to design, proximity and orientation in relation to the raised patio area of no.3 Silvermere Avenue contrary to Policy 7 of the Havering Local Plan and the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document.",
