    "The site is within the Metropolitan Green Belt and the proposed development would not align with any of the relevant exceptions set out in Section 13 of the NPPF and would therefore comprise of inappropriate development. The provision of dwellings in the arrangement and massing shown would have a demonstrable impact on the open character of the Green Belt over that of the existing arrangement of built form and would represent an unwelcome urbanisation of the site. In the absence of any Very Special Circumstances which would outweigh the harm of inappropriateness and harm to openness the proposed development is unacceptable in principle and in contrast to the objectives of the NPPF including the purposes of including land within the Green Belt and Policy G2 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "Tthe design approach and massing of the development throughout would give rise to a suburban appearance out of keeping with prevailing patterns of development and the immediate context. The development therefore fails to reflect the character of the surrounding area  and does not respond adequately to the contraints of the site. The visual impression of the site as a result of the development would be wholly removed from the existing arrangement and there is a sense that the arrangement of the development through the massing of the dwellings and their concept would represent an unwelcome urbanisation of the site and one which fails to reflect prevailing character. The development would conflict with the objectives of Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 Policy 26, the London Plan and the Framework in particular Paragraph 130 which requires development is sympathetic to local character and establish or maintain a strong sense of place.",
    "The proposed development in particular the north facing row of dwellings would form a visually intrusive and overbearing feature from the adjoining site and would give rise to a sense of being overlooked inconsistent wtih established local character and existing relationships. The development is therefore regarded as being unneighbourly  and also prejudicial to the redevelopment of adjoining sites thereby contrary to Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 Policies 7 and 34, the London Plan and the Framework in particular Para 130 which requires development provide a high standard of amenity for existing and future users.",
    "The proposals show an overprovision of parking inconsistent with the objectives of the Havering Local Plan 2016-2031  and furthermore fails to demonstrate that the site could be serviced adequately by larger vehicles, in particular in relation to waste collection/management. The development is in the absence of evidence otherwise contrary to the objectives of Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 Policy 24.",
    "All developments of 10 or more dwellings or residential developments with a site area of more than 1,000 sq m are required to provide at least 35% affordable housing based on habitable rooms (gross). The site area is in excess of 1000 sqm and the applicant has failed to provide any reasoned justification as to why no affordable housing has been provided. In the absence of any means to secure provision of affordable housing, such as through a legal agreement or measures to mitigate or adequately justify the lack of on site provision the proposal is contrary Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 Policy 4.",
    "The proposal, if granted planning permission on appeal, would be liable for the Mayor of London and Havering Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). Based upon the information supplied with the application, the Mayoral CIL payable would be  £12,425 based on the calculation of £25.00 per square metre and the Havering Community Infrastructure Levy (HCIL) would be a charge of £62,125 based on calculation of £125 per square metre. Each would be subject to indexation.",
