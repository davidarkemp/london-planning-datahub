    "The roof alteration to the host dwelling, as a result of the hip to gable roof conversion, is not subservient to the roof of the property because it alters the basic shape of the roof on the semi-detached property which is unacceptable as it imbalances the pair through a bulky roof form to one half causing a negative effect on the street scene by the loss of symmetry. Accordingly the roof alteration undertaken is of a poor quality design and contrary to the purposes and intent of Local Plan Policies 7 and 26 and the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document.",
    "The rear dormer window in-situ, by reason of its bulk, scale, mass and inappropriate use of materials, appears as a dominant and visually intrusive feature detrimental to the character and appearance of the host property and visual amenity of the rear garden environment, contrary to Local Plan Policies 7 and 26 of the Havering Local Plan and the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document.",
