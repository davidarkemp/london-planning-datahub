In the event that this occurs, it is advised that the developer stops work immediately and seeks the advice of the local authority ecologist and/or the relevant statutory nature conservation organisation (e.g. Natural England). Developers should note that it is a criminal offence to deliberately kill, injure or capture bats, or to deliberately disturb them or to damage or destroy their breeding sites and resting places (roosts).
