    "The proposed dwelling due to its site layout would form an incongruous and visually cramped form of development at odds with surrounding character.  The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policies 7,10 and 26 of the Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 and also the guidance within the NPPF which requires fundamentally that development add to the overall quality of the area whilst also establishing or maintaining a strong sense of place.",
    "The proposed layout of the development would be inadequate resulting in substandard accommodation for future residents through lack of internal space and internal head height. As a result, the development represents an overdevelopment of the site contrary to Policy 7 of the Havering Local Plan, Policy D6 of the London Plan and NPPF.",
    "The proposed development would result in living conditions that do not create a suitably high quality living environment for future occupiers. The constraints of the site in conjunction with the design approach adopted would be to the detriment of the amenity of future occupiers. The constrained plot and arrangement of living accommodation resulting in poor aspect, outlook with the habitable room windows in close proximity of the boundary to with the access road Albyns Farm and noise related issues from passing vehicles, would be substandard and give rise to an overwhelming sense of enclosure and impact on enjoyment of the dwelling, in direct contrast to the aims of Policies 7 and 10 of the Havering Local Plan, Policy D6 of the London Plan 2021 and NPPF.",
    "The proposed parking for the donor property and new residential unit would by reason of the inadequate manoeuvring space would be likely to result in a vehicles will likely be egressing these spaces in a reverse gear for approximately 26m before entering the carriageway which would raise a safety concern and be to the detriment of highway safety and pedestrian movement contrary to the aims and objectives of Policies 23 and 24 of the Havering Local Plan and Policies T4 and T6.1 of the London Plan.",

This charge has been levied under s.206 of the Planning Act 2008 and includes both the Mayor of London's CIL and Havering Council's CIL.",
