    "The proposed development would, by reason of its bulk, design, appearance and siting, fail to integrate acceptably with the host dwelling and would appear as an anomaly within the wider street scene. Readily visible from such a prominent location, this development would be visually intrusive, and out of scale and character with the established pattern of development in the surrounding environment. It is therefore harmful to the appearance of the site and surrounding area contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD.",
    "The proposed dwelling in addition with the existing extension would, by reason of its excessive width, scale and position close to the boundaries of the site, be an intrusive and unneighbourly development as well as having visual impact on the amenity of surrounding area contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD.",
    "The proposed development, by reason of its inadequate internal floorspace standards would be constrained, providing a sub-standard residential accommodation for future occupiers which would adversely impact on their living condition, contrary to the aims and objectives of London Plan Policy D6 and Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD.",
    "The proposal, if granted planning permission on appeal, would be liable for the Council and the Mayor of London Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). Based upon the information supplied with the application, the CIL payable would be £9,900. Further details with regard to CIL are available from the Council's website.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, it was necessary to issue a decision as close to the statutory timeframe as possible as opposed to seeking amendments which would have significantly delayed the application."
