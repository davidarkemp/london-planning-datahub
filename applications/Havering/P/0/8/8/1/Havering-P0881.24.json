    "The proposed linked extension to the stable block would, by reason of its scale, length and siting, be harmful to its special architectural interest and this structure would detract from its symmetric form, individuality and character as a purpose-built, Grade II listed stable block, contrary to Policies 26 and 28 of the Havering Local Plan, Policy HC1 of the London Plan and the guidance contained in the National Planning Policy Framework.",
    "Enclosing the existing open courtyard of the stable block with an internal structure would, by reason of its scale, siting and materials, be harmful to its architectural character and special interest, appear incongruous, be unsympathetic and detract from the significant architectural character and setting of this Grade II listed building, contrary to Policies 26 and 28 of the Havering Local Plan, Policy HC1 of the London Plan and the guidance contained in the National Planning Policy Framework.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to Stephen George & Partners via email on 13th September 2024.",
    "The proposal, if granted planning permission on appeal, would be liable for the Mayor of London and Havering Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). Based upon the information supplied with the application, the Mayoral CIL payable would be £4,325 based on the calculation of £25.00 per square metre and the Havering Community Infrastructure Levy (HCIL) would be a charge of £21,625 based on calculation of £125 per square metre. Each would be subject to indexation.",
