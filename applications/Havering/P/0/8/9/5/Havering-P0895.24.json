    "The proposed flats would fail to provide acceptable standard of accommodation, due to poor level of access with noise and disturbance from the shared access door and stairs with the users of the first floor commercial premises, which would adversely impact on the living condition of the existing and future occupiers of the premises, and would be contrary to the Local Plan Policies 7 and 26 and London Plan Policy D6.",
    "In the absence of sufficient information regarding the layout at the second floor level, it has not been demonstrated that, the proposed walkway with planting would not adversely impact on the residential amenity of the existing occupiers at the second floor level, in terms of outlook and privacy, the proposals would therefore unacceptably impact on the living condition of the occupiers, contrary to Local Plan Policies 7 and 26, London Plan policy D6 and the NPPF (2023).",
    "Based on the level of information submitted with the application, the proposed facade alterations, by reason of its prominent location, inadequate materiality and detailed design, would unacceptably detract from the character and appearance of the application premises, to the detriment of the street-scene, and is therefore contrary to Policies 7 and 26 of the Local Plan, London Plan Policy D4 and the NPPF 2023.",
    "The proposals would, by reason of its reconfiguration at the second floor level result in the provision of a substandard level of accommodation with inadequate internal floor space which would be contrary to the aims and objectives of the London Plan Policy D6 and the Nationally Described Space Standard (NDSS).",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, it was necessary to issue a decision as close to the statutory timeframe as possible as opposed to seeking amendments which would have significantly delayed the application. Reasons for refusal was sent to the agent via email on 12/09/2024.",
    "The proposal, if granted planning permission on appeal, would be liable for a Mayoral and Havering Community Infrastructure Levy payment as it would create five additional residential units and would add a net additional 399sqm of residential floor space.",
    "Therefore the proposal would incur a charge of £8,675 and £43,375 based on the calculation of £25 per square metre and £125 per square metre, subject to indexation."
