    "The proposed two storey side extension by reason of its lack of set back at first floor level from the original front elevation fails to be subservient in design and so is detrimental to the character and appearance of the host property and visual amenity of the streetscene, contrary to policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Controls Policies Development Plan Document (adopted 2008) and the Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD (adopted 2011).",
    "The proposed side extension by reason of its excessive depth, bulk and scale close to the common boundary, would result in an overbearing development that would have significant and undue impacts on the amenities enjoyed by the neighbour at no. 10 Springbank Avenue including a sense of enclosure, as well as overshadowing and loss of sunlight/daylight to habitable rooms, contrary to policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Controls Policies Development Plan Document (adopted 2008) and the Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD (adopted 2011).",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal for it was given to Mr Saddam Kurd (agent), via email on 24 August 2020."
