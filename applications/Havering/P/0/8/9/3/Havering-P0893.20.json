    "The proposed development would, by reason of its design fronting Hayburn Way appear as a visually incongruous feature in the streetscene harmful to the prevailing pattern of development along Upper Rainham Road, contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD",
    "The proposed development would, by reason of the siting, design and intensity of the development and proximity to neighbouring properties cause overlooking and loss of privacy which would have a serious and adverse effect on the living conditions of adjacent occupiers, contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD.",
    "The proposed development would, by reason of the inadequately dimensioned on site car parking provision, result in unacceptable obstruction of the public footway compromising pedestrian and road safety, contrary to Policy DC 33 of the Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD.",
    "The proposal, if granted planning permission on appeal, would be liable for the Mayor of London and Havering Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). Based upon the information supplied with the application, the CIL payable would be Â£9,700 and %48,500 (subject to indexation).",
