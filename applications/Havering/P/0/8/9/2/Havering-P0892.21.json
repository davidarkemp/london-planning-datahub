    "The proposals would result in the loss of Use Class B8 floor space on a non-designated industrial site which would harm the long term economic prospects of the Borough. The proposals are therefore contrary to policy CP3 of the Havering Core Strategy and Development Control Policies and Development Plan Document (2008), Draft Local Plan Policy 20 and London Plan policy E7.",
    "The ground floor flats would be single aspect and have poor outlook and due to their long narrow layout and would in the absence of information to demonstrate otherwise receive unacceptable levels of daylight and poor passive ventilation. The ground floor window of Flat 1 would fail to have a privacy buffer with the street and future occupiers would rely on blinds/curtains to maintain privacy within resulting in a dark oppressive living environment within this flat. The proposals are contrary to policy DC3 of the Havering Core Strategy and Development Control Policies and Development Plan Document (2008), Draft Local Plan Policy 7 and London Plan policy D6.",
    "The position of the window of the single aspect Flat 1 would be positioned directly next to the entrance to the commercial unit and may result in noise impacts to this flat which may place unreasonable restrictions on the use and impact on the future viability of this unit. The proposals are contrary to policy DC3 of the Havering Core Strategy and Development Control Policies and Development Plan Document (2008), Draft Local Plan Policy 7 and London Plan policies D6 and D13.",
    "In the absence of appropriate balcony screening to include 1.7m high obscure glazed sides and the inclusion of upper floor side windows, the development would prejudice future development on the adjoining plot currently occupied by a single storey supermarket and therefore contrary to policy DC61 of the Havering Core Strategy and Development Control Policies and Development Plan Document (2008), Draft Local Plan Policy 7 and London Plan policies D3 and D4.",
    "The proposed development would fail to provide any family sized units and the proposed dwelling mix would not comply with the Councils recommended dwelling mix. The proposals are therefore contrary to Draft Local Plan policy 5 and London Plan policy H10.",
    "The proposed layout and design of the residential communal entrance door from Mawney Road would fail to provide a prominent, generous and secure access for residents and the position of the front forecourt parking together with the location of the refuse store would create a cramped layout and appear visually dominant within the street scene and fail to compliment or improve the visual amenity and character of the area contrary to Policies D40, D61 and D63 of the Council's Development Plan Document (DPD), policies 26, 27 and 35 of the Draft Local Plan, policies D3,D4, D5, D6, D8 and D11 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "The development would result in an overprovision of general car parking and would exceed the maximum parking standards set out in the London Plan failing to promote sustainable travel and reduce car dominance and act as a discouragement to using public transport. The proposals are contrary to policy DC33 of the Havering Core Strategy and Development Control Policies and Development Plan Document (2008), Draft Local Plan Policy 24 and London Plan (2021) policies T2, T6 and T6.1.",
    "In the absence of detailed contextual elevations and a daylight and sunlight report to demonstrate otherwise the proposed increase in scale, bulk and massing along the boundary with No. 17 is considered to result an unacceptable impact on outlook and loss of daylight and sunlight to the upper floor windows and overshadowing of the rear garden of No. 17 contrary to policy D61 of the Havering Core Strategy and Development Control Policies and Development Plan Document (2008), Draft Local Plan Policy 7 and London Plan policy D3 and D4.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to the agent in writing 02-08-2021.",
