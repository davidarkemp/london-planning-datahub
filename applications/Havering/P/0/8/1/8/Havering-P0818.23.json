    "The proposal fails to provide sufficient detailed information regarding the type/nature of both the existing and the proposed uses, and the exact type of operation. In the absence of such information, by reasons of the nature of the proposal, the potential intensity of noise and activity, potential disturbance, parking, manoeuvring, access and waiting requirements of vehicles visiting the site, create unacceptable level of disturbance, arising from vehicle movements, and the general activities and processes associated with this use, which would be detrimental to the nearby residents and the area, contrary to policies 7, 19, 24 and 26 of the Havering Local Plan 2021.",
    "In the absence of adequate information regarding the existing and the proposed uses, the proposal would, by reasons of increased activity and demand for parking, together with the likely overspill impacts of vehicles waiting and parking on the street, result in harm to the functioning of the highway and creates conditions detrimental to amenity of nearby residents.  The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies 7, 19, 24 and 26 of the Havering Local Plan 2021.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: In accordance with paragraph 38 of the National Planning Policy Framework, detailed information and plans required to make a full assessment of the proposal were negotiated with Martin Parrish via email on 5.6.23. The applicant and agent declined to offer this information and details."
