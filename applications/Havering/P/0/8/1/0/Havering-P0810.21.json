    "The proposed extension would through its scale, bulk and mass and position forward of the building line of adjacent premises, erode the spacious character present through closing down the space between the flank elevation and back-edge of the foot-way. It would therefore be harmful to the character and appearance of the area and prevailing pattern of development contrary to the Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD 2011,  Policy DC61 of the London Borough of Havering LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD 2008 and London Plan 2021 Policy D4. In addition there would be conflict with the NPPF (the Framework) specifically Para 127  which states that developments should function well, add to the overall quality of the area and be sympathetic to local character.",
