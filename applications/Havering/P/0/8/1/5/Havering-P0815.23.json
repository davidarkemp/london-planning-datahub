    "The proposed development by reason of its scale, mass and in particular its siting to the front of the building would appear as an incongruous and visually intrusive feature dominating the front of the host and approved dwellings, harmful to street-scene and would not be in keeping with the character and appearance of the building or the surrounding area within the Emerson Park contrary to Policy 26 of the Local Plan and the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document Adopted 2011.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, it was necessary to issue a decision as close to the statutory timeframe as possible as opposed to seeking amendments which would have significantly delayed the application.",
    "The proposal, if granted planning permission on appeal, would be liable for both the Mayor of London Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and the Havering Council's Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). Based upon the information supplied with the application, the CIL payable would be a total Â£275850.00. Further details with regard to CIL are available from the Council's website."
