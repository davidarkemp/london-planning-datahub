    "Due to the physical constraints of the layout of the existing outbuilding and proximity to the adjacent commercial uses the proposed conversion to a dwelling would fail to provide an adequate provision of private amenity space to a sufficient standard, to the detriment of future occupiers contrary to Policies 7, 10 and 26 of the Havering Local Plan and Policy D6 of the London Plan.",
    "The proposed dwelling, by reason of its proximity to neighbouring commercial uses and its design and layout, including the proximity of the kitchen, private amenity space and the second bedroom to areas used for vehicle storage would be likely to incur unreasonable adverse amenity impacts by reason of noise and disturbance and vehicular activity, leading to a poor quality living environment to the detriment of the amenity of future occupiers, contrary to Policy 7 of the Havering Local Plan.",
    "The proposed outbuilding conversion would result in a dwelling, that by reason of its siting, layout, design and configuration would not  provide adequate outlook for the proposed rear habitable rooms specifically the kitchen and second bedroom and would fail to provide an acceptable degree of amenity for future occupants contrary to Policies 7, 26 of the Havering Local Plan and Policy D6 of the London Plan.",
    "The proposed development would, by reason of the inadequate on site car parking provision, result in unacceptable overspill onto the adjoining roads to the detriment of highway safety and residential amenity contrary to Policy 24 of the Havering Local Plan.",
