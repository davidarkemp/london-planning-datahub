    "The original dwelling had a gross internal floor space of less than 120 square metres prior to conversion. The existing flat to be converted has a gross internal floor space of approximately 66.5 square metres which fails to meet the standard of 120 square metres and through the loss of the existing three bedroom first floor flat results in the  unacceptable loss of much needed larger family homes within the Borough, contrary to Policy 8(i) of the Havering Local Plan 2021.",
    "The communal area within the roof of the accommodation would not be of sufficiently high quality and would be detrimental to the amenity of future occupiers. Through its size and shape and location within the roof it would feel cramped with limited useable space available for furniture and appliances which might be expected in a communal setting. Given this and the lack of any alternative communal space, including any outdoor amenity area, the proposals are therefore in conflict with the objectives of Policy 8(vi) of the Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 which requires large enough for all the dwelling's occupants to use simultaneously and the East London HMO Guidance, Policy 8(vii) which requires that the shape of the room be taken into consideration, not only the floor area.",
    "The proposals fail to demonstrate adequate levels of parking. The proposed use would fail to make adequate provision for both the proposed HMO and retained self-contained flat. The nature of the HMO use by unrelated occupants combined with the level of occupancy of the ground floor flat is considered likely to lead to increased vehicle ownership and overspill which would contribute unacceptably to existing levels of parking stress and limited on-street spaces within the locality to the detriment of the amenity of surrounding occupiers. The absence of any compelling evidence otherwise, such as a parking stress survey, means that it has not been demonstrated that there would not be conflict with Policy 8, London Plan T6 and Para 115 of the Framework.",
    "The proposed cycle and refuse storage areas in the front garden are considered likely to adversely impact visibility for drivers accessing the site, to the detriment of highway safety and pedestrian safety and comfort. Accordingly it has not been demonstrated that there would not be conflict with Policy 8, London Plan T6 and Para 115 of the Framework.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to the agent in writing 15 August 2024."
