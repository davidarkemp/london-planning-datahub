    "The proposals should provide a 2.1 by 2.1 metre pedestrian visibility splay on either side of the proposed access, set back to the boundary of the public footway.  There should be no obstruction or object higher than 0.6 metres within the visibility splay.",
    "Reason:-",

    "- Planning approval does not constitute approval for changes to the public highway. Highway Authority approval will only be given after suitable details have been submitted considered and agreed. If new or amended access is required (whether temporary or permanent), there may be a requirement for the diversion or protection of third party utility plant or highway authority assets and it is recommended that early involvement with the relevant statutory undertaker takes place. The applicant must contact Engineering Services to discuss the scheme and commence the relevant highway approvals process. Please note that unauthorised work on the highway is an offence.",
