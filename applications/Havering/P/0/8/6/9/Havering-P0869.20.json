    "The proposed rear dormer window, by reason of the width, bulk and massing would occupy an unacceptably large area of the rear roof slope,  forming a dominant, incongruous and visually intrusive feature, detrimental to the character and appearance of the property and materially harmful to the visual amenity of the surrounding area contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document, the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document and Policy 7.4 of the London Plan.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: In accordance with paragraph 38 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2019, improvements required to make the proposal acceptable were requested from the agent of the applicant on 12 August 2020.  The revisions involved reduction in the size of the proposed dormer but these were not received at time of writing."
