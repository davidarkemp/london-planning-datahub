    "The proposed side dormers would, by reason of their design and excessive bulk appear out of scale and character with the existing dwelling. They would appear as a visually intrusive form of development from the perspective of the wider street scene materially harmful to the character of the host dwelling and the surrounding area contrary to Policies 7 & 26 of the Havering Local Plan and the Council's Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD (2011).",
    "The proposed side dormer would, by reason of its position and proximity to the common boundary to No. 51 Gordon Avenue significantly reduce the availability of light into a habitable room window along the adjacent flank wall which would have a serious and adverse effect on the living conditions of adjacent occupiers of this property contrary to Policy 7 of the Havering Local Plan and the Council's Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to the agent via email on 07/08/2024."
