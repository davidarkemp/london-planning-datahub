    "Reason:-",
    "For the avoidance of doubt and to ensure that the development is carried out as approved.",

Such scheme shall contain details of the erection and maintenance of fences or walls around the trees, details of underground measures to protect roots, the control of areas around the trees and any other measures necessary for the protection of the trees.
