    "The proposal would, by reason of its scale and proximity to the neighbouring property no.63 Shepherds Hill, be an intrusive, overbearing and unneighbourly development that would have a significant adverse effect on the amenities of these adjacent occupiers contrary to Policy 7 of the Havering Local Plan and the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document.",
    "The site is within the area identified in the Local Plan as Metropolitan Green Belt. The Local Plan, as well as the London Plan and the Guidance Given in the National Planning Policy Framework emphasise that in order to achieve the purposes of the Metropolitan Green Belt it is essential to retain and protect the existing rural character of the area so allocated and that the new development will only be permitted outside the existing built up areas in the most exceptional circumstances. The proposed side / rear extension would, by reason of its bulk and mass, create disproportionate additions over and above the size of the original building and would be harmful to the appearance and openness of the surrounding area and the Green Belt contrary to London Policy G2, and Policies 7 and 26 of the Havering Local Plan, the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document and Chapter 13 of the NPPF.",
    "The proposal by reason of its bulk, mass and design would not appear suitably subservient to the scale of the existing dwelling and it would appear as a dominant and bulky feature in the immediate street scene contrary to Policies 7 and 26 of the Havering Local Plan and the Council's Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, it was necessary to issue a decision as close to the statutory timeframe as possible as opposed to seeking amendments which would have significantly delayed the application."
