    "The proposed introduction of a detached dwelling, with its cramped and convoluted access arrangement, within the rear garden would give rise to a form of development which is out of character with the prevailing generous landscaped rear garden environment. The proposal would have poor access and would take up a significant portion of landscaped gardens, with loss of two existing ancillary outbuildings. The proposed subdivision of the rear garden and formation of a new dwelling would fail to be in keeping with the character of the area.  The proposed development therefore conflicts with Policies 7, 10, 26 and 27 of the Local Plan and Policy D3 of the London Plan, 2021. Taken together, these policies and guidance seek to ensure that development is of a high quality design and respects the distinctive qualities, identity, and character of the area and seeks to ensure the development on garden and backland sites does not adversely harm the character of an area. It would also conflict with",
    "The proposed development, with respect to the access arrangements and cycle provision and the consequent loss of private amenity space, and resulting unacceptable overlooking onto the existing garden flats and loss of privacy would significantly detract from the amenities of the occupiers of the existing dwellings in the host building. The proposed development therefore conflicts with Policies Policy 10 and policy 7 of the Local Plan and Policy D3 of the London Plan, 2021 and NPPF 23. Taken together, these policies and guidance seek to ensure that development would not adversely affect the amenities of the neighbouring occupies.",
    "The proposed development would, by reason of poor outlook and unsatisfactory access to the residential unit give rise to a poor quality of accommodation for the future occupiers of the site contrary to Local Plan Policies 7, 10 and 27 and  policy D6 of London Plan 2021 and advice given in the NPPF.",
