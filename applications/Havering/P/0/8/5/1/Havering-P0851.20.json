  "decision_conditions": [
    "There is no effective control or mechanism to prevent the existing or the future occupiers of the Verve Apartments (ground, first, second and the third floor) from obtaining parking permits in the Residential Control Parking Zone and as result of the loss of 33 car parking spaces which are meant to be available to them, there would be a significantly increased risk of on-street car parking demand and the over-spill of the cars onto the existing heavily park roads resulting in a detrimental impact upon the safe and free flow of traffic in the control parking zone  and consequential detriment to the amenities of the existing residents, thereby the proposal fails to satisfactorily mitigate the parking impacts of the development, contrary to the provisions of Policy 24 of the local plan (2016-2031) adopted 2021."
