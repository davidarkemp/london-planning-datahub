    "The development hereby permitted shall not be carried out otherwise than in complete accordance with the approved plans (as set out on page one of this decision notice).",
    "Reason:-",
    "The Local Planning Authority consider it essential that the whole of the development is carried out and that no departure whatsoever is made from the details approved, since the development would not necessarily be acceptable if partly carried out or carried out differently in any degree from the details submitted.  Also, in order that the development accords with Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policy DC61.",
    "The external elevations of the property which are currently pink in colour shall be repainted using Sandtex Ultra Smooth Masonry Paint - Chalk Hill and not any other unless otherwise agreed in writing with the Local Planning Authority.",
