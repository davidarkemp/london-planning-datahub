    "The proposed layout of the development would be inadequate resulting in substandard accommodation for future residents through lack of internal space. As a result, the development represents an overdevelopment of the site contrary to Policy 7 of the Havering Local Plan and Policy D6 of the London Plan.",
    "The layout of the donor parking at the front of the property, by reason of noise, general disturbance and fumes associated with vehicles manoeuvring directly adjacent to the habitable room window of the new dwelling would be  detrimental to the amenity enjoyed by the occupiers of that property, contrary to Policy 7 of the Havering Local Plan.",

This charge has been levied under s.206 of the Planning Act 2008 and includes both the Mayor of London's CIL and Havering Council's CIL.",
