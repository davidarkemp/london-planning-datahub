  "description": "Erection of 5 new two-storey dwellings comprising 1 x 3-bed detached dwelling with accommodation in roof space; 2 pairs of semi detached dwellings (3 x 2-bed two with habitable rooms in roof spaces, and 1 x 1-bed) with associated parking and amenity space and installation of vehicular crossover to side involving demolition of existing nursing home.",

    "The proposed development would, by reason of its position, orientation and proximity to the neighbouring property cause overlooking and loss of privacy, particularly to the private rear garden amenity space, which would have a serious and adverse effect on the living conditions of adjacent occupiers, contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD.",
    "The proposed development would, by reason of the mass and design of the roof form of units 1 and 2, appear as an unacceptably dominant and visually intrusive and incongruous feature in the streetscene harmful to the appearance of the surrounding area and at odds with the local character, contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD.",
    "The private amenity spaces of the proposed development would, by reason of their poor design and configuration, result in a cramped and poor quality external living environmental that will be overlooked from communal spaces, adjacent amenity spaces and first floor habitable room windows, thereby compromising the usability and quality of the private amenity spaces to the detriment of future occupiers contrary to Policy DC61, the Residential Design SPD, London Plan Policy 3.5 and the Housing SPG. The proposal would also fail to accord with the core principle set out in Paragraph 127 of the National Planning Policy Framework which seeks to ensure a high standard of amenity for existing and future occupants of land and buildings.",
    "The proposed development would result in living conditions that do not create a suitably high quality living environment for future occupiers. The constraints of the site in conjunction with the design approach adopted would be to the detriment of the amenity of future occupiers. The proposed development fails to meet the minimum internal areas of the Nationally Described Space Standard resulting in undersized and cramped internal living conditions. The constrained plot and arrangement of living accommodation including provision of amenity space would be substandard and give rise to an overwhelming sense of enclosure in direct contrast to the aims of London Plan Policies 3.5, 7.4 and 7.6, Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide. The proposal would also fail to accord with the core principle set out in Paragraph 127 of the National Planning Policy Framework which seeks to ensure a",
