  "decision_conditions": [
    "The development to which this permission relates must be commenced not later than three years from the date of this permission.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To comply with the requirements of Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended by Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004).",
    "All new external finishes shall be carried out in materials to match those of the existing building(s) to the satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To safeguard the appearance of the premises and the character of the immediate area, and in order that the development accords with the Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policy DC61.",
    "The development hereby permitted shall not be carried out otherwise than in complete accordance with the approved plans (as set out on page one of this decision notice).",
    "Reason:-",
    "The Local Planning Authority consider it essential that the whole of the development is carried out and that no departure whatsoever is made from the details approved, since the development would not necessarily be acceptable if partly carried out or carried out differently in any degree from the details submitted.  Also, in order that the development accords with Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policy DC61.",
    "Notwithstanding the provisions of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015, no window or other opening (other than those shown on the submitted and approved plan,) shall be formed in the flank wall(s) of the building(s) hereby permitted, unless specific permission under the provisions of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 has first been sought and obtained in writing from the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:-",
    "In order to ensure a satisfactory development that will not result in any loss of privacy or damage to the environment of neighbouring properties which exist or may be proposed in the future, and in order that the development accords with Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policy DC61.",
    "All building operations in connection with the construction of external walls, roof, and foundations; site excavation or other external site works; works involving the use of plant or machinery; the erection of scaffolding; the delivery of materials; the removal of materials and spoil from the site, and the playing of amplified music shall only take place between the hours of 8.00am and 6.00pm Monday to Friday, and between 8.00am and 1.00pm on Saturdays and not at all on Sundays and Bank Holidays/Public Holidays.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To protect residential amenity, and in order that the development accords with the Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policy DC61.",
    "Prior to any above ground works, details of all proposed walls, fences and boundary treatment shall be submitted to, and approved in writing by, the Local Planning Authority.  The boundary development shall then be carried out in accordance with the approved details and retained permanently thereafter to the satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:",
    "Insufficient information has been supplied with the application to judge the appropriateness of any boundary treatment.  Submission of this detail prior to commencement will protect the visual amenities of the development, prevent undue overlooking of adjoining property and ensure that the development accords with the Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policy DC61.",
    "Before the building(s) hereby permitted is first occupied, the area set aside for car parking shall be laid out and surfaced to the satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority and retained permanently thereafter for the accommodation of vehicles visiting the site and shall not be used for any other purpose.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To ensure that car parking accommodation is made permanently available to the standards adopted by the Local Planning Authority in the interest of highway safety, and that the development accords with the Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policy DC33.",
    "No building shall be occupied or use commenced until refuse and recycling facilities are provided in accordance with details which shall previously have been submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority. The refuse and recycling facilities shall be permanently retained thereafter.",
    "Reason:-",
    "Insufficient information has been supplied with the application to judge how refuse and recycling will be managed on site.  Submission of this detail prior to occupation in the case of new building works or prior to the use commencing in the case of changes of use will protect the amenity of occupiers of the development and also the locality generally and ensure that the development accords with the Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policy DC61.",
    "No building shall be occupied or use commenced until cycle storage is provided in accordance with details previously submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority. The cycle storage shall be permanently retained thereafter.",
    "Reason:-",
    "Insufficient information has been supplied with the application to demonstrate what facilities will be available for cycle parking.  Submission of this detail prior to occupation in the case of new building works or prior to the use commencing in the case of changes of use is in the interests of providing a wide range of facilities for non-motor car residents and sustainability.",
    "Notwithstanding the provisions of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015, no window or other opening (other than those shown on the submitted and approved plan,) shall be formed in the flank wall(s) of the building(s) hereby permitted, unless specific permission under the provisions of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 has first been sought and obtained in writing from the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:-",
    "In order to ensure a satisfactory development that will not result in any loss of privacy or damage to the environment of neighbouring properties which exist or may be proposed in the future, and in order that the development accords with Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policy DC61.",
    "The dwelling hereby approved shall comply with Regulation 36 (2)(b) and Part G2 of the Building Regulations - Water Efficiency.",
    "Reason: In order to comply with Policy 5.15 of the London Plan.",

    "Planning approval does not constitute approval for changes to the public highway. Highway Authority approval will only be given after suitable details have been submitted considered and agreed. If new or amended access as required (whether temporary or permanent) there may be a requirement for the diversion or protection of third party utility plant and it is recommended that early involvement with the relevant statutory undertaker takes place. The applicant must contact Engineering Services on 01708 433751 to discuss the scheme and commence the relevant highway approvals process. please note that unauthorised work on the highway is an offence.",
    "The developer (including their representatives and contractors) is advised that planning consent does not discharge the requirements of the New Roads and Street Works Act 1991 and the Traffic Management Act 2004. Formal notifications and approval will be needed for any highway works (including temporary works of any nature) required during the construction of the development.",
    "Please note that unauthorised works on the highway is an offence.",
    "The developer is advised that if construction materials are proposed to be kept on the highway during construction works then they will need to apply for a license from the Council. If the developer requires scaffolding, hoarding or mobile cranes to be used on the highway, a license is required and Streetcare should be contacted on 01708 434343 to make the necessary arrangements.",
    "Please note that unauthorised works on the highway is an offence.",
    "The planning obligations recommended in this report have been subject to the statutory tests set out in Regulation 122 of the Community Infrastructure Levy Regulations 2010 and the obligations are considered to have satisfied the following criteria:-",
    "(a)\tNecessary to make the development acceptable in planning terms;",
    "(b)\tDirectly related to the development; and",
    "(c)\tFairly and reasonably related in scale and kind to the development.",
    "Before occupation of the residential/commercial unit(s) hereby approved, it is a requirement to have the property/properties officially Street Named and Numbered by our Street Naming and Numbering Team.  Official Street Naming and Numbering will ensure that that Council has record of the property/properties so that future occupants can access our services.
