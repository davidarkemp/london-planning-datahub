    "The resultant appearance of the dwelling through the cumulative impact of the extensions proposed including roof design would fail to be adequately informed by its surroundings which would be detrimental to the character and appearance of the Conservation Area through the formation of a dwelling type and detailing with little precedent. As such the development would fail to preserve the character or appearance of the Gidea Park Conservation Area. The development would conflict with Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 Policies 26 and 28 and the objectives of the NPPF. The development also fails to preserve or enhance the character and appearance of Gidea Park Conservation Area, therefore contrary to Section 72(1) of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990.",
