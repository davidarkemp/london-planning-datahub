    "The development to which this permission relates must be commenced not later than three years from the date of this permission.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To comply with the requirements of Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended by Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004).",
    "All new external finishes shall be carried out in materials to match those of the existing building(s) to the satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To safeguard the appearance of the premises and the character of the immediate area.",
    "The development hereby permitted shall not be carried out otherwise than in complete accordance with the approved plans (as set out on page one of this decision notice).",
    "Reason:-",
    "For the avoidance of doubt and to ensure that the development is carried out as approved.",
    "Notwithstanding the provisions of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015, no window or other opening (other than those shown on the submitted and approved plan,) shall be formed in the flank wall(s) of the building(s) hereby permitted, unless specific permission under the provisions of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 has first been sought and obtained in writing from the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:-",
    "In order to ensure a satisfactory development that will not result in any loss of privacy or damage to the environment of neighbouring properties which exist or may be proposed in the future.",
    "The proposed glazing in the side elevations of the extension shall be permanently glazed with obscure glass not less than Level 3 on the standard scale of obscurity and shall thereafter be maintained and permanently fixed shut.",
    "Reason:-",
    "In the interests of privacy.",
    "No building shall be occupied until the 1.7m high screen fencing is provided in accordance with details previously submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority. The fencing shall be permanently retained and maintained thereafter.",
    "Reason:-",
    "Insufficient information has been supplied with the application to judge the appropriateness of any boundary treatment.  Submission of this detail prior to occupation in the case of new building works or prior to the use commencing in the case of changes of use will protect the visual amenities of the development and prevent undue overlooking of adjoining property.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: In accordance with paragraph 38 of the National Planning Policy Framework, improvements required to make the proposal acceptable were negotiated with Colin Henderson via email on September 5th 2022. The revisions involved a reduction in the depth/height of the extension, a reduction in the depth of the raised patio and 1.7m high fencing alongside the raised patio. The amendments were subsequently submitted on September 27th 2022.",
    "This permission does not convey any consent which may be required under any legislation other than the Town and Country Planning Acts nor override any covenant or rights on the land."
