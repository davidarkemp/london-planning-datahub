    "The proposed development would involve the subdivision of an existing plot that with an existing dwellinghouse that has an original floorspace of less than 120sqm, something which would be unacceptable in principle because it would result in the loss of a family sized dwelling without justification for this loss and fail to re-provide a family sized home of where there is a recognised shortage of family accommodation in the Borough. As such, the proposed development would result in the loss of a family sized home and would undermine the objective of ensuring mixed and balanced communities to meet current and future housing needs contrary to Local Plan Policies 5 and 9.",
    "The proposed development would, due to the inadequate floor-to-ceiling heights of all three proposed flats and lack of private amenity space for Flats 1B and 1C, give rise to substandard levels of residential accommodation that would be detrimental to the amenity of prospective occupiers, in direct contrast to the aims of London Plan Policy D6 and Polices 7, and 26 of the Local Plan 2021. There would also be conflict with 135(f) requires developments to create places that have a high standard of amenity for future users.",
    "The proposed development would, by reason of its excessive bulk, scale, massing and top heavy appearance, result in the semi-detached pair of properties appearing as a prominant, unacceptably dominant and visually intrusive feature in the street scene that would detract from its original character and therefore be harmful to the appearance of the surrounding area, contrary to Policy 26 of the Havering Local Plan and the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document. There would also be conflict with paragraph 135(d) of the NPPF, which requires developments to maintain a strong sense of place.",
    "The proposed development would fail to provide any car parking spaces for the proposed flats, contrary to the provisions of Local Plan Policy 24.",
    "Insufficient information has been submitted as part of the application for the ecological impacts of the proposed development to be assessed, contrary to Policies 10 and 27 of the Havering Local Plan and Policy G7 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to the agent via email on 22/01/2025."
