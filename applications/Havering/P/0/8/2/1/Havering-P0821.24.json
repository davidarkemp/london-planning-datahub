    "The proposed gabled end would represent a significant increase in mass at roof level, which would not reflect the character of the terraced row, or the scheme as it was approved. The resultant dwelling would upset the rhythm of the terraced row and would present as visually dominant, detrimental to local character and the street-scene. In combination with the bulk of the rear dormer, the proposal would also result in excessive bulk and mass at roof level, detrimental to prevailing local character and the rear garden environment. As such the development would be detrimental to the character and appearance of the host property and local character and would therefore be contrary to Havering Local Plan Policies 7 and 26 and the design guidance within the Council's Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD.",
    "The proposals would not comply fully with the minimum prescribed standards required by Policy 7 of the HLP, or London Plan Policy D6 and it has not been demonstrated that a suitably high standard of amenity would be achieved through limited gross internal floor area and failure to meet with minimum bedroom size requirements. Further to this the limited headroom throughout would be exacerbated further by the accommodation within the roof. There would also be conflict with the NPPF, specifically Para 135 which requires development create places with a high standard of amenity for existing and future users.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to the agent in writing 15-10-2024",
    "The proposal, if granted planning permission on appeal, would be liable for the Mayor of London and Havering Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). Based upon the information supplied with the application, the Mayoral CIL payable would be £2,185 based on the calculation of £25.00 per square metre (87.4m²) and the Havering Community Infrastructure Levy (HCIL) would be a charge of £10,925 based on calculation of £125 per square metre. Each would be subject to indexation.",
    "Further details with regard to CIL are available from the Council's website."
