    "The development to which this permission relates must be commenced not later than three years from the date of this permission.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To comply with the requirements of Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended by Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004).",
    "The development hereby permitted shall not be carried out otherwise than in complete accordance with the approved plans (as set out on page one of this decision notice).",
    "Reason:-",
    "For the avoidance of doubt and to ensure that the development is carried out as approved.",
    "Following completion of the works on site, the developer shall submit for the written approval of the Local Planning Authority a \"Verification Report\" with confirmatory soil sampling and details of materials reused at the site that demonstrates that the reuse material was suitable does not pose any unacceptable risks to receptors associated with the site.",
    "Reason: \tTo protect those engaged in construction and occupation of the development from potential contamination and in order that the development accords with Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policy DC53.",
    "a)\tIf, during development, contamination not previously identified is found to be present at the site then no further development (unless otherwise agreed in writing with the local planning authority) shall be carried out until a remediation strategy detailing how this unsuspected contamination shall be dealt with has been submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority. The remediation strategy shall be implemented as approved.",
    "b)\tFollowing completion of the remediation works as mentioned in (a) above, a 'Verification Report' must be submitted demonstrating that the works have been carried out satisfactorily and remediation targets have been achieved.",
    "Reason: \tTo ensure that any previously unidentified contamination found at the site is investigated and satisfactorily addressed in order to protect those engaged in construction and occupation of the development from potential contamination.",
    "Contamination advice:",
    "This development site appears to have been the subject of past industrial activity which poses a high risk of pollution to controlled waters.",
    "The Environment Agency recommends that the developers should:",
    "1. Follow the risk management framework provided in CLR11, Model Procedures for the Management of Land Contamination, when dealing with land affected by contamination.",
    "2. Refer to our Guiding principles for land contamination for the type of information that we require in order to assess risks to controlled waters from the site. The local authority can advise on risk to other receptors, such as human health.",
    "3. Consider using the National Quality Mark Scheme for Land Contamination Management which involves the use of competent persons to ensure that land contamination risks are appropriately managed.",
    "4. Refer to the contaminated land pages on GOV.UK for more information.",
    "Waste materials advice:",
    "The CL:AIRE Definition of Waste: Development Industry Code of Practice (version 2) provides operators with a framework for determining whether or not excavated material arising from site during remediation and/ or land development works are waste or have ceased to be waste. Under the Code of Practice:",
    "-excavated materials that are recovered via a treatment operation can be re-used on-site providing they are treated to a standard such that they fit for purpose and unlikely to cause pollution",
    "-treated materials can be transferred between sites as part of a hub and cluster project",
    "-some naturally occurring clean material can be transferred directly between sites",
    "Developers should ensure that all contaminated materials are adequately characterised both chemically and physically, and that the permitting status of any proposed on-site operations are clear. If in doubt, the Environment Agency should be contacted for advice at an early stage to avoid any delays.",
