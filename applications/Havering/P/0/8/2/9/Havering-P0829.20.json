  "description": "Two Storey, 2-bed, detached dwelling with associated parking and amenity space on land R/O 19 Dunton Road",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed dwelling would appear as an incongruous and visually intrusive feature in the street scene due to its bulk, mass, scale and design features within close proximity of the street, failing to respect its context and entirely out of character with the established pattern of development on the street, including the removal of a mature tree, therefore harmful to local character, contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD.",
    "The proposed development would result in living conditions that do not create a suitably high quality living environment for future occupiers. The constraints of the site in conjunction with the design approach adopted would be to the detriment of the amenity of future occupiers. The constrained plot coupled with the shape and size of the amenity space result in a cramped and substandard outdoor space that is insufficient in area for the intended occupancy of the dwelling, giving rise to an overwhelming sense of enclosure in direct contrast to the aims of the Residential Design SPD and Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD.",
    "The proposed development would, by reason of its design, orientation, position and proximity to neighbouring properties cause overlooking and loss of privacy which would have a serious and adverse effect on the living conditions of adjacent occupiers to the rear, contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to the agent in writing on 13/8/20.",
    "The proposal, if granted planning permission on appeal, would be liable for the Mayor of London and Havering Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). Based upon the information supplied with the application, the CIL payable would be £1,735 and £8,675. Further details with regard to CIL are available from the Council's website."
