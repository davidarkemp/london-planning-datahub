    "Having regard to all of the Councils identified priorities, the proposals would prejudice the future development of adjoining land and conflict with the land-use priorities in Havering and fail to optimise and make effective and efficient use of the land to deliver new homes of which there is an identified housing need in the Borough. As such the proposals are contrary to Local Plan (2021) policies 3, 4 and 10 and London Plan (2021) policies D3, H1, H2 and H4 and paragraph 74 of the NPPF (2021).",
    "In the absence of compelling evidence to the contrary, the proposed Gypsy and Traveller Accommodation, by virtue of its proximity to residential dwellings, would have an unacceptable impact on the residential amenity due to increased levels of noise, disturbance and transport impacts associated with the proposed use of the site located in a wholly residential area and would have a harmful impact on the character and appearance of the surrounding area as there would fail to be sufficient control and enforceability to limit the number of pitches and caravans within the site to that which is proposed contrary to policies 11, 23, 26 and 34 of the Having Local Plan and London Plan policies T4 and D14.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to the Agent by email on the 18/07/22.",
    "The proposal, if granted planning permission on appeal, would be liable for LB Havering CIL and will incur a charge of £5,000 (subject to indexation) based on the calculation of £125.00 per square metre. The proposal is also liable for Mayoral CIL and will incur a charge of £1,000 (subject to indexation) based on the calculation of £25.00 per square metre.",
