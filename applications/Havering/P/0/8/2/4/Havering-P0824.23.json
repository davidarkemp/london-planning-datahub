The revisions involved showing the proposed flank windows on the side elevation so they matched up with the proposed floor plan. Neighbours were not re-consulted as this change was sought for clarity. Also, these windows can be added under permitted development and do not require planning consent. The amendments were subsequently submitted on 25-07-23."
