    "Insufficient justification has been provided regarding the current condition of the dwelling's existing windows, whether repair/refurbishment would be possible together with secondary glazing as a possible alternative. It is considered that the removal of all historic frames and glass panes would cause harm to the historic, architectural interest and aesthetic value of the property, eroding its evidential value. Furthermore, the proposed replacement with modern double-glazed units will introduce a discernibly modern appearance with double reflection, which would materially and unacceptably detract from the character and appearance of the application premises, to the detriment of the street-scene and fail to preserve the site's contribution to the character and appearance of the Gidea Park Conservation Area. The proposal would neither preserve, nor enhance the special character of the Gidea Park Conservation Area and is therefore contrary to Policies 26 and 28 of the Havering Local Plan",
    "Insufficient justification has been provided regarding the justification for the pruning of the Horse Chestnut tree and the proposed visual appearance of the tree following its pruning. It is considered that the pruning of the tree would materially and unacceptably detract from the character and appearance of the application site to the detriment of the street-scene, contrary to Policy 27 of the Havering Local Plan (2016-2031).",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason for it was given to the applicant via email on 05/12/2023."
