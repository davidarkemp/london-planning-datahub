    "The proposed rear extension would, by reason of its scale, bulk and proximity to the neighbouring properties at no.123 to no.129 Lambs Lane South be an intrusive, overbearing and unneighbourly development that would have a significant adverse effect on the amenities of these adjacent occupiers due to overlooking contrary to Policy 7 of the Havering Local Plan and the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document.",
    "The proposed development by reason of its scale and bulk would unacceptably compromise the architectural view from the garden scene, given the relatively short gardens to the neighbours to the rear.  Furthermore, the proposed development would appear as overbearing structure that would therefore appear dominant and visually intrusive, harmful to the host dwelling, street and garden scene and the character of the area contrary to the Supplementary Design Guidance (Residential Extensions and Alterations), policies D1, D3 and D4 of The London Plan (2021) and Policy 26 of the Local Plan.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, it was necessary to issue a decision as close to the statutory timeframe as possible as opposed to seeking amendments which would have significantly delayed the application."
