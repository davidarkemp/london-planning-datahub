  "decision_target_date": "16/04/2019",
  "site_name": "203 Rainham Road",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "Unless within 3 months of the date of this decision a scheme addressing land contamination (condition 3) and a scheme addressing noise (condition 4) are submitted in writing to the Local Planning Authority for approval, and unless the subsequently approved land contamination scheme is implemented within 1 month of the local planning authority's approval, the occupation of the site shall cease until such time as a scheme is approved and implemented.",
    "If no scheme in accordance with condition 4 (Noise) below is submitted within 3 months of the date of this decision, the use and any occupation of the site shall cease until such time as a scheme approved by the local planning authority is implemented.",
    "The development hereby permitted shall not be carried out otherwise than in complete accordance with the approved plans, including the associated demolition of the partly constructed side extension (as set out on page one of this decision notice).",
    "Reason:-",
    "The Local Planning Authority consider it essential that the whole of the development is carried out and that no departure whatsoever is made from the details approved, since the development would not necessarily be acceptable if partly carried out or carried out differently in any degree from the details submitted.  Also, in order that the development accords with Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policy DC61.",
    "No works shall take place in relation to any of the development hereby approved until a site investigation is undertaken to assess the level and extent of any landfill gas present, together with an assessment of associated risks. The investigation shall be in accordance with a scheme submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority prior to any development commencing.",
    "If during development works any contamination should be encountered which was not previously identified in the Site Investigation then works should halt immediately and the Local Planning Authority consulted to agree appropriate further action.",
    "Reason:-",
    "The development is situated on or within 250 metres of a current or historic landfill site or gravel pit.  Insufficient information has been supplied with the application to judge the risk arising from landfill gas.  Submission of an assessment prior to commencement will protect those redeveloping this site and any future occupants from potential lan",
    "No works shall take place in relation to any of the development hereby approved until a scheme for protecting the adjacent dwelling(s) from noise from the proposed development is submitted to and approved by the Local Planning Authority. Any works which form part of the scheme shall be completed before any of the approved development is occupied.",
    "Reason:-",
    "Insufficient information has been supplied with the application to judge the appropriateness of the noise insulation measures to be employed. Submission of the information prior to commencement will prevent noise nuisance to the development from affecting the neighbouring dwellings.",
    "Within 3 months of the date of the decision, the unauthorised partially built side extension shall be demolished and all arising materials shall be removed from the site (or the arising materials re-used).",
    "REASON: To enable the Local Planning Authority to regulate and control the development of land, to preserve the residential and visual amenities of the locality, and to secure a satisfactory standard of development.",
    "All new external finishes shall be carried out in materials to match those of the existing building(s) to the satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To safeguard the appearance of the premises and the character of the immediate area, and in order that the development accords with the Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policy DC61.",
    "The roof area of the extension hereby permitted shall not be used as a balcony, roof garden or similar amenity area without the grant of further specific permission from the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:-",
    "In the interests of the amenity of the occupiers of neighbouring dwellings, and in order that the development accords with the  Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policy DC61.",
    "The premises shall not be used for the purposes hereby permitted other than between the hours of 07:00 and 19:00 on Mondays to Saturdays and not at all on Sundays, Bank or Public holidays without the prior consent in writing of the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To enable the Local Planning Authority to retain control in the interests of amenity, and in order that the development accords with Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policy DC61.",
    "The number of children accommodated within the premises hereby approved shall not exceed 30, and the number of children within the play area to the rear of the property hereby approved shall not exceed 15 at any one time without the prior consent in writing of the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To enable the Local Planning Authority to retain control and to avoid disturbance to",
    "adjoining residents, and that the development accords with Development Control",
    "Policies Development Plan Document Policy DC61",
    "Statement Required by Article 35(2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management) Order 2015: No significant problems were identified during the consideration of the application, and therefore it has been determined in accordance with paragraph 38 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2018."
