    "The development to which this permission relates must be commenced not later than three years from the date of this permission.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To comply with the requirements of Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended by Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004).",
    "The development hereby permitted shall not be carried out otherwise than in complete accordance with the approved plans (as set out on page one of this decision notice).",
    "Reason:-",
    "For the avoidance of doubt and to ensure that the development is carried out as approved.",
    "Notwithstanding the provisions of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015, no window or other opening (other than those shown on the submitted and approved plan,) shall be formed in the flank wall(s) of the building(s) hereby permitted, unless specific permission under the provisions of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 has first been sought and obtained in writing from the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:-",
    "In order to ensure a satisfactory development that will not result in any loss of privacy or damage to the environment of neighbouring properties which exist or may be proposed in the future.",
    "No works shall take place in relation to any of the development hereby approved until a full and detailed application for the Secured by Design award scheme is submitted to the Local Planning Authority, setting out how the principles and practices of the Secured by Design Scheme are to be incorporated. Once approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority in consultation with the Metropolitan Police Designing Out Crime Officers, the development shall be carried out in accordance with the agreed details.",
    "Reason:-",
    "Insufficient information has been supplied with the application to judge whether the proposals meet Secured by Design standards.  Submission of a full and detailed application prior to commencement is in the interest of creating safer, sustainable communities and to reflect policy in the NPPF.",
    "The supported living scheme hereby approved shall not at any one time have more than three residents and two support workers within the premises as described in the Design and Access Statement unless otherwise agreed to in writing by the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:-",
    "In the interests controlling the level of activity within the premises to protect the amenity of the occupiers of neighbouring dwellings.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: In accordance with paragraph 38 of the National Planning Policy Framework, improvements required to make the proposal acceptable were negotiated with the agent via email. The revisions involved providing a site plan demonstrating cycle and refuse storage. The amendments were subsequently submitted on 26/03/2024."
