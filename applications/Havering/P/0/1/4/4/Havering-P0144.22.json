(Revised restoration plan for the Rainham Marshes Silt Lagoons following the completion of the formation of the silt lagoons from that originally prepared for extant permission L/HAV/2819/79, involving the reconfiguration of topographic levels.",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The current application which seeks to vary condition 2 under Section 73 (s73) would include the introduction of processing of waste to the site. It is argued in law (Finney v Welsh Ministers) that Local Planning Authority cannot use section 73 to change the description of the development permitted. The proposed change to the permitted development is considered to be a material one which requires a fresh application as it will alter the description of the development permitted under planning permission reference P2076.17. Therefore, the application cannot be determined as submitted.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35(2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management) Order 2015: No significant problems were identified during the consideration of the application, and therefore it has been determined in accordance with paragraph 38 of the National Planning Policy Framework."
