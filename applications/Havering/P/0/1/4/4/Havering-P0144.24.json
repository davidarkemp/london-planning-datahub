    "The site is within the Metropolitan Green Belt, and the proposed development would, by reason of its scale, bulk, height, design and appearance, would result in disproportionate additions over and above the size of the original building and therefore, would be inappropriate in principle within the Green Belt. No special circumstances have been submitted in this case and the proposal is therefore contrary to Policies G2 of the London Plan 2021 and the National Planning Policy Framework 2023.",
    "The proposals would, by reason of its site constraints, location, setting, the lack and inadequate provision of external amenity space, and proximity to vehicular access boundary would materially harm the living conditions of future occupiers, which would be contrary to Policy 7 of the Local Plan 2021.",
    "The proposed layout and design of the residential communal entrance door from Noak Hill Road would fail to provide a prominent, generous and secure access for residents and the lack of improvement to the existing harsh appearance of the forecourt, would create a cramped layout and fail to compliment or improve the visual amenity and character of the area contrary to policies 26 and 27 of  Local Plan, policies D3,D4, D5, D6, D8 and D11 of the London Plan (2021) and the NPPF 2023.",
    "The proposed development would due to its scale, massing, height and the general design, would be an unneighbourly, overbearing and an oppressive development which would result in a significant impact on the amenity of immediate adjacent occupiers contrary to Policy 7 of the Local Plan 2021 and the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document (2011).",
    ".",
    "In the absence of a full Tree Survey, the proposed development would result in the removal and/or harm to trees on/adjacent site, which would be materially harmful to the character and amenity of site and surrounding area, contrary to Policy 27 of the Local Plan and the Protection of Trees during Development Supplementary Planning Document and NPPF 2023.",
    "The proposal, if granted planning permission on appeal, would be liable for the Mayor of London and the Havering Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). Based upon the information supplied with the application, the CIL payable would be Â£32,550 subject to indexation. Further details with regard to CIL are available from the Council's website.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, it was necessary to issue a decision as close to the statutory timeframe as possible as opposed to seeking amendments which would have significantly delayed the application. Notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to the agent - Advance Architecture  via email on 9th April 2024, with further negotiations on 10th April 2024."
