    "In the view of the LPA, the proposed comprehensive use of the site will have a greater visual impact on the openness of the Green Belt that the previous temporary uses of the site. The proposed retention of the uses at the site would result in substantial harm to the openness and permanence of the Green Belt. The proposal is therefore considered contrary to Policy DC45 of the London Borough of Havering LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD 2008, Policy 7.16 of the London Plan 2016 and the National Planning Policy Framework 2019. Further, the proposal would not constitute very special circumstances which would may outweight all relevant planning harm.",
    "In the absence of noise evidence, the application would materially impact upon the reasonable residential amenities of existing residential occupiers. The proposal is considered contrary to the implementation of Policy DC55 of the London Borough of Havering LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD 2008 and relevant paragraphs contained in the National Planning Policy Framework 2019",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: In accordance with paragraph 38 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2019, the Local Planning Authority e-mailed the agent setting out concerns on the 18th March 2019, and met with the applicant and agent on the 01st April 2019 ; the applicant subsequently submitted supplementary information.
