  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed development would by reason of its fenestration arrangements, poor layout and excessive amount of hard standing, combined with the tapered boundaries of the site on this prominent corner location, would give rise to a cramped and contrived form of development that would materially detract from the open and spacious character of the street scene. Further, the proposal would result in poor levels of privacy and amenity for both future and existing occupiers locally, contrary to the implementation of Policy DC61 of the London Borough of Havering LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD 2008.",
    "In the absence of a legal agreement to secure contributions towards the demand for school places arising from the development, the proposal fails to satisfactorily mitigate the infrastructure impact of the development, contrary to the provisions of Policies DC29 and DC72 of the Development Control Policies DPD and Policy 8.2 of the London Plan.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to Dovetail Architects Ltd via email on 10th May 2019.",
    "The proposal, if granted planning permission on appeal, would be liable for the Mayor of London Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). Based upon the information supplied with the application, the CIL payable would be Â£2,400. Further details with regard to CIL are available from the Council's website."
