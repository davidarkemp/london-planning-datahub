    "The dwelling would form an incongruous feature in the street-scene and would be conspicuous through its 3m high flat roofed design with a timber cladding finish which fails to take into account the character of the street scene and would appear visually prominent.  The proposals would therefore be contrary to Policies 10, 7 and 26 of the Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 and also the NPPF which requires fundamentally that development add to the overall quality of the area whilst also establishing or maintaining a strong sense of place.",
    "There would be a poor outlook from the basement bedrooms resulting in a poor quality living environment for future occupiers, resulting in substandard residential accommodation to the detriment of the amenity of future occupants of this proposed dwelling.  The proposals would therefore be contrary to Policies 10, 7 and 26 of the Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 and Policy D6 of the London Plan.",
    "The proposed development would provide on-site parking in an area that should be 'car-free' and exceeds the maximum parking provision set out in Policy T6 of the London Plan.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, it was necessary to issue a decision as close to the statutory timeframe as possible as opposed to seeking amendments which would have significantly delayed the application.",
    "In the event that this application is allowed through the appeals process the proposals would be liable for the following CIL contributions:",
