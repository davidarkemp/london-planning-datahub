    "The proposal would be likely to lead to a materially harmful increase in noise and disturbance to nearby residents arising from the coming and goings of customers including those loitering in the vicinity of the premises.  This harm to residential amenity would conflict with the objectives of Policy ENV1 of the Havering Unitary development Plan.",
