    "The proposal is an incongruous form of development within the rear garden environment, out of character with the surrounding environment and established pattern of development due to its excessive height and building footprint and siting within close proximity of boundaries, therefore harmful to local character and detrimental to neighbouring residential amenity, contrary to Policy DC61 of the London Borough of Havering LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD 2008.",
