    "The proposed development would, by reason of the inadequate provision of quality amenity space, result in a cramped over-development of the site to the detriment of future occupiers and the character of the surrounding area contrary to Policies 7, 10 and 26 of the Local Plan and D6 of London Plan.",
    "The proposed development would, by reason of its poor design, bulk and mass and being built in close proximity to the site boundary, appear a cramped form of development and visually intrusive feature in the streetscene harmful to the appearance of the surrounding area and the visual amenity of the locality contrary to Policy 7, 10 and 26 of the Local Plan.",

This charge has been levied under s.206 of the Planning Act 2008 and includes both the Mayor of London's CIL and Havering Council's CIL.",
