    "The proposal would, by reason of its cramped internal layout, result in unsatisfactory internal spaces leading to a substandard living accommodation for future occupiers, contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD. The proposal would also fail to accord with the core principle set out in Paragraph 127 of the National Planning Policy Framework which seeks to ensure a high standard of amenity for existing and future occupants of land and buildings",
