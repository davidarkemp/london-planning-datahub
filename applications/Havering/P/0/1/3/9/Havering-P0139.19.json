    "The site is within the area identified in the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document as Metropolitan Green Belt.  The LDF and Government Guidance as set out in the NPPF is that in order to achieve the purposes of the Metropolitan Green Belt it is essential to retain and protect the existing rural character of the area so allocated and that the new development will only be permitted outside the existing built up areas in very exceptional circumstances. The proposed development does not meet any of the exemption criteria of paragraph 145 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2019, and no special circumstances have been identified in this case. Furthermore, the proposals would therefore result in inappropriate development, and the proposal is therefore contrary to Policy DC45 of the Havering Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD 2008 and the provisions of the National Planning Policy Framework 2019.",
    "The application would - through the design, scale, bulk and massing - result in development that have an unacceptable impact on the openness of the Metropolitan Green Belt, would have an unacceptable impact on the site, the streetscene, the area more generally and by extension the visual amenity of the area. The proposed development would therefore be unacceptable when assessed against policies 7.4, 7.5 and 7.6 of the London Plan (MALP) 2016, and policies CP17, DC45, and DC61 of the Havering Core Strategy Development Control Plan Development Control Policies DPD 2008, and the National Planning Policy Framework 2019.",
    "The proposed development would fail to adequately address concerns over flood risk and provide the degree of certainty that sufficient measures to address the risk of flooding have been adequately addressed in the design of the application. The proposed development is therefore unacceptable when assessed against policy 7.13 of the London Plan (MALP) 2016, and policies CP15 and DC48 of the Havering Core Strategy Development Control Plan Development Control Policies DPD 2008.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to the agent prior to the decision being issued.",
    "The Local Planning Authority have accepted the application at face value, insofar as non-planning related issues are concerned - specifically land ownership. The statements made by the applicant for this application as well as applicants for other applications relating to this piece of land are not endorsed by the Local Planning Authority. However, all neighbouring occupants have been notified of the proposals, and all interested parties have been afforded the opportunity to comment on this application."
