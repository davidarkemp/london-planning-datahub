  "description": "Retention of existing outbuilding",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposal building would by reason of its bulk, scale, layout and potential for independent use form an incongruous feature at the rear of the garden.  It would be contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD and the advice given in the NPPF which states that new development should conserve and enhance local character and respect the surrounding built environment, respond to local character and add to the overall qualities of an area and the guidance contained within the Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD.",
    "The layout of the outbuilding, intended use and verandah areas to the front and side through its intensification of use would introduce unreasonable levels of activity, noise and disturbance into the rear garden environment.  The development is therefore regarded as unneighbourly and to the detriment of the amenity of occupiers and is contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document, the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, it was necessary to issue a decision as close to the statutory timeframe as possible as opposed to seeking amendments which would have significantly delayed the application."
