  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed development would result in living conditions that do not create a suitably high quality living environment for future occupiers. The constraints of the site present in the absence of dedicated amenity space for future occupiers of the first floor accommodation in this suburban location and the internal arrangement would in places fail to align with minimum standards which would contribute to an environment which would be detrimental to the amenity of future occupants in direct contrast to the aims of London Plan Policy 3.5 and Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD.",
    "The proposed car parking layout is deigned in such a manor which would not allow the cars to manoeuvre within the site in order to enter and egress the site in a forward gear fashion. The proposed development would, by reason of the inadequate sightline and insufficient on site car parking provision, result in unacceptable overspill onto the adjoining roads to the detriment of highway safety and the free flow of traffic contrary to Policy DC33 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD.",
