    "The proposal is unacceptable in principle, as it would result in the loss of an existing playing field. The proposal is not considered to meet any of the exceptions of Sport England's Playing Fields Policy or to accord with paragraph 103 of the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF). As such, the proposal is contrary to Sport England's Playing Fields Policy and Guidance Document, Policy 18 of the Havering Local Plan, Policy S5 of the London Plan and the National Planning Policy Framework.",
    "The proposal would, by reason of its siting close to the boundaries of the site, proposed hours and days of use and the nature of its intended use, including proposed wider community use, give rise to a significant and noticeable intensification in the use of the site, particularly outside of current school operating hours, resulting in material harm to the amenity of neighbouring properties. The application is limited in terms of detail and the applicant has failed to demonstrate that the proposal would not be harmful in terms of resultant noise, disturbance, pedestrian and vehicular movements, boundary treatments and floodlighting of the site and lighting overspill, nor has it demonstrated that such issues are able to be overcome through the detailed design of the proposals.  As such, it is contrary to Policies 7, 18 and 34 of the Havering Local Plan, Policies D14 and S5 of the London Plan and the National Planning Policy Framework.",
    "The proposal provides insufficient detail regarding parking arrangements and likely levels of use and demand for vehicle parking.  Given the location and low accessibility of the site and the anticipated evening and weekend hours of  use, in the absence of information to the contrary, the proposal is considered likely to result in increased parking stress and congestion in surrounding streets, to the detriment of the functioning of the highway and neighbouring residential amenity.  The proposals have not demonstrated that the surrounding area is capable of accommodating increased demand for on-street parking without detriment to the amenity of surrounding occupants. Thus, the proposal is considered unacceptable, and would not be in accordance with Policy 24 of the Havering Local Plan, Policies T4 and T6 of the London Plan, and the National Planning Policy Framework.",
    "In the absence of a preliminary ecological appraisal and biodiversity information, the applicant has not demonstrated if the proposal will impact on protected or priority species as a result of loss of grassland and the introduction of flood lighting and would potentially result in significant adverse impacts on biodiversity which has not been effectively mitigated against contrary to Policies 27 and 30 of the Havering Local Plan and Policy G6 of the London Plan.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to the applicant via email on 28th November 2024."
