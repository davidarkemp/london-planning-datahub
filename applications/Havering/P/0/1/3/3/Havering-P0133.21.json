  "decision_conditions": [
    "The remedial works to the boundary treatment would not address the earlier reasons for refusal. The development would be materially larger than that which it replaced, thereby comprising of inappropriate development within the Green Belt. Furthermore, the combined height and proportion of wall to railing, gates and appearance of the front boundary treatment including detailing would present as a dominant and visually intrusive feature detrimental to local character and the openness of the Green Belt. The development is thereby contrary to policies DC45 and DC61 of the Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document as well as the provisions of the National Planning Policy Framework and Policy G2 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to the agent in writing 26-03-2021."
