    "REASON: The application has been assessed in context of these suggested uses and in view that this is a strategic industrial designation it is considered appropriate to restrict the permitted uses as such. This restriction is furthermore to comply with policy DC9 of the Adopted Development Plan Document (2008).",
    "CONDITION: The commercial premises shall not be used for the purposes hereby permitted other than between the hours of 07:00 and 20:00 on Monday to Friday, 08:00 to 18:00 on Saturday and 10:00 to 16:00 on Sundays and Bank Holidays.",

The Demolition and Construction Logistics Plan shall aim to identify the cumulative impacts of construction traffic for the area in terms of likely additional trips and mitigation required as well as the impact on other schemes under construction. The plan should show that construction vehicle movements would be optimised to avoid the am and pm traffic peaks and reduce highway impact on the TLRN in the vicinity of the site. Thereafter the approved details shall be implemented in full as agreed.",
