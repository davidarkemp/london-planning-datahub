    "The proposals do not comply with the objectives of Policy 9 of the Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 specfically subsections (i), (ii) and (iii) through having insufficent internal floor area and the absence of a family sized unit as the policy requires. In failing to align with the objectives of this policy there would also be conflict with Policies 3 and 5 of the Local Plan through loss of the existing family dwelling house. Furthermore there would be conflict with Paragraph 135 of the NPPF which amongst other considerations requires development add to the overall quality of an area and be sympathetic to local character, the provision of accommodation as that proposed would be removed from existing patterns of development.",
    "The proposed self-contained flats would by way of their insufficient internal space fail to meet with prescribed standards, lack of private amenity areas and poor means of access to communal space would represent substandard accommodation to the detriment of the amenity of the future occupiers. The proposals are therefore in conflict with the objectives of London Plan Policy D6, Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 Policy 7 and the Framework, specifically Para 135 which requires that development provide a high standard of amenity for future users.",
    "The cumulative impact of the hip to gable roof alteration and rear dormer window would be out of scale, be disproportionately large, overly prominent and relate unacceptably to the existing dwelling with a top heavy appearance which and would unbalance the appearance of this pair of semi-detached pair and appear as an unacceptably dominant and visually intrusive feature in the street scene and rear garden harmful to the appearance of the surrounding area, contrary to Policies 7 and 26 of the Havering Local Plan, D4 of the London Plan, NPPF and the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document.",
    "Preparation for any further re-submission informative.",
    "1) The applicant is advised to provide an existing and proposed block plan showing the parking for each flat and each space should measure 4.8m long by 2.4m wide. In addition, this plan should show the extension of the existing crossover to ensure that on-site parking can be easily provided and in line with the comments from the Highways Department outlined within the report. The applicant should engage with highways and the transport officers in respect to extending the crossover. The proposed vehicle crossover/dropped kerb will require the Area Operations Officer (AOO) for the area to be satisfied that it is compliant with the terms and conditions of the vehicle crossover application process.",
    "2)  It is noted that there are anomalies on the plans in respect to the parapet detail being omitted from the proposed side elevation for the proposed single storey side/rear extension and the depth of this extension shown on the floor pla",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to Mr Black (Agent) by e-mail on 4th April 2024.",
    "The proposal, if granted planning permission on appeal, would be liable for the Mayor of London and Havering Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). Based upon the information supplied with the application, the Mayoral CIL payable would be £600 based on the calculation of £25.00 per square metre and the Havering Community Infrastructure Levy (HCIL) would be a charge of £3,000 based on calculation of £125 per square metre. Each would be subject to indexation.",
    "Further details with regard to CIL are available from the Council's website."
