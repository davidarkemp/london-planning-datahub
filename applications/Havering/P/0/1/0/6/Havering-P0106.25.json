    "The original property prior to being extended had a gross internal floor area of less than 120sqm. Policy 8 of the Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 requires consideration of the original property. 37 Park Lane therefore fails to meet the requirements of Policy 8(i) and would not be regarded as appropriate for conversion. Its conversion to a HMO would have a negative impact on the supply of family housing in the borough as noted by the Outer North East London SHMA which identified a need for three bedroom properties.",
    "In the absence of any evidence otherwise by reason of its housing typology (and self contained nature of the annexe), the siting of the property and the nature of the use as a HMO with high prospective occupancy this would result in significantly higher levels of comings / goings and intensive activity which would generate more activity than a single household thereby resulting in a detrimental impact to the amenity of adjoining residents from noise and disturbance and movement associated. The development would therefore be contrary to Policies 8 and 34 of the Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 as well as the objectives of the NPPF, in particular Para 135 which amongst other considerations requires development not undermine quality of life or community cohesion and resilience.",
