    "The proposed development would by reason of its height, design, form and massing and the relationship with no.5 Retford Path would result in a discordant building form and cramped form of development, would be unacceptable and uncharacteristic for the surrounding area, and would adversely impact the character and appearance of the locality and the established pattern of development, contrary to the high-quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policies D3 and D4 of The London Plan (2021) and Policies 7 and 26 of the Local Plan.",
    "The proposed development by reason of its bulk and mass and close relationship to the shared boundary with no.5 Retford Path would result in an overbearing impact with overlooking to the detriment of their amenity and the enjoyment of the rear garden environment and rear windows contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policies D3 and D4 of The London Plan (2021) and Policies 7, 10 and 26 of the Local Plan.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, it was necessary to issue a decision as close to the statutory timeframe as possible as opposed to seeking amendments which would have significantly delayed the application.",
    "The proposal, if granted planning permission on appeal, would be liable for the Mayor of London and Havering Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). Based upon the information supplied with the application, the Mayoral CIL payable would be £2375 based on the calculation of £25.00 per square metre and the Havering Community Infrastructure Levy (HCIL) would be a charge of £11,875 based on calculation of £125 per square metre. Each would be subject to indexation.",
