  "decision_conditions": [
    "The bulk and scale of the proposed development would appear as an unneighbourly overdevelopment of the site, incongruous with the form of development within the rear garden environment, entirely out of character with the surrounding built form and within close proximity of the side boundaries therefore harmful to local character and detrimental to neighbouring residential amenity, contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD.",
    "The proposed development would result in poor living conditions that do not create a suitably high quality living environment for future occupiers. The constraints of the site in conjunction with the design approach adopted would be to the detriment of the amenity of future occupiers. The units fail to provide adequate outlook and aspect due to their siting close to the boundaries and orientation, and fail to provide outdoor amenity spaces. In addition, the orientation and positioning of the proposed openings fail to provide sufficient access to sunlight and compromise internal privacy due to their interaction with shared spaces. On this basis the cumulative impact of the design will result in substandard living conditions for future occupants, in direct contrast to the aims of London Plan Policy 3.5 and Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to agent via email.",
    "The proposal, if granted planning permission on appeal, would be liable for the Mayor of London Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). Based upon the information supplied with the application, the CIL payable would be Â£14,244. Further details with regard to CIL are available from the Council's website."
