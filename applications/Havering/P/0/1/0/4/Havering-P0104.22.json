  "description": "Addition of a pitched roof and dormer windows to the existing approved application P1035.20 flat roof Units 2 and 3 - to provide an uplift from 2 x single storey studios to 2 x two bed, 2 storey dwellings.",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The addition of pitched roofs and rear dormers to units 2 and 3 would materially change the contribution of the development to the street-scene. The extant scheme under reference P1035.20 formed an appropriate response to the constraints of the site and through the low level of units 2 and 3 as approved limited their presence in the street-scene and rear garden environment. The resultant dwellings proposed would through their increased scale, bulk and mass appear as incongruous and unacceptably dominant, overbearing and visually intrusive features in the rear gardens of adjacent premises which would be harmful to the appearance and character of the surrounding area when viewed alongside the other elements proposed including alterations to the host dwelling. There would through the alterations proposed be a sense of overdevelopment and the proposals would also be detrimental to neighbouring residential amenity through increased overlooking, loss of privacy, sense of overbearing as well",
