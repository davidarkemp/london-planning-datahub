    "The resultant layout of the building, and overall plot layout would be at odds with surrounding local character to the detriment of local character and appearance of the area, contrary to Policies DC61 and DC69 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD, the Hall Lane Policy Area Document.,  London Plan Policies 7.4 and 7.6 and paragraph 127 of the NPPF which requires development to add the overall quality of the area to be sympathetic to local character and history, including the surrounding built environment and landscape setting.",
    "The proposed development would result in living conditions that do not create a suitably high quality living environment for future occupiers, in particular accommodation within the roof which would fail to align with minimum prescribed standards. The constraints of the site in conjunction with the number of units proposed, internal arrangement and provision of amenity space would contribute to an environment which would be detrimental to the amenity of future occupants in direct contrast to the aims of London Plan Policy 3.5 and Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD.",
    "The development would create an uplift in occupancy which would be out of keeping with the surrounding suburban context. This would present in increased comings and goings to the site which would be over and above what could be regarded as acceptable and would be detrimental to local character and the amenity of adjoining and nearby occupiers. The development would then be both detrimental to local character and the amenity of nearby occupiers contrary to Policies DC61 and DC69 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD and the Hall Lane Policy Area Supplementary Planning Document.",
    "The proposed car parking layout is designed in such a manor which would not allow the cars to manoeuvre within the site in order to enter and egress the site in a forward gear fashion. The proposed development would, by reason of the inadequate sightline potentially result in unacceptable overspill onto the adjoining roads to the detriment of highway safety, the amenity of surrounding occupants through increased competition for spaces and the free flow of traffic contrary to Policies DC33 and DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Amendments were sought by staff which addressed issues with parking, however it was not considered that the above reasons for refusal were capable of being overcome. Consideration was given to seeking fruther amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to the agent in writing 26-04-2020"
