  "description": "Proposed crossover to create entrance from Ferry Lane with sliding gate to match existing gate.",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The development to which this permission relates must be commenced not later than three years from the date of this permission.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To comply with the requirements of Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended by Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004).",
    "The development hereby permitted shall not be carried out otherwise than in complete accordance with the approved plans (as set out on page one of this decision notice).",
    "Reason:-",
    "The Local Planning Authority consider it essential that the whole of the development is carried out and that no departure whatsoever is made from the details approved, since the development would not necessarily be acceptable if partly carried out or carried out differently in any degree from the details submitted.  Also, in order that the development accords with Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policy DC61.",
    "All new external finishes shall be carried out in materials to match those of the existing boundary treatment to the satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To safeguard the appearance of the premises and the character of the immediate area, and in order that the development accords with the Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policy DC61.",
    "No works to the highway shall take place until a legal agreement under section 278 of the Highways Act 1980 has been drawn up and agreed with the Local Highway Authority for the works relating to any permanent alterations or improvements to the public highway. The legal agreement shall be submitted to and agreed in writing with the Local Authority before the commencement of any works relating to the highway.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To ensure that the works are carried out to the required standards and specifications of the Local Highway Authority.",
    "No works to the highway shall take place until an amendment to the Traffic Management Order (TMO) for Ferry Lane is requested from the Local Highway Authority. Traffic Management Orders (TMOs) are legal documents drafted and made by the Council that regulate the use of highways for movement and parking and also off street parking areas within the borough by drivers of vehicles and/or pedestrians, usually under the Road Traffic Regulation Act (RTRA) 1984 (as amended). The application to amend the TMO/s shall be submitted to and agreed in writing with the Local Authority before the commencement of any works relating to the highway.",
    "Reason:-",
    "Any amendments to controls on the highway require amendments to TMOs following the statutory process as defined by the Local Authorities' Traffic Orders (Procedure) (England and Wales) Regulations 1996.",
    "The proposal involves works which affect the highway and/or its verge.  Before commencing such works you must obtain separate consent of the Highway Authority.  Please note that the dropped kerb requires that the Highways Authority design, construct and implement the works. Please contact the Streetcare on 01708 432563.",
    "Changes to the public highway (including permanent or temporary access)",
    "- Planning approval does not constitute approval for changes to the public highway. Highway Authority approval will only be given after suitable details have been submitted considered and agreed. If new or amended access is required (whether temporary or permanent), there may be a requirement for the diversion or protection of third party utility plant or highway authority assets and it is recommended that early involvement with the relevant statutory undertaker takes place. The applicant must contact Engineering Services on 01708 433751 to discuss the scheme and commence the relevant highway approvals process. Please note that unauthorised work on the highway is an offence.",
    "Highway legislation",
    "- The developer (including their representatives and contractors) is advised that planning consent does not discharge the requirements of the New Roads and Street Works Act 1991 and the Traffic Management Act 2004. Formal",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: No significant problems were identified during the consideration of the application, and therefore it has been determined in accordance with paragraphs 186-187 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2012."
