    "The single storey rear extension would, by reason of its depth and height, be an intrusive and un-neighbourly development, which would  give rise to an undue sense of enclosure and loss of outlook in the rear garden environment contrary to the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document and Policy 7 of the Local Plan.",
    "The proposed patio area would, by reason of its height, position and proximity to neighbouring property cause overlooking and loss of privacy which would have a serious and adverse effect on the living conditions of adjacent occupiers, contrary to the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document and Policy 7 of the Local Plan.",
