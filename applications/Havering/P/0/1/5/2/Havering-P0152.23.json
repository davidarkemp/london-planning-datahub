    "The siting of the communications hub and associated signage at the edge of the footway would introduce an intrusive feature which would detract from the character and appearance of the area and contribute to visual clutter. It is therefore considered not to comply with Policies 25 and 26 of the Havering Local Plan 2016-2031, London Plan Policies D4, D8 and SI6 and the objectives of the NPPF.",
    "In the absence of evidence otherwise, officers consider that the proposals would lead to increased risk to pedestrian and highway safety through the siting and design of the communications hub close to the back-edge of the highway, heavy pedestrian footfall and within proximity to a busy junction where it would potentially pose a distraction to drivers who should be alert. The proposals are therefore contrary to Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 Policy 23, London Plan Policies Policy T2 and D8 which each fundamentally require the public realm to be safe.",
