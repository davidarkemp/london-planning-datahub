    "The use of the site as sought would not comply with the objectives of Havering Local Plan Policy 11 and the Havering Gypsy and Traveller Accommodation Assessment (GTAA). No compelling evidence has been presented which shows an identified need over that set out in the Local Plan.",
    "The site is within the Metropolitan Green Belt and the proposed development would not align with any of the relevant exceptions set out in Section 13 of the NPPF and would therefore comprise of inappropriate development. The proposals would make provision for development not allowed for in any of the given exceptions and would represent an unwelcome urbanisation of the site detrimental to the openness of the Green Belt and the purposes of including land within the Green Belt. In the absence of any compelling Very Special Circumstances which would outweigh the harm of inappropriateness and harm to openness the proposed development is unacceptable in principle and in contrast to the objectives of the NPPF and Policy G2 of the London Plan 2021.",
