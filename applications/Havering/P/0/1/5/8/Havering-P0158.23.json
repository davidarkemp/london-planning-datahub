    "The proposed dwelling would, by reason of its detached built form and roof and fenestration design, appear as an incongruous form of development along Suttons Gardens, out of character with the surrounding environment and established pattern of dwellings. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policies 7, 10 and 26 of the Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 and also Paragraph 130(a) of the NPPF which requires fundamentally that development add to the overall quality of the area whilst also establishing or maintaining a strong sense of place.",
    "The proposed development would, by reason of its limited floor-to-ceiling heights, storage space, and lack of shower room or bathroom on the ground floor result in a low quality design that would be to the detriment of future occupants, contrary to the provisions of Policy D6 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy 7 of the Havering Local Plan 2016-2031.",
    "The proposed dwelling would, by reason of its proximity to the rear garden environments of nos. 134 and 136 Station Lane, cause overlooking and loss of privacy which would have a serious and adverse effect on the living conditions of these neighbouring occupiers, contrary to Policies 7 and 10 of the Havering Local Plan 2016-2031.",
    "The proposed development would result in an overprovision of car parking spaces, which would fail to align with Policy T6.1 of the London Plan 2021, which seeks to reduce private car use.",
