  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed front extension would by reason of its design, massing and detailing be harmful to the intrinsic character of the host premises and spatial qualities of the Conservation Area which is not characterised by such development. It would therefore neither preserve nor enhance the special character of this part of the Conservation Area. The development sought is therefore contrary to Policies DC61 and DC68 of the Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document, the Heritage SPD and the guidance contained within the NPPF.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to the agent in writing 30-03-2021."
