  "decision_conditions": [
    "The site is located within the area identified as Metropolitan Green Belt. The proposals by reasons of its scale, mass, height and unsympathetic roof design with dormer windows across its width on the front and rear roof slopes, would alter the inherent  rural character of the site. The proposals would introduce an extensive amount of hardstanding area to the front of site with rear and side gardens defined primarily by boundary treatments, which would be significantly harmful to the character and appearance of the Green Belt. 'Very special circumstances' have not been submitted in this case, the proposal is therefore considered to be inappropriate development which would be harmful to the character and openness of the Green Belt, contrary to Policy DC45 of the London Borough of Havering Local Development Framework Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document 2008,  Policy G2 of the London Plan as well as the provisions of the National Planning Policy Framew",
    "The proposal, if granted planning permission on appeal, would be liable for the Havering Council's and Mayor of London Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). Based upon the information supplied with the application, the CIL payable would be £44, 850. Further details with regard to CIL are available from the Council's website.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, it was necessary to issue a decision as close to the statutory timeframe as possible as opposed to seeking amendments which would have significantly delayed the application."
