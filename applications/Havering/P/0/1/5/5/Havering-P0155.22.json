    "The proposed boundary treatment would, by reason of its height and design, appear incongruous and form an unacceptably dominant and visually intrusive feature within the street, harmful to the appearance of the street scene and detracting from the character of the surrounding area. As such, the proposed boundary treatment is considered to be contrary to Policy 26 of the Havering Local Plan 2021 and the Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD.",
    "The proposed ground and first floor rear extensions would, by reason of its overall depth, bulk and gabled form, result in a dominant and visually intrusive feature detrimental to the character and appearance of the host property and visual amenity of the locality, as well as having an overbearing impact and an increased sense of enclosure to the detriment of the amenity of the adjoining occupiers at No.129 and No.133 Betterton Road contrary to Policy 26 of the Havering Local Plan 2021 and Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD 2011.",
