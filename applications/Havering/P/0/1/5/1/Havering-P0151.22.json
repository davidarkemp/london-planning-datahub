  "decision_conditions": [
    "The development to which this permission relates must be commenced not later than three years from the date of this permission.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To comply with the requirements of Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended by Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004).",
    "The development hereby permitted shall not be carried out otherwise than in complete accordance with the approved plans (as set out on page one of this decision notice).",
    "Reason:-",
    "For the avoidance of doubt and to ensure that the development is carried out as approved.",
    "The premises shall not be used for the purposes hereby permitted other than between the hours of 07:00 and 22:00 Monday through Sunday without the prior consent in writing of the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To enable the Local Planning Authority to retain control in the interests of amenity.",
    "Provision shall be made for the storage of food waste and general waste within the premises ahead of collection and at no time shall any waste in association with the business use hereby permitted be stored outside of the premises.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To protect the amenity of occupiers of nearby premises.",
    "No construction works or deliveries into the site shall take place other than between the hours of 08.00 to 18.00 on Monday to Friday and 08.00 to 13.00 hours on Saturdays unless agreed in writing with the local planning authority.  No construction works or deliveries shall take place on Sundays, Bank or Public Holidays unless otherwise agreed in writing by the local planning authority.",
    "Reason:  To protect residential amenity.",
    "The Specific Noise Level emitted from the hereby permitted plant or machinery shall not exceed 10dB below the prevailing background noise level (LA90, T).  Additionally, the Rating Sound Level shall not exceed the prevailing background noise level (LA90, T).  The measurement position, assessment and definitions shall be made according to BS4142:2014 + A1:2019 \"Methods for rating and assessing industrial and commercial sound.\" The use hereby permitted must cease during any period that this condition is not complied with.",
    "Reason:   To protect the amenity of noise sensitive premises from noise from mechanical plant.",
    "No deliveries shall be received at the premises outside of the following hours:",
    "08.00-18.00 Monday-Friday",
    "08.00-13.00 Saturday",
    "No deliveries on Sunday, Public and Bank Holidays",
    "Reason: To prevent a loss of amenity from deliveries at unreasonable times.",
    "No waste collections shall occur at the premises outside of the following hours:",
    "07.00-18.00 Monday-Friday",
    "08.00-13.00 Saturday",
    "No deliveries on Sunday, Public and Bank Holidays",
    "Reason:  To prevent a loss of amenity from waste collections at unreasonable times.",
    "No primary cooking, deep frying or grilling of food shall take place as part of the use hereby approved unless fume extract and odour minimisation equipment is installed, operated, maintained and serviced in accordance with details which have previously been submitted and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:-",
    "The current plans show only a domestic cooker hood and low level extract, which would be unsuitable to adequately disperse odour and fumes from primary cooking, frying or grilling.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: In accordance with paragraph 38 of the National Planning Policy Framework, improvements required to make the proposal acceptable were negotiated with the agent via email and phone. The revisions involved details of extractor and delivery. The amendments were subsequently submitted on 18/05/2022.",
    "INFORMATIVE",
