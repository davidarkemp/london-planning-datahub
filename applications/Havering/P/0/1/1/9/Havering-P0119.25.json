    "The site is within the Metropolitan Green Belt and the proposed development would not align fully with any of the exceptions set out in Section 13 of the NPPF and would therefore be inappropriate development. It would also result in a significant increase in the bulk, scale, massing and footprint compared to the existing outbuilding within the site, which would have a profound and material impact on the character and openness of the Green Belt. In the absence of any Very Special Circumstances which would outweigh the harm of inappropriateness and harm to openness, the proposed development is inappropriate development and unacceptable in principle contrary to the objectives of the NPPF and Policy G2 of the London Plan.",
    "The proposed development, by reason of its inadequate internal floor to ceiling heights, would give rise to a poor quality development and substandard living conditions to the detriment of the amenity of the future occupiers, contrary to the provisions of Policy D6 of the London Plan and Policy 7 of the Local Plan. There would also be conflict with paragraph 135(f) of the NPPF which requires developments to create places that have a high standard of amenity for future users.",
    "Insufficient information has been submitted as part of the application for the ecological impacts of the proposed dwellings to be adequately assessed, contrary to Policies 10 and 30 of the Havering Local Plan and Policy G7 of the London Plan.",
    "The proposal, if granted planning permission on appeal, would be liable for the Mayor of London and Havering Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). Based upon the information supplied with the application, the proposals would be liable for the following CIL contributions:",
    "Mayoral CIL (MCIL2) contribution of £5,750 (x £25 per sqm).",
    "Havering CIL (HCIL) contribution of £28,750 (x £125 per sqm).",
    "Each contribution would be subject to indexation.",
    "Further details with regard to CIL are available from the Council's website.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason for it was given to the agent in writing 20/06/2025."
