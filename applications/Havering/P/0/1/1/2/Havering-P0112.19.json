    "The proposal would, by reason of its bulk, scale, layout and independent use would be an incongruous feature at the rear of the garden with its sold built form sharply in contrast with other domestic outbuildings typically found in the surrounding residential gardens. As such it would appear as an uncharacteristic intrusion into open garden space, being a visually disruptive addition and against the pattern of the development in the local area. It would also result in an unsatisfactory relationship between building blocks leading to overlooking and loss of privacy to the detriment of amenity and contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD and the advice given in the NPPF which states that new development should conserve and enhance local character and respect the surrounding built environment, respond to local character and add to the overall qualities of an area.",
    "The proposed dwelling by reason of its inadequate floorspace would create unsatisfactory quality of accommodation detrimental to the amenity of the future occupiers of the site. In this respect the proposal would be contrary to policy 3.5 of the London Plan, quality and design of housing developments, Policy DC3 of the LDF Core Strategy and the advice given in adopted Havering Residential Design Guide.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to the planning agent on the 3rd January 2020."
