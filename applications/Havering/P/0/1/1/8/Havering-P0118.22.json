  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposals through increasing the size of the site and introducing an increased number of pitches in areas of the site which were previously undeveloped would not comply with the objectives of Havering Local Plan Policy 11 and the Havering Gypsy and Traveller Accommodation Assessment (GTAA). No compelling evidence has been presented which shows an identified need over that set out in the Local Plan.",
    "The site is within the Metropolitan Green Belt and the proposed development would not align with any of the relevant exceptions set out in Section 13 of the NPPF and would therefore comprise of inappropriate development. The proposals would make provision for development not allowed for in any of the given exceptions and would encroach into previously undeveloped space which is detrimental to openness and conflicts with the purposes of including land within the Green Belt. In the absence of any compelling Very Special Circumstances which would outweigh the harm of inappropriateness and harm to openness the proposed development is unacceptable in principle and in contrast to the objectives of the NPPF and Policy G2 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to the agent in writing 15 March 2024."
