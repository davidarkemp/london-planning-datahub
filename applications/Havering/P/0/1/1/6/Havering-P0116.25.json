    "The proposed development would, by reason of its height, degree of front projection and proximity to the unattached shared boundary, result in an extension that would be harmful to the amenity of no. 77 Tuck Road due to creating an overbearing form of development and giving rise to a sense of enclosure and loss of outlook to these neighbouring occupants, contrary to Policy 7 of the Local Plan and the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to the applicant via email on the 25th March 2025."
