    "Reason:-",

    "Reason:-",
    "In order to ensure a satisfactory development that will not result in any loss of privacy or damage to the environment of neighbouring properties which exist or may be proposed in the future, and in order that the development accords with Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policy DC61.",
    "The applicant should liaise with the Council's Streetcare Tree Team Department on 01708 432563 regarding removal of the tree in front of the property to allow for easy access to and from the site so the two parking spaces on the submitted plans can be provided.",

    "However, if the surface to be covered is more than five square metres planning permission will be needed for laying traditional, impermeable driveways that do not provide for the water to run to a permeable area.",
