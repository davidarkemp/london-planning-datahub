  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed two storey rear extension would, by reason of its height, form, elongation of the massing, lack of articulation and prominent siting, lack subservience and distort the original modest proportions of the exhibition period house, adversely affecting its architectural interest by altering its historic roofscape and by the loss of historic fabric, original features and details from the rear elevation and appear incongruous and visually intrusive, harmful to the character and appearance of this 1911 Exhibition property and the  streetscene and would fail to  preserve or enhance the Gidea Park Conservation Area contrary to Policies CP18, DC61 and DC68 of the Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document, the Heritage Supplementary Planning Document and Policy HC1 of the London Plan and the National Planning Policy Framework.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to Hurst Associates via email on 24th March 2021."
