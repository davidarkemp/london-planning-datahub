    "The development to which this permission relates must be commenced not later than three years from the date of this permission.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To comply with the requirements of Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended by Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004).",
    "The development hereby permitted shall not be carried out otherwise than in complete accordance with the approved plans (as set out on page one of this decision notice).",
    "Reason:-",
    "The Local Planning Authority consider it essential that the whole of the development is carried out and that no departure whatsoever is made from the details approved, since the development would not necessarily be acceptable if partly carried out or carried out differently in any degree from the details submitted.  Also, in order that the development accords with Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policy DC61.",
    "The use of the building shall be as a House in Multiple Occupation (HMO) only as defined in the Housing Act (2004), and by Use Class C4 of the Town and Country Planning (Use Classes) Order 1987 (as amended), and for no other use, and shall not be occupied by more than 12 persons at any time.",
    "Reason:-",
    "In order to ensure that the use of the building and level of occupancy does not give rise to an unacceptable level of impact on adjoining residential occupiers or have an adverse impact on the character and appearance of the area in accordance with policies DC4, DC5 and DC61 of the Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD.",
    "The area to the front of the site shown on drawing no.14198_01 Rev B shall be set aside for car parking and retained permanently thereafter for the accommodation of vehicles visiting the site and shall not be used for any other purpose.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To ensure that car parking accommodation is made permanently available to the standards adopted by the Local Planning Authority in the interest of highway safety, and that the development accords with the Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policy DC33.",
    "No building shall be occupied or use commenced until refuse and recycling facilities are provided in accordance with details which shall previously have been submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority. The refuse and recycling facilities shall be permanently retained thereafter.",
    "Reason:-",
    "Insufficient information has been supplied with the application to judge how refuse and recycling will be managed on site.  Submission of this detail prior to occupation in the case of new building works or prior to the use commencing in the case of changes of use will protect the amenity of occupiers of the development and also the locality generally and ensure that the development accords with the Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policy DC61.",
    "No building shall be occupied or use commenced until cycle storage is provided in accordance with details previously submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority. The cycle storage shall be permanently retained thereafter.",
    "Reason:-",
    "Insufficient information has been supplied with the application to demonstrate what facilities will be available for cycle parking.  Submission of this detail prior to occupation in the case of new building works or prior to the use commencing in the case of changes of use is in the interests of providing a wide range of facilities for non-motor car residents and sustainability.",
    "Before the development hereby permitted is occupied, arrangements shall be agreed in writing with the local planning authority and be put in place to ensure that, with the exception of disabled persons, no resident of the development shall obtain a resident's parking permit within any controlled parking zone which may be in force in the local area at the time.",
    "Reason:-",
    "In order to safeguard the amenities of surrounding residential properties and ensure minimal disruption of traffic in the locality.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35(2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management) Order 2015: No significant problems were identified during the consideration of the application, and therefore it has been determined in accordance with paragraph 38 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2019.",
    "Changes to the public highway (including permanent or temporary access)",
    "Planning approval does not constitute approval for changes to the public highway. Highway Authority approval will only be given after suitable details have been submitted considered and agreed.  If new or amended access as required (whether temporary or permanent), there may be a requirement for the diversion or protection of third party utility plant or highway authority assets and it is recommended that early involvement with the relevant statutory undertaker takes place. The applicant must contact Engineering Services on 01708 433751 to discuss the scheme and commence the relevant highway approvals process. Please note that unauthorised work on the highway is an offence.",
    "Highway legislation",
    "The developer (including their representatives and contractors) is advised that planning consent does not discharge the requirements of the New Roads and Street Works Act 1991 and the Traffic Management Act 2004.  Formal notifications and approval will be needed for any highway works (including temporary works of any nature) required during the construction of the development.",
    "Please note that unauthorised work on the highway is an offence.",
    "Temporary use of the public highway",
    "The developer is advised that if construction materials are proposed to be kept on the highway during construction works then they will need to apply for a license from the Council. If the developer requires scaffolding, hoarding or mobile cranes to be used on the highway, a licence is required and Street Management should be contacted make the necessary arrangements. Please note that unauthorised use of the highway for construction works is an offence.",
    "Surface water management",
    "The developer is advised that surface water from the development in both its temporary and permanent states should not be discharged onto the highway. Failure to prevent such is an offence."
