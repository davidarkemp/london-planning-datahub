    "The proposal, by reason of its width, would appear as an unacceptably dominant and visually intrusive feature in the rear garden scene, harmful to the character and appearance of the surrounding area contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document and the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document.",
    "The proposal, by reason of position close to the boundary, would be an intrusive and unneighbourly development and have an adverse effect on the amenity of the adjacent occupiers at No. 42 Hawthorn Avenue, Rainham, contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document, the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to Mr Waseem (agent) by e-mail on 30/03/21."
