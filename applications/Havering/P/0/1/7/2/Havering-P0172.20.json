    "The proposed window replacement, by reason of their materiality, would materially and unacceptably detract from the character and appearance of the host property, to the detriment of the street-scene. Insufficient information has been provided by way of plans or window details to demonstrate that the proposal is acceptable with within the conservation area. The proposal would neither preserve, nor enhance the special character of the Gidea Park Conservation Area and the proposal would not provide sufficient public benefits to outweigh this harm. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies DC61 and DC68 of the Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document.",
