    "The proposed development by reason of its excessive bulk, mass and height on a dwelling in a clear row of dormer bungalows would appear as a dominant and visually intrusive feature detrimental to the character and appearance of the host dwelling, the visual amenity of the surrounding area and would unbalance the pair of semi-detached dwellings contrary to Havering Local Plan Policy 7 and Policy 26 and the design guidance within the Council's Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: In accordance with paragraph 38 of the National Planning Policy Framework, improvements required to make the proposal acceptable were negotiated with the applicant via email on 28.3.24.  The revisions involved redesigning the scheme so that it appears as a dormer bungalow.  The applicant declined to make the suggested revisions."
