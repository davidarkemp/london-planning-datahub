  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed rear dormer window, by reason of its location on the ridge of the rear roof slope, would appear as incongruous and visually intrusive feature on this prominent corner plot that would be out of character with the design and appearance of the host property and therefore materially harm the visual amenity of the surrounding area, contrary to Policies 7 and 26 of the Havering Local Plan and the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Improvements to the proposals to revise the roof design of the proposed rear dormer and amend the location of the front roof lights within the roofslope were negotiated with the agent during the course of the application. However, the design of the rear dormer was considered at detailed assessment stage to still be unacceptable. Further significant alteration would have been required to bring the development within the realms of acceptability so it was decided to proceed to determine the application."
