Juliet balcony to first floor rear elevation, conversion of roof space to habitable use to include 2 rear dormers and installation of a raised patio area in rear garden",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed single storey rear extension with the inclusion of a raised patio and the provision of a balcony at first floor level would by virtue of the excessive height appear incongruous, dominant and visually intrusive in the rear garden environment contrary to policies D1 and D4 of The London Plan (2021), policy DC61 of the London Borough of Havering LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD 2008, and the London Borough of Havering Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD 2011.",
    "The proposed single storey rear extension with the inclusion of a raised patio and the provision of a balcony at first floor level would by virtue of the excessive height be unneighbourly which would give rise to an uncomfortable and overbearing effect resulting in an increased sense of overlooking, loss of privacy and be harmful to neighbouring properties contrary to Policy DC61 of the London Borough of Havering LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD 2008, and the London Borough of Havering Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD 2011.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to Mr John Pittaway via email on 19th March 2021."
