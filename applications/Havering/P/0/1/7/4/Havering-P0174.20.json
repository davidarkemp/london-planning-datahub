    "The proposed development, by reason of the scale, bulk, depth and mass of the rear projection, combined with the scale of the alterations to the roof form, would be an intrusive and overbearing form of development within the streetscene and rear garden environment, harmful to local character and amenity and contrary to the provisions of Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document, the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document and Policy 7.4 of the London Plan.",
    "The proposed development by reason of its excessive scale, height and detailed design lacks subservience to the existing dwelling; completely overwhelms the original character of the host property and would appear as an incongruous, dominant and visually intrusive and overbearing form of development feature in the front street scene harmful to the appearance and character of the host dwelling and streetscene contrary to policies 7.4 and 7.6 of The London Plan (2016), policy DC61 of the London Borough of Havering LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD 2008, and the London Borough of Havering Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD 2011",
    "The proposed extensions would, by reason of its excessive depth, height and bulk, be an intrusive and unneighbourly development which would give rise to an uncomfortable overbearing effect resulting in an increased sense of enclosure, loss of outlook and overshadowing harmful to the amenity of adjacent occupiers at Nos. 368 and 372 Wingletye Lane, contrary to Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD and Policies DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to the agent David Fernandez Blanco by email on 08/04/20."
