    "The proposed hip-to-gable roof alteration would alter the basic shape of the roof on the semi-detached house which is unacceptable as it would give rise to a visually heavy roof to one half of the semi-detached pair of properties, something which would have a negative effect on the street scene by creating a loss of symmetry between the two properties. The proposal is accordingly considered to be of a poor quality design and contrary to the purposes and intent of Local Plan Policies 7 and 26 as well as the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document.",
    "The proposed part single, part two storey side extension, by reason of its limited setback first floor level and flat roof design, would fail to be subservient to the host property and as such would be detrimental to the character and appearance of the host property and exacerbate the loss of symmetry between the pair of properties, contrary to Policies 7 and 26 of the Local Plan as well as the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, it was necessary to issue a decision as close to the statutory timeframe as possible as opposed to seeking amendments which would have significantly delayed the application."
