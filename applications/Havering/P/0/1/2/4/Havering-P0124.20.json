  "decision_conditions": [
    "Unless within 1 year of the date of this permission, the outbuilding is extended in accordance with the approved plans, the terrace area to the front of the existing building shall be removed from the site and ground returned to original level.",
    "Reason:-",
    "The retrospective part of this application for the existing outbuilding would not be approved in it's current form, but the proposal to extend it, enclosing over the current patio, would bring it into the realms of acceptability. Therefore the extension to the existing outbuilding would need to be completed sooner than the normal 3 years given to proposed use planning applications.  This is to ensure that there are no unreasonable amenity impacts such as loss of privacy to neighbouring properties from the creation of  a patio / veranda in front of the outbuilding at the rear of the property.",
    "The development hereby permitted shall not be carried out otherwise than in complete accordance with the approved plans (as set out on page one of this decision notice).",
    "Reason:-",
    "The Local Planning Authority consider it essential that the whole of the development is carried out and that no departure whatsoever is made from the details approved, since the development would not necessarily be acceptable if partly carried out or carried out differently in any degree from the details submitted.  Also, in order that the development accords with Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policy DC61.",
    "The proposed development hereby approved shall be constructed in accordance with the materials detailed under Section 5 of the application form unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason: To ensure that the appearance of the proposed development will harmonise with the character of the surrounding area and comply with Policy DC61 of the Development Control Policies Development Plan Document",
    "The outbuilding hereby permitted shall be used only for purposes incidental to the enjoyment of the dwelling house at 35 Lambourne Gardens, Hornchurch, as such, and not for any trade or business nor as living accommodation.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To restrict the use to one compatible with a residential area, and in order that the development accords with Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policy DC61.",
    "Please be advised that planning permission does not include Building Regulations approval and that as the outbuilding is more than 30 square metres in area, building regulation approval is required.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: In accordance with paragraph 38 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2018, improvements required to make the proposal acceptable were negotiated with Barry Charles (agent) via email. The revisions involved identifying the use of the outbuilding on the plans. The amendments were subsequently submitted on 6 April 2020."
