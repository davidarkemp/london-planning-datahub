    "The development hereby permitted shall not be carried out otherwise than in complete accordance with the approved plans (as set out on page one of this decision notice).",
    "Reason:-",
    "For the avoidance of doubt and to ensure that the development is carried out as approved.",
    "Within 1 month of this approval, details of the refuse and recycling facilities shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority. Provision shall be made for the storage of commercial waste and general waste within the premises ahead of collection and at no time shall any waste in association with the business use hereby permitted be stored outside of the premises.",
    "Reason:-",
    "Insufficient information has been supplied with the application to judge how refuse and recycling will be managed on site.  Submission of this detail prior to occupation in the case of new building works or prior to the use commencing in the case of changes of use will protect the amenity of occupiers of the development and also the locality generally and ensure that the development accords with Policies 26 and 35 of the Havering Local Plan 2016-2031",
    "No deliveries or collections shall be dispatched or received from the new service opening on the northern elevation for commercial unit A other than between the hours of 08:00 to 18:00 Monday to Friday, and not at all on Saturdays, Sundays, Bank or Public holidays without the prior consent in writing of the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To enable the Local Planning Authority to retain control in the interests of amenity, and in order that the development accords with Policies 7, 26 and 34 of the Havering Local Plan 2016-2031.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35(2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management) Order 2015: No significant problems were identified during the consideration of the application, and therefore it has been determined in accordance with paragraph 38 of the National Planning Policy Framework."
