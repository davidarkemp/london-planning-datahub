  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed loss of gym and its replacement within the ground floor of the block 4 to office use (restricted to the residents of the approved development) would significantly reduce the amenity provision for the future occupiers of the site and would erode the enjoyment of the both adult and children from recreational facility which would be available within the site for the future occupiers of the site, in this regards the proposal would be contrary to policies 12 and 18 of the Local Plan 2021.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to the agent on 28.04.2022."
