  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed garage block would, by reason of its bulk, mass and scale appear as an unacceptably dominant and visually intrusive feature in the street scene as well as the rear garden environment, harmful to the character and appearance of the surrounding area contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document, the Havering Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document and Policy D1 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "The proposed garage block would, by reason of its bulk, mass and scale located on the boundaries, be unneighbourly which would give rise to an uncomfortable and overbearing effect resulting in an increased sense of enclosure, loss of outlook and be harmful to neighbouring properties contrary to Policy DC61 of the London Borough of Havering LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD 2008, and the London Borough of Havering Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD 2011.",
    "The width of the proposed garages unit would not meet the standard car parking space dimension with the required  width of 3 metres. There would also be insufficient manoeuvring space to allow vehicles to enter and egress into the far garage contrary to Policy DC33 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document, the Havering Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document, Policy T6 of the London Plan 2021 and Manual for Streets.",
    "The proposed garage block would result in loss of on-street public car parking spaces that would be detrimental to general highway users contrary to DC36 of the London Borough of Havering LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD 2008.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to Mr Richard Stephenson via email on the 17th March 2021."
