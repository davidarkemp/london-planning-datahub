  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposal would, by reason of its positioning, height, scale, bulk and proximity to the nearby properties at the first floor flats at no.96 and no.100 North Street, be an intrusive, overbearing and unneighbourly development that would have a significant adverse effect on the amenities of these adjacent occupiers resulting in loss of light, loss of outlook and an increased sense of enclosure with an overbearing impact contrary to Policy 7 of the Havering Local Plan and the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document.",
    "The proposal would form an incongruous feature in the street-scene and would be conspicuous through its bulk and height which fails to take into account the character of the street and garden scene generally, and it would present as visually cramped within the site and prominent in the street scene.  The proposals would therefore be contrary to Policies 7 and 26 of the Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 and also the NPPF which requires fundamentally that development add to the overall quality of the area whilst also establishing or maintaining a strong sense of place.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, it was necessary to issue a decision as close to the statutory timeframe as possible as opposed to seeking amendments which would have significantly delayed the application."
