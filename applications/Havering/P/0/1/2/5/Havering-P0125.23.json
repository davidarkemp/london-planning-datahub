    "The proposed new dwelling by reason of the additional scale, bulk and mass of the proposal in close proximity to the boundary of boundary and the prominent corner location would appear as a visually intrusive and overbearing feature, resulting in a cramped appearance and over-development detrimental to the visual amenity of the locality contrary and to the high-quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policies D3 and D4 of The London Plan (2021) and Policies 7 and 26 of the Local Plan.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to the agent by email on 23/23/23.",
    "The proposal, if granted planning permission on appeal, would be liable for the Mayor of London and Havering Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). Based upon the information supplied with the application, the Mayoral CIL payable would be £2,375 based on the calculation of £25 per square metre and the Havering Community Infrastructure Levy (HCIL) would be £11,947 based based on calculation of £125.76 per square metre. Each would be subject to indexation.",
