  "description": "Proposed ground floor wrap-around extension and first floor rear extension.",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed rear extensions by reason of their bulk, scale and flat roof design over the first floor rear extension would significantly harm the architectural composition of the building, lacks subservience to the existing dwelling and would appear as a dominant, incongruous and visually intrusive form of development, thereby having an adverse effect to the appearance and character of the host dwelling and surrounding garden area, contrary to Policy DC61 of the London Borough of Havering LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD 2008 and the London Borough of Havering Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD 2011.",
    "The proposed extensions would, by reason of its excessive depth, height and bulk, be an intrusive and unneighbourly development which would give rise to an uncomfortable overbearing effect resulting in an increased sense of enclosure and loss of outlook harmful to the amenity of adjacent occupiers at No. 26 Honiton Road, contrary to Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD and Policies DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to Mr Halil Seker via email on the 22/03/21"
