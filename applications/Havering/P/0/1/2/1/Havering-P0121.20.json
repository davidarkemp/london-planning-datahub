    "The site is located in a relatively prominent location, where there are clear views to its rear elevation from street, the proposed extension incorporating a flat roof and projection beyond the existing two storey bay projection which form the main feature of the application building, would unacceptably compromise the architectural composition of the building and would form an incongruous design that lack subservience to the existing dwelling and would appear visually intrusive in the rear garden and front scene failing to maintain the characteristic design of the host property and wider area contrary to Policy DC61 of the London Borough of Havering's LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD 2008 and the London Borough of Havering Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD 2011.",
    "The proposed extension would, by reason of its scale, bulk, height and location on the boundary, would appear overbearing when viewed from the garden of the adjoining property and is considered harmful to the amenity of No. 4 Tring Gardens contrary to Policy DC61 of the London Borough of Havering LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD 2008, and the London Borough of Havering Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD 2011.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to Mr Alberto Ochoa by e-mail on 26/03/20."
