    "The proposed gabled roof would be incongruous, dominant and harmful to the character of the host dwelling as well as the overriding character of semi-detached bungalows with hipped roofs in St Albans Avenue. It will further unbalance the symmetry of the semi-detached pair, contrary to the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document, policies D1, D3 and D4 of The London Plan (2021) and Policies 7 and 26 of the Local Plan.",
    "The proposed front dormer would by reason of its overall bulk, mass, scale and design, appear incongruous, thereby causing visual harm to the character and appearance of the host dwelling and further unbalance the semi-detached pair. As such, the proposal is contrary to the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document, policies D1, D3 and D4 of The London Plan (2021) and Policies 7 and 26 of the Local Plan.",
