    "The proposed use in the absence of evidence otherwise would through the scale of the business operation, potential to increase in scale and intensity in the future and proximity to neighbouring residential dwellings result in unacceptable levels of noise and disturbance to the detriment of residential amenity and would therefore be contrary to Policies 12, 26 and 34 of the Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 as well as paragraph 130 of the NPPF which requires developments to ensure a high standard of amenity for existing and future users.",
    "The proposed business use through its potential to be accessed independently of the main dwelling and potential scale and intensity would be harmful to and would fundamentally alter the residential character of the locality and result in an intensification of the use of the site beyond that acceptable within a residential environment contrary to Policies 26 and 34 of the Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 and Paragraph 130 of the NPPF which amongst other things requires development add to the overall quality of the area and be sympathetic to local character. In addition there would be conflict with London Plan 2021 Policy D3 which requires that development enhance local context.",
    "The proposed use through the absence of any evidence to the contrary would fail to make adequate provision for the increased trip generation which could be controleld through plannign condition and any increased vehicle movement associated with the business operation would lead to increased parking stress and increased competition for on-street parking spaces therefore contrary to Polices 7, 23 and 24 of the Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 and also London Plan 2021 Policy T6.",
