    "The proposed development would, by reason of its inadequate internal floor to ceiling heights  give rise to a poor quality development and living conditions for future occupiers, contrary to the provisions of Policy D6 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies 7 and 26 of the Local Plan.",
    "The proposed development makes inadequate and impractical provision for parking within the site, leading to a poor arrangement of parking spaces which are unlikely to be desirable or practically suitable for use by future residents and which will obstruct and adversely affect accessibility to the donor property, compromising day to day functionality and leading to a poor quality living environment, contrary to the provisions of Policies 7, 24 and 26 of the Local Plan.",
    "In the event that this application is allowed through the appeals process, the proposals would be liable for the following CIL contributions:",
    "Mayoral CIL (MCIL2) contribution of £2,325 (x £25 per sqm).",
    "Havering CIL (HCIL) contribution of £11,625 (x £125 per sqm)",
    "Each contribution would be subject to indexation.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Improvements to the proposal to revise the internal and parking layouts layout were negotiated with the agent during the course of the application. However, these layouts were considered at detailed assessment stage to still be unacceptable. Further significant alteration would have been required to bring the development within the realms of acceptability so it was decided to proceed to determine the application."
