    "The application would - due to the housing typology of the existing building and the impact on the highway and road safety - fail to comply with the criteria set out in policies DC4 and DC5 of the Havering Core Strategy Development Control Policies and Development Control Document DPD 2008. As this is an inherent issue with the application site, and the explicit wording in policies DC4 and DC5, no conditions or obligations are able to overcome these policy issues, and the proposed development would be unacceptable.",
