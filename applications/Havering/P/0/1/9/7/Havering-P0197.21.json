  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed development would, by reason of the excessive depth close to the common boundary, have adverse amenity impacts to the neighbour at no. 85 Wingletye Lane resulting in a sense of enclosure and overbearing development for their outdoor amenity space in the rear garden which is considered to be unneighbourly and uncharacteristic of development locally, contrary to the Emerson Park Policy Area SPD, the Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD 2011 and Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD.",
    "The proposed rear extension would, by reason of the design with a partially flat and partially pitched roof would appear out of character,  incongruous and visually harmful to the host dwelling and the surrounding area, contrary to the Emerson Park Policy Area SPD, the Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD 2011 and Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to Mr Shaik Hussain (agent) via email on 7 April 2021."
