    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate that the proposed use would not give rise to a material impact on neighbouring amenity through the day-to-day operations associated with the use of the site, the storage and processing/mixing of aggregates within the building and from vehicle movement to and from it in a manner which would be consistent with the lawful use of the site. The proposals are considered not to comply with the objectives of Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 Policies 7, 33 and 34 as well as the objectives of the Framework, specifically Para 135 which amongst other considerations requires with a high standard of amenity for existing and future users.",
    "In the absence of any mechanism to secure necessary improvements to highway safety in this location and in the absence of compellling evidence otherwise the proposals would be detrimental to pedestrian and highway safety whilst also being detrimental to the existing road surface in particular East Hall Lane through generating activity on insufficient infrastructure. The proposals are therefore contrary to the objectives of Paragraph 116 of the National Planning Policy Framework and Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 Policy 23 which amongst other considerations requires that development make safe and efficient use of the highway and demonstrate that any adverse impacts on the transport network are avoided or, where necessary, mitigated",
