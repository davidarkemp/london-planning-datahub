    "The proposal has the potential to adversely impact the amenity of surrounding residents by way of noise associated with the use of the outdoor playground. An acoustic report should demonstrate that the use will not adversely impact surrounding residents within close proximity of the site. The proposed development is therefore contrary to Policies DC55 and DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD.",
    "Insufficient information has been submitted to demonstrate the layout of the outdoor play area in relation to the existing car parking and vehicle access area. In addition, the proposal fails to provide elevations of the proposed rear extension. No detail relating to cycle storage and waste storage has been provided on the submitted plans to demonstrate the acceptability of the proposal from this perspective. Insufficient details in the plans were provided relating to the kitchen to confirm its acceptability from a food safety perspective. Details relating to occupancy were not provided to demonstrate the acceptability of the sanitary facilities. The submitted plans indicate that the rooms will not have access to natural light or ventilation resulting in poor quality conditions for children. Based on the lack of information the proposal is unacceptable and fails to demonstrate compliance with the requirements of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to the agent in writing 9/7/20."
