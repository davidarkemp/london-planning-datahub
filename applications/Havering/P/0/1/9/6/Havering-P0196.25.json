    "The proposed development would by reason of its excessive depth, appear as an unduly obtrusive and prominent feature to the existing dwelling which would unbalance the appearance of this semi-detached pair and disrupting the relatively harmonious appearance and causing harm to its character in the street scene.  The development is therefore contrary to the Policy 26 of the Havering Local Plan and Supplementary Design Guidance (Residential Extensions and Alterations)."
