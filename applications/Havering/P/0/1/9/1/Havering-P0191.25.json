    "The proposed dwelling would, by reason of its positioning, scale, bulk and proximity to the nearby property at no.2 Grange Road, be an intrusive, overbearing and unneighbourly development with windows close to the shared boundary contrary to Policy 7 of the Havering Local Plan and the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document.",
    "There would be an inadequate outlook from the front of the building to the main habitable rooms due to the proximity to the site boundaries and parking areas, low ceiling heights and the amenity area for the existing flats would be poor.  There is likely to be noise and headlight glare disturbance from cars parked in front of the habitable room windows of the ground floor unit.  It is considered that the proposed development would result in a poor quality living environment for future and existing occupiers of the site, resulting in substandard residential accommodation to the detriment of the amenity of occupants.  The proposals would therefore be contrary to Policies 10, 7 and 26 of the Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 and Policy D6 of the London Plan.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, it was necessary to issue a decision as close to the statutory timeframe as possible as opposed to seeking amendments which would have significantly delayed the application.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reasons for it was given to the agent via email on 8.4.25.",
    "In the event that this application is allowed through the appeals process the proposals would be liable for the following CIL contributions:",
    "Mayoral CIL (MCIL2) contribution of £2775 (x £25 per sqm).",
    "Havering CIL (HCIL) contribution of £13,875 (x £125 per sqm).",
    "Each contribution would be subject to indexation."
