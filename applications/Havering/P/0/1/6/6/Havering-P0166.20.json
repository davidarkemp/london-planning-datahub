    "This site is located within an area identified in the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document as Metropolitan Green Belt.  The LDF and Government Guidance as set out in the NPPF states that inappropriate development should only be approved in very special circumstances.  The proposed dwelling would be materially larger than the building to which it is seeking to replace and accordingly is considered to be represent inappropriate development.  Inappropriate development is by definition harmful to the Green Belt and no very special circumstances have been advanced that clearly outweigh this and other identified harms.  Accordingly, the proposal is considered contrary to Policy DC45 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document and the provisions of the NPPF.",
    "The proposed development would, by reason of its height, bulk and mass, appear as an unacceptably dominant and visually intrusive feature in the streetscene harmful to the appearance of the surrounding area contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD.",
    "The proposed development would, by reason of its position and proximity to neighbouring properties cause overlooking and loss of privacy which would have a serious and adverse effect on the living conditions of adjacent occupiers, contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to the agent in writing 22/4/20.",
    "The proposal, if granted planning permission on appeal, would be liable for the Mayor of London Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). Based upon the information supplied with the application, the CIL payable would be £5187.5 for Havering CIL and £1037.5 for Mayoral CIL. Further details with regard to CIL are available from the Council's website."
