    "The site is within the area identified in the Havering Local Plan as Metropolitan Green Belt. Policy G2 of the London Plan and Government Guidance as set out in the National Planning Policy Framework (Green Belts) states that in order to achieve the purposes of the Metropolitan Green Belt it is essential to retain and protect the existing rural character of the area so allocated and that new development will only be permitted outside the existing built up areas in the most exceptional circumstances. The development is considered to be inappropriate in principle in the Green Belt and no very special circumstances have been provided to outweigh the harm caused by reason of inappropriateness and visual harm to the character and openness of the Green Belt. The height, scale, bulk, mass, siting and position close to the boundaries of the site of the barn is materially harmful to the open and spacious character of the Green Belt. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy G2 of the London",
    "In the absence of a biodiversity (Ecological) Survey and report, the applicant has not demonstrated if the barn has impacted on protected or priority species and has not resulted in significant adverse impacts on biodiversity which has not been effectively mitigated against contrary to Policies 27 and 30 of the Havering Local Plan, Policy G6 of the London Plan and the guidance contained in the National Planning Policy Framework.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to Wellsfield Associates via email on 3rd December 2024."
