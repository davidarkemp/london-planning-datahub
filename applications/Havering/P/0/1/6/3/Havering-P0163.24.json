    "The proposed flats due to their position would form an incongruous and visually cramped form of development at odds with surrounding pattern/character of the neighbouring buildings.  The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policy 26 of the Havering Local Plan 2016-2031, Policy D4 of the London Plan and also the guidance within the NPPF.",
    "The proposed development would result in living conditions that do not create a suitably high quality living environment for future occupiers. The constraints of the site in conjunction with the design approach adopted would be to the detriment of the amenity of future occupiers. The constrained plot and arrangement of living accommodation would result in poor aspect and outlook with the habitable room windows in close proximity of the existing and proposed flats would be substandard and give rise to an overwhelming sense of enclosure, in direct contrast to the aims of Policies 7 of the Havering Local Plan, Policy D6 of the London Plan 2021 and also the guidance within the NPPF.",
    "The proposal, by reason of poor quality and limited depth of the external amenity space, poor outlook and reliance on single aspect units, poor quality access and servicing arrangements for residents and exposure to noise and disturbance would, in combination, result in a poor quality living environment for future occupiers of the proposed development, which would be contrary to the provisions of Policy 7 of the Havering Local Plan, Policy D6 of the London Plan 2021 and also the guidance within the NPPF.",
    "The proposed development would, by reason of its layout, position and proximity to neighbouring flats cause overlooking and loss of privacy which would have a serious and adverse effect on the living conditions of adjacent occupiers, contrary to Policy 7 of the Havering Local Plan, Policy D6 of the London Plan 2021 and also the guidance within the NPPF.",
    "The proposal fails to demonstrate the site can suitably provide for cycle storage for the proposed flats, contrary to the provisions of Policy T5 of the London Plan and the Havering Local Plan.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to Mr Virdee by e-mail on 24/04/24.",
    "For Residential Development Only",
    "Please be advised that approval of this application from 1st September 2019 (either by London Borough of Havering, or subsequently by PINS if allowed on appeal following a refusal by London Borough of Havering) will attract a liability payment of £15,300 plus indexation in Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This charge has been levied under s.206 of the Planning Act 2008 and includes both the Mayor of London's CIL and Havering Council's CIL.",
    "London Borough of Havering, as CIL collecting authority, has responsibility for the collection of the Mayoral CIL, in addition to Havering's CIL, on commencement of the development.",
    "Your proposal is subject to a CIL Liability Notice indicating a levy of £15,300 plus indexation for the application, based on the Mayoral CIL levy rate for Havering of £25/sq.m plus Havering's charging rate for residential of £125/sq.m (Zone A), and the floorspace of 102 square metres.",
