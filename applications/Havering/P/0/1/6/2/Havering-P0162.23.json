    "The cumulative impact of the first floor side extension and hip to gable roof alteration would be out of scale, disproportionately large, overly prominent and relate unacceptably to the existing dwelling, resulting in a top heavy appearance that would appear as an unacceptably dominant and visually intrusive feature in the street scene, harmful to the appearance of the surrounding area, contrary to Policy 7 of the Havering Local Plan and the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document.",
    "The proposed first floor side extension would, by reason of its height, scale, bulk and proximity to the neighbouring property no. 118 Beauly Way, be an intrusive, overbearing and unneighbourly development that would have a significant adverse effect on the amenities of these adjacent occupiers contrary to Policy 7 of the Havering Local Plan and the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document.",
