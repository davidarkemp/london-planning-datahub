    "The cumulative impact of the proposed side and rear extensions including the hip to gable roof conversion and  2 front dormer windows would unbalance the appearance of this pair of semi-detached bungalows and appear as an unacceptably dominant and visually intrusive feature in the street scene and would compromise the open character of this side of Eversleigh Gardens harmful to the appearance of the surrounding area, contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document, the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document and Policy 7.4 of the London Plan.",
    "The proposed development, by reason of the scale, bulk, depth and mass of the first floor rear projection, combined with the scale of the alterations to the roof, would be an intrusive and overbearing form of development within the rear garden environment, harmful to local character and amenity and contrary to the provisions of Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document, the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document and Policy 7.4 of the London Plan.",
