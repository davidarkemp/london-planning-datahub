    "The proposed first floor front extension, by reason of its bulk, scale and massing forms a dominant and visually intrusive feature in a prominent location, detrimental to the character as well as the appearance of the property and materially harmful to the visual amenity of the surrounding area contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document, the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document and Policy D1 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "The proposed first floor front extension would, by reason of its excessive height, mass and position close to the northern boundary of the site, be an intrusive and unneighbourly development as well as having an adverse effect on the amenities of adjacent occupiers contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document, the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document and Policy D1 of the London Plan.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to Mr Paul Robinson via email on 17th March 2021."
