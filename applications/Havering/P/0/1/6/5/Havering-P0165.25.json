    "The proposed double storey side extension would, by reason of its excessive  scale, bulk, mass and lack of set back at first floor level would unacceptably unbalance the appearance of this pair of semi-detached house and appear as a dominant and visually intrusive feature and harmful to the appearance of the surrounding area, contrary to Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document and Policies 26 of the Havering Local Plan and D4 of the London Plan.",
    "The proposed single storey rear extension would, by reason of its excessive height, depth and position close to the boundaries of the site, be an intrusive and unneighbourly development as well as having an adverse effect on the amenities of adjacent occupiers contrary to Policies 7 of the Havering Local Plan and the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document.",
