    "The proposed rear extension would by reason of its combined depth and footprint at the shared boundary with the attached neighbour form an intrusive and unneighbourly development as well as creating an oppressive boundary which would have an adverse effect on the amenities of adjacent occupiers contrary to Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 Policies 7, 26 and 34 and the objectives of the Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD.",
