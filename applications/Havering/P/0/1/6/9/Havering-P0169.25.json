    "The cumulative impact of the hip to gable roof alteration and rear dormer window when viewed in conjunction with the existing two storey side extension would be out of scale and character, be disproportionately large, overly prominent and relate unacceptably to the existing dwelling with a top heavy appearance which would unbalance the appearance of this pair of semi-detached and appear as an unacceptably dominant, incongruous and visually intrusive feature in the surrounding area, contrary to Policy 26 of the Havering Local Plan, D4 of the London Plan, the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document, as well as the NPPF which requires fundamentally that development add to the overall quality of the area.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to Mr Thapa (Agent) by e-mail on 08/04/25."
