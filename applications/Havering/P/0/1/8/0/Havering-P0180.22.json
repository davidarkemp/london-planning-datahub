  "description": "Resubmission for the erection of an outbuilding north-east of the main dwelling to provide a workshop, storage, and an open garage space with proposed landscaping works to the rest of the site to improve biodiversity and the setting of the listed building.",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The site is  identified in the Local Plan as being within the Metropolitan Green Belt.  Government Guidance as set out in the NPPF states that in order to achieve the purposes of the Metropolitan Green Belt it is essential to retain and protect the existing rural character of the area so allocated and that the new development will only be permitted outside the existing built-up areas in the most exceptional circumstances. The proposal by reason of its significant adverse impact on openness is considered to be inappropriate development and as such would be harmful to the Green Belt. The proposals, therefore, fail to comply with the NPPF, in particular, paragraph 149 and is also contrary to Policy G2 of the London Plan.",
    "The proposed outbuilding given its bulk, scale, massing and proximity to the Listed Building, would result in an unsympathetic development that would fail to preserve the setting and open character of the listed building and that of its significance as a heritage asset. Furthermore, the cumulative impact of these proposals and nearby recent development to the north, would further exacerbate the encroachment on the inherent open character of the listed building. The proposal fails to preserve the setting and open character of the listed building, contrary to the advice in the NPPF and Policy 26 and 28 of the Local Plan 2016-2031.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to Mr L Nicholson (agent) by email on 05/04/21."
