    "The proposed annex, by reason of its bulk, scale, mass and height, would appear as an overly dominant, incongruous and visually intrusive feature in the rear garden environment, harmful to the appearance of the surrounding area, contrary to Policy 7 of the Local Plan and the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document.",
    "The proposed annex, by reason of its height, depth, position and proximity to neighbouring properties nos. 14 and 18 Newmarket Way, would cause perceived and direct overlooking and a loss of privacy which would have a serious and adverse effect on the living conditions of these adjoining occupiers, contrary to the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document and Policy 7 of the Local Plan.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to the agent by e-mail on 24/04/2023.",
    "Notwithstanding the submitted plans hereby conceded, they do not adequately reflect the current situation at the application site. Specifically, there is a significant drop in ground level from the host dwelling down into the rear garden and the ground level at the very back of the rear garden has also been raised. There also appears to be a raised patio area in-situ behind the rear extension. The applicant is thus advised that planning permission is required for these developments."
