  "decision_conditions": [
    "The development to which this permission relates must be commenced not later than three years from the date of this permission.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To comply with the requirements of Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended by Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004).",
    "The development hereby permitted shall not be carried out otherwise than in complete accordance with the approved plans (as set out on page one of this decision notice).",
    "Reason:-",
    "For the avoidance of doubt and to ensure that the development is carried out as approved.",
    "The premises shall not be used for the purposes hereby permitted other than between the hours of 09:00 and 23:00  on Mondays to Saturdays and 11:00 and 21:00 on Sundays, Bank or Public holidays without the prior consent in writing of the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To enable the Local Planning Authority to retain control in the interests of amenity, and in order that the development accords with Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policy DC61.",
    "Before the use commences, suitable equipment to remove and/or disperse odours and odorous material should be fitted to the extract ventilation system in accordance with a scheme to be designed and certified by a competent engineer and after installation a certificate to be lodged with the Planning Authority.  Thereafter, the equipment shall be properly maintained and operated within design specifications during normal working hours.",
    "Reason:-",
    "Insufficient information has been supplied with the application to judge the technical specifications of the extract ventilation system.  Submission of this detail prior to commencement of the use will protect the amenity of occupiers of nearby premises and ensure that the development accords with Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policy DC61.",
    "Before the use commences, the building shall be insulated in accordance with a scheme which shall previously have been approved by the Local Planning Authority in order to secure a reduction in the level of noise emanating from the building.",
    "Reason:  Insufficient information has been supplied with the application with regards to insulation. Submission of this detail prior to commencement of the use will prevent noise nuisance to adjoining/adjacent properties, protect the amenity of occupiers of nearby premises and ensure that the development accords with Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policy DC61.",
    "Before the development hereby permitted commences,  details of a scheme shall be submitted to and approved in writing by  the Local Planning Authority which specifies the provisions to be made for the control of noise emanating from the site. Such scheme as may be approved shall be implemented prior to first occupation and thereafter retained in accordance with such details.",
    "Reason:  Insufficient information has been supplied with the application with regards to a scheme to control noise emanating from the site. Submission of this detail prior to commencement of the use will prevent noise nuisance to adjoining/adjacent properties, protect the amenity of occupiers of nearby premises and ensure that the development accords with Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policy DC61.",
    "Before any works commence, a scheme for any new plant or machinery shall be submitted to the Local Planning Authority to achieve the following standard. Noise levels expressed as the equivalent continuous sound level LAeq (1 hour) when calculated at the boundary with the nearest noise sensitive premises shall not exceed LA90 -10dB and shall be maintained thereafter to the satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:  Insufficient information has been supplied with the application with regards to a scheme for any new plant or machinery. Submission of this detail prior to commencement of the use will prevent noise nuisance to adjoining/adjacent properties, protect the amenity of occupiers of nearby premises and ensure that the development accords with Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policy DC61.",
    "No building shall be occupied or use commenced until refuse and recycling facilities are provided in accordance with details which shall previously have been submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority. The refuse and recycling facilities shall be permanently retained thereafter.",
    "Reason:-",
    "Insufficient information has been supplied with the application to judge how refuse and recycling will be managed on site.  Submission of this detail prior to occupation in the case of new building works or prior to the use commencing in the case of changes of use will protect the amenity of occupiers of the development and also the locality generally and ensure that the development accords with the Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policy DC61.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: In accordance with paragraph 38 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2018, improvements required to make the proposal acceptable were negotiated with Stephensons on the telephone on 6th April 2021. The revisions involved changing the opening hours of the premises. Confirmation of the revised opening hours was received via email on 6th April 2021.",
    "A fee is required when submitting details pursuant to the discharge of conditions.  In order to comply with the Town and Country Planning (Fees for Applications, Deemed Applications, Requests and Site Visits) (England) Regulations 2012, (as amended), a fee of £116 per request or £34 where the related permission was for extending or altering a dwellinghouse, is needed."
