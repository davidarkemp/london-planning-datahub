  "decision_conditions": [
    "The site is within the Metropolitan Green Belt and the proposed development would not align fully with any of the exceptions set out in Section 13 of the NPPF and would therefore be comprised of inappropriate development. The redevelopment of the site as proposed would form an unwanted urbanisation of the site which would have a profound and material impact on the openness of the Green Belt in this location and would conflict with the purposes of including land within it. In the absence of any Very Special Circumstances which would outweigh the harm of inappropriateness and harm to openness the proposed development is unacceptable in principle and in contrast to the objectives of the NPPF (as revised December 2024) and Policy G2 of the London Plan 2021",
    "In the absence of a mechanism to secure such as a S278 or confirmation that the relocation of the bus-stop would be acceptable, the proposals are unable to provide vehicular access to the site and therefore adequate off-street parking provision could not be made, contrary to the objectives of Havering Local Plan  2016-2031 Policies 7, 23 and 24 and the objectives of the Framework.",
    "The proposal fails to make provision for affordable housing and in the absence of any means to secure provision of affordable housing, such as through a legal agreement or any justification or mitigation measures to adequately justify the lack of on site provision the proposal is contrary to the provisions of Policy 4 of the Havering Local Plan 2016-2031.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to the applicant in writing 06-06-2025",
    "The proposal, if granted planning permission on appeal, would be liable for the Havering Community infrastructure Levy (HCIL) and Mayoral Community Infrastructure Levy (MCIL). Based upon the information supplied with the application, the Levy payable are (subject to indexation).",
    "The proposals concern the formation of a dwelling with approx 269 sqm of new gross internall floor area which equates to the following contributions under the CIL regulations.",
    "Havering CIL (125 per sqm) - £33,625",
    "Mayoral CIL (25 per sqm) - £6,725",
    "Further details with regard to CIL are available from the councils website."
