    "The proposed development would, by reason of its bulk, design, appearance and siting, fail to integrate acceptably with the host dwelling and would appear as an anomaly within the wider street scene. Readily visible from such a prominent location, this development would be visually intrusive, and out of scale and character with the established building line and pattern of development in the surrounding environment. It is therefore harmful to the appearance of the site and surrounding area contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD.",
    "The proposed development would, by reason of its width, massing, appearance, prominent siting in relation to Southern Arterial Road and siting on its plot boundaries result in a cramped form of development which would adversely impact on visual amenity in the street scene contrary to Policies DC3 and DC61 of the London Borough of Havering Core Strategy and  Development Control Policies Development Plan Document 2008, and criteria contained in the Adopted London Borough of Havering  SPD on Residential Design 2010 .",
    "The proposed development, by reason of its inadequate level of privacy, lack of private amenity space, significant level of noise/smell, general disturbance and  internal floorspace standards for the ground floor flat, providing a constrained and sub-standard residential accommodation for future occupiers which would adversely impact on their living condition, contrary to the aims and objectives of London Plan Policy D6 and Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD.",
    "In the absence of a full Tree Survey, the proposed development would result in the removal and/or harm to trees on/adjacent site, which would be materially harmful to the character and amenity of site and surrounding area, contrary to Policies DC60 and DC61 of the Local Development Framework Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document and the Protection of Trees during Development Supplementary Planning Document.",
    "The proposed development would, by reason of the loss of garage and the unsatisfactory parking arrangement would adversely impact on the living condition of occupiers at no. 55 Farnes Drive and prospective occupiers of the proposed development, and result in an unacceptable overspill onto the adjoining roads to the detriment of highway safety and residential amenity, contrary to Policy DC33 of the LDF Development Control Policies Development Plan Document.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to Mr. Jon Welch via email on 20th July 2021.",
    "The proposal, if granted planning permission on appeal, would be liable for the Council and the Mayor of London Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). Based upon the information supplied with the application, the CIL payable would be £20,850. Further details with regard to CIL are available from the Council's website."
