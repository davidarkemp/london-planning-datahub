    "The level of prospective occupancy and scale and nature of the use proposed would materially change the character of the subject property and the surrounding environment. This would present in increased comings and goings to the site which would be over and above what could be regarded as acceptable and which would be detrimental to local character and the amenity of adjoining and nearby occupiers contrary to Policies 6, 7 and 34 of the Havering Local Plan, Policies H12, S1 and S2 of the London Plan and the objectives of the National Planning Policy Framework 2023.",
    "The applicant has not demonstrated that proposed use would not lead to increased comings and goings to the site over and above that of a single dwelling house and that an adequate degree of visitor and carer parking facilities would be provided. Therefore as a consequence this would result in an adverse impact on the safety and convenience of the local highway network through exacerbating pedestrian-vehicular conflict along pavements and traffic congestion within the area. As such there would be conflict with Policy 6 of the Havering Local Plan 2016-2031, Policy T6 of the London Plan as well as the objectives of the NPPF 2023.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, it was necessary to issue a decision as close to the statutory timeframe as possible as opposed to seeking amendments which would have significantly delayed the application."
