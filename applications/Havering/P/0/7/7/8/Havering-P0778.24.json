    "The resultant arrangement would be detrimental to the residential amenity of future occupants of Plot 7 (P0413.23, that dwelling closest to the southern boundary fronting Havering Road), outlook from internal and external spaces would be confined and enclosed as a result of both the proposed extension and reduced plot size and width. The proposals would not achieve a suitable standard of accommodation compliant with the objectives of Policy D6 of the London Plan 2021, Policy 7 of the Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 and the objectives of the Framework at Para 135 for those occupants.",
    "The proposed extensions and alterations to the site layouts would reduce the plot size of Plot 7 (P0413.23, that being the dwelling closest to the southern boundary fronting Havering Road) and would diminish the qualities of the scheme which had made it acceptable. The resultant layout would visually cramped and at odds with surrounding local character. In this regard the proposals are contrary to the guidance set out in the Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD, and the polices Policies 7 and 26 set in Havering Local Plan 2016-2031, as well as the NPPF which requires fundamentally at Para 135 that development add to the overall quality of the area and maintain a strong sense of place.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to the agent in writing 23-08-2024",
    "The proposal, if granted planning permission on appeal, would be liable for the Mayor of London and Havering Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). Based upon the information supplied with the application, the Mayoral CIL payable would be £2,825 based on the calculation of £25.00 per square metre and the Havering Community Infrastructure Levy (HCIL) would be a charge of £14,125 based on calculation of £125 per square metre. Each would be subject to indexation (113 sqm gross new).",
