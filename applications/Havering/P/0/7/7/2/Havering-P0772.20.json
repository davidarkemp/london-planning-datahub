    "The proposed development would, by reason of its excessive depth, height and proximity to common boundaries, appear as an unacceptably dominant and overbearing development to the detriment of both adjoining neighbours and be a visually intrusive feature in the rear garden scene harmful to the appearance of the surrounding area and character, which is contrary to the Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD 2011 and Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD.",
    "The proposed development would, by reason of its excessive depth, height and proximity to common boundaries, have a significant and detrimental impact to the amenities of both adjoining neighbours at nos. 86 and 90 Beauly Way for the enjoyment of their rear outdoor amenity space and rooms to the rear of the house regarding overshadowing, loss of access to sunlight and daylight, sense of enclosure and an overbearing feel, which is contrary to the Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD 2011 and Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD.",
