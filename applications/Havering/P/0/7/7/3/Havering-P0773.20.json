  "site_name": "34 Briscoe Road",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed development would, by reason of its size, height, scale, position and proximity to neighbouring properties be an intrusive and overbearing development, particularly at nos. 32 - 36 Briscoe Road and 21 - 31 King Edward Avenue, which would have a serious and adverse effect on the living conditions of adjacent occupiers, contrary to the NPPF and Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD.",
    "The proposed development would, by reason of its size, scale, location and reduced plot size create development would be against the general pattern of the development in the area and would appear uncharacteristically cramped on the site, which would have serious and adverse effects on the appearance and character of the local area and streetscene contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD.",
    "The proposal would result in an unsatisfactory provision of amenity space for future occupiers of the development, which is directly overlooked by the donor property, and is poorly designed with habitable room windows facing directly on to the west, giving restricted light and outlook to the unit. The proposal therefore achieves a poor standard of design and residential amenity and is therefore contrary to the NPPF, London Plan Policy 3.5, the London Housing SPG 2016, Council's policy DC61 and the Council's Residential Design SPD.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to the applicant's agent via email on 28 July 2019.",
    "The proposal, if granted planning permission on appeal, would be liable for the Mayor of London Community Infrastructure Levy (MCIL) and Havering CIL (HCIL). Based upon the information supplied with the application, the Mayoral CIL payable would be £1,850.00 and the Havering CIL £9,250.00, or a total liability of £11,100, both amounts subject to indexation.",
    "Further details with regard to CIL are available from the Council's website."
