    "The site is within the Metropolitan Green Belt and the proposed development would not align fully with any of the exceptions set out in Section 13 of the NPPF and would therefore be comprised of inappropriate development. The proposed development would also, through the provision of domestic garden paraphernalia associated with residential dwellings in the northern part of the site, diminish the open character of the Green Belt and therefore have an adverse impact on its openness, conflicting with the purposes of including land within it. In the absence of any Very Special Circumstances which would outweigh the harm of inappropriateness and harm to openness, the proposed development is unacceptable in principle and in contrast to the objectives of the NPPF and Policy G2 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "The proposed development fails to make provision for affordable housing and in the absence of any means to secure provision of affordable housing, such as through a legal agreement or any justification or mitigation measures to adequately justify the lack of on site provision, the proposed development is contrary to the objectives of the NPPF and the provisions of Policy 4 of the Havering Local Plan.",
    "The provision of a terraced row of dwellings within the site would be at odds with prevailing patterns of development and would not reflect the character of detached dwellings in the wider surrounding area. The proposed development would therefore be contrary to Policies 7 and 26 of the Havering Local Plan and also Paragraph 135 of the NPPF which requires fundamentally that development add to the overall quality of the area whilst also establishing or maintaining a strong sense of place and be sympathetic to local character and history, including the surrounding built environment and landscape setting.",
    "The proposed development, by reason of its landscaping strategy and orientation, would result in dwellings that provide poor outlook from the ground floor kitchens and first floor bedrooms of the proposed dwellings 2, 3 and 4 and also fail to provide a convenient walking access route to parking spaces for the future occupants of dwellings 2, 3 and 4, thereby resulting in a scheme of a low quality design that would be to the detriment of future occupants, contrary to the provisions of Policy D6 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy 7 of the Havering Local Plan.",
    "Insufficient information has been submitted as part of the application for the ecological impacts of the proposed dwellings to be assessed, contrary to Policies 10 and 27 of the Havering Local Plan and Policy G7 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "The proposal, if granted planning permission on appeal, would be liable for the Mayor of London and Havering Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). Based upon the information supplied with the application, the proposals would be liable for the following CIL contributions:",

    "Havering CIL (HCIL) contribution of £57,000 (x £125 per sqm)",
    "Each contribution would be subject to indexation.",
    "Further details with regard to CIL are available from the Council's website.",
