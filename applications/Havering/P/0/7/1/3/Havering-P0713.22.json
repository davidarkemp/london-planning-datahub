    "The proposed part single, part two storey side extension, by reason of its lack of set back at first floor level from the front elevation, fails to be subservient in design and so would be detrimental to the character and appearance of the host property and visual amenity of the streetscene, contrary to Policy 7 of the Local Plan and the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document.",
    "The proposed roof alterations would not be subservient to the roof of the property, would alter the basic shape of the roof on the semi-detached house which is unacceptable as it would lead to an imbalance between the pair and create a visually heavy roof to one half causing a negative effect on the street scene by the loss of symmetry. Accordingly the proposal is of a poor quality design which is contrary to the purposes and intent of Local Plan Policy 7 and the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document.",
