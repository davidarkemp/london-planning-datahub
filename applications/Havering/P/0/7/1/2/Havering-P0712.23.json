    "The existing and the proposed development, by reasons of the substandard provision of residential accommodation with particular reference to the cramped internal layout and its relationship to the site boundaries (east and west) with insufficient internal floorspace, inadequate light and poor outlook from habitable room windows, with perceived overlooking/loss of privacy would create an unacceptable living environment which would be detrimental to the amenity of the existing/future occupiers and the character of the surrounding area contrary to Policy D6 of the London Plan and Policy 7 of the Local Plan. The proposal would also be contrary to the implementation of the DCLG Technical Housing Standards - Nationally Described Space Standard March 2015.",
