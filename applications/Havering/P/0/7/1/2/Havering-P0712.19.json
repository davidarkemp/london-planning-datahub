    "The proposal would, by reason of its unsympathetic design, massing and detailing, result in unacceptable harm to the intrinsic character of the host premises; and would, therefore, neither preserve nor enhance the special character of this part of the Conservation Area, and that the harm identified would not be outweighed by any public benefits arising from the proposals. The development sought is contrary to Policies DC61 and DC68 of the Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document, the Heritage SPD and the guidance in the NPPF.",
    "The proposed development would, by reason of its height, bulk and mass, appear as an unacceptably dominant and visually intrusive feature in the adjacent garden scene and harmful to the appearance of the surrounding area contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to the agent via e-mail on the 11-07-19."
