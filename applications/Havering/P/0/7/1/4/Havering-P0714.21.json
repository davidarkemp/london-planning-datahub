    "The proposed development, by reason of its inadequate internal floorspace standards would be constrained, providing a sub-standard residential accommodation for future occupiers which would adversely impact on their living condition, contrary to the aims and objectives of London Plan Policy D6 and Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD.",
    "The proposed dwellings given the constraints of the site would appear as a cramped  form of development within the streetscene and the rear garden environment, entirely out of character with the established pattern of development in the surrounding environment and therefore harmful to the character and appearance of site and the surrounding area contrary to Policy DC61 of the Local Development Framework Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document.",
    "The proposed dwelling is considered by its sitting and proximity to the boundaries of the site, would appear unacceptably dominant and overbearing resulting in a visually intrusive feature and detrimental impact on the residential amenity of no.52 and no.54 Faircross Avenue contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, it was necessary to issue a decision as close to the statutory timeframe as possible as opposed to seeking amendments which would have significantly delayed the application.",
    "The proposal, if granted planning permission on appeal, would be liable for the Mayor of London Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and Havering CIL. Based upon the information supplied with the application, the CIL payable would be £500 and £2,500. Each would be subject to indexation. Further details with regard to CIL are available from the Council's website."
