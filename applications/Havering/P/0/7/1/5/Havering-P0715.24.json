    "The proposed dwelling would, by reason of its design, built form, location within the rear garden environment of Cecil Avenue and amenity layout, appear as an isolated form of development that would be at odds with the established local pattern of development in the rear gardens of Cecil Avenue and the established design of dwellings along Harwood Avenue, contrary to Policies 7, 10 and 26 of the Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 as well as Paragraph 135(d) of the NPPF which requires fundamentally that development add to the overall quality of the area whilst also establishing or maintaining a strong sense of place.",
    "The proposed development would, by reason of its limited storage space, floor-to-ceiling heights and poor outlook from bedroom 3, result in a low quality design that would be to the detriment of future occupants, contrary to the provisions of Policy D6 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies 7 and 10 of the Havering Local Plan 2016-2031.",
    "The proposed dwelling, by reason of its close proximity to the common boundary with no. 85 Cecil Avenue, would form a visually intrusive and overbearing feature from adjacent rear garden of this neighbouring property that would result in loss of light and overshadowing to these neighbouring occupants and cause overlooking and loss of privacy to nos. 83 to 87 Cecil Aveue from its first floor bedroom window, contrary to Policies 7 and 10 of the Havering Local Plan 2016-2031. There would also be conflict with paragraph 135(f) of the National Planning Policy Framework which seeks to ensure a high standard of amenity for existing and future occupiers.",

    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal was given to the agent via email on 02/08/2024."
