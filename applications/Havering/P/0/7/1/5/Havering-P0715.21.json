    "The proposed two storey extension would, by reason of its excessive scale, height and the proximity to the northern shared boundary, be unneighbourly which would give rise to an uncomfortable and overbearing effect resulting in an increased sense of enclosure and outlook, and be materially harmful to the amenity of the northern neighbouring property, no. 26 Hamlet Road, contrary to Policy DC61 of the London Borough of Havering LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD 2008, and the London Borough of Havering Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD 2011.",
