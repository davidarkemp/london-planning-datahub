    "The erection of a four bedroom dwelling would result in substantial  harm to Ivy Holt by crowding the grade II listed house whilst irrevocably losing the ability to experience the asset within the generous plot for which it was designed and constructed. The proposed development would therefore be harmful to the setting of a Grade II Listed Building and contrary to Policies CP18, DC61 and DC67 of the of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD, Heritage SPD, Policy 7.8 of the London Plan (as amended), s66 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 and section 16 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2018.",
    "The proposed development would, by reason of its size, design and appearance, result in unsympathetic, visually intrusive development. The harm to the Conservation Area can be perceived as a detrimental impact upon the character and appearance of the area by undermining key views, the quality of built environment as well as the settlement plan form and the setting of key heritage assets within the conservation area contrary to Policies DC61 and DC68 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD, s72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 and the guidance in the National Planning Policy Framework 2018.",
    "The proposal, if granted planning permission on appeal, would be liable for the Mayor of London Community Infrastructure Levy (MCIL) and Havering CIL (HCIL). Based upon the information supplied with the application, the Mayoral CIL payable would be £3,800 and the Havering CIL £19,000, or a total liability of £22,800 both amounts subject to indexation.",
    "Further details with regard to CIL are available from the Council's website.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to John Kershaw via email on 17th July 2019"
