    "The proposed development would, by reason of its excessive height, bulk and mass, visually intrusive roof form and lack of a set back to its front elevation would appear as an unacceptably dominant and visually intrusive feature in the streetscene harmful to the character and appearance and openness of this prominent corner plot and surrounding area contrary to Local Plan policies 7 and 26, the London Plan 2021 and the NPPF.",
    "The proposal by reason of the removal of the rear vehicular access to the donor property would likely result in that property using its front forecourt for vehicular parking which is adjacent to the junction with Fontayne Avenue and would increase road danger and impact on the safe operation of the surrounding highway network contrary to London Plan policy D4 and Local Plan policies 23 and 24.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to the Agent by email on the 12/07/2022.",
    "The proposed development will create 1 new residential unit with 96sqm of new gross internal floorspace. The proposal is liable for LB Havering CIL and will incur a charge of £12,000 (subject to indexation) based on the calculation of £125.00 per square metre. The proposal is also liable for Mayoral CIL and will incur a charge of £2,400 (subject to indexation) based on the calculation of £25.00 per square metre. Each would be subject to indexation.",
