    "To comply with the requirements of Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended by Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004).",
    "The development hereby permitted shall not be carried out otherwise than in complete accordance with the approved plans (as set out on page one of this decision notice).",

    "For the avoidance of doubt and to ensure that the development is carried out as approved.",
    "The proposed development hereby approved shall be constructed in accordance with the materials detailed under Section 8 of the application form unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason: To ensure that the appearance of the proposed development will harmonise with the character of the surrounding area and comply with Policy DC61 of the Development Control Policies Development Plan Document",
    "Notwithstanding the provisions of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 the outbuilding hereby permitted shall be used only for purposes as a garage for residential car parking use for no. 527 Rush Green Road and not for any trade or business nor as living accommodation.",

    "This planning permission would not remove the need to observe any other property law which the land may be subject to. And there may be a need to seek any other agreement or consent of the owner of others which may have an interest on the land in particular with reference to the right of access over this land. This is a matter of civil law between the parties, and the Local Planning Authority are not involved in such matters."
