    "The proposal would, by reason of its form, scale and mass, would be visually intrusive, harmful to the character and appearance of this heritage asset and the streetscene and would fail to preserve or enhance the Gidea Park  Conservation Area contrary to Policies 26 and 28 of the adopted Havering Local Plan and the Heritage Supplementary Planning Document and the NPPF.  Section 72 (1) of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 is relevant. Regarding the NPPF, a low level of less than substantial harm to the significance of the conservation area is envisaged.  The rear proposed extension and roof changes would adversely affect the architectural interest of a non-designated heritage asset, which makes the application subject to Paragraph 209 of the NPPF.",
    "The proposed extension and roof changes with a balcony would, by reason of their positioning, scale, bulk and proximity to the nearby properties at no.6 and no.10 Reed Pond Walk, be an intrusive, overbearing and unneighbourly development that would have a significant adverse effect on the amenities of these adjacent occupiers resulting in an increased sense of enclosure with an overbearing impact and overshadowing contrary to Policy 7 of the Havering Local Plan and the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document.",
    "The lack of arboricultural information or assessment with the application may lead to a detrimental impact on trees in and near the site to the detriment of the greenery and appearance of the street scene and the Gidea Park  Conservation Area contrary to Policies 26, 27 and 28 of the adopted Havering Local Plan.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, it was necessary to issue a decision as close to the statutory timeframe as possible as opposed to seeking amendments which would have significantly delayed the application."
