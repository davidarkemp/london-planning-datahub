    "It has not been demonstrated that the expansion of the self-storage use into the exernal areas of the site would be appropriate in this location and that there would not be be potential for increased noise and disturbance conspicuously different to any previous use of this part of the site at the southern boundary where there are residential units bordering the site. Through a combination of the levels of potential activity, uncertainty over noise from comings/goings and use of the roller shutter doors in the absence of a compelling case otherwise the development is contrary to the objectives of Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 Policies 13 and 34 through being detrimental to the amenity of surrounding occupiers. There would also be conflict with the objectives of the NPPF, in particular Para 135 which requires development to provide a high standard of amenity for existing and future users and not undermine community cohesion.",
    "The applicant has not demonstrated that the site would be able to accommodate parking demand to the satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority through the expansion of the self-storage use into external areas of the site and the loss of existing parking bays. Furthermore it has not been demonstrated that vehicles and those attending the site would be able to safely manoeuvre within the site at the rear where the units have been sited. There is no evidence that any overspill demand would not lead to increase parking stress within surrounding roads. The proposals would therefore be contrary to Policies 23 and 24 of the Havering Local Plan, Policy T6 of the London Plan, and to the objectives of the NPPF specifically Para 115.",
