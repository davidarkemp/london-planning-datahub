    "The proposed vehicular crossover would, by reason of its size, siting and proximity to the TfL bus lane and the junction with Riverside Close, would result in a continuous dropped kerb in excess of  20 metres together with the resultant increased vehicular entry and egress from the site would increase road danger and be detrimental to pedestrian safety and the safe operation of the surrounding highway network. The proposals would be harmful to visual amenity within the streetscene and also result in the overprovision of car parking and present a barrier for inclusive access to the development and for the provision of cycle parking thereby failing to promote sustainable modes of transport contrary to Local Plan policies 23 and 24, London Plan (2021) policies D5, T2, T4, T5, T6, The Mayors Transport Strategy (2018) and paragraph 111 of the NPPF (2021).",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to the Agent by email on the 15/08/22."
