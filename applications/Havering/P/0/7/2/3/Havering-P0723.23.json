    "The proposed single storey rear extension due to its excessive depth and mass to the common boundary with No. 71 The Grove would result in an overbearing form of development, cause a significant loss of outlook, an increased sense of enclosure and would reduce the availability of natural sunlight into the rear the neighbour's dwelling to the detriment of their ongoing amenity.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: In accordance with paragraph 38 of the National Planning Policy Framework, improvements required to make the proposal acceptable were negotiated with the agent via email on 05/06/2023.  The revisions involved reducing the depth of the rear extension to reduce the impact on the amenity of neighbours.  The applicant declined to make the suggested revisions."
