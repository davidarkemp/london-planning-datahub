    "The development by reason of the siting of the property and the nature of the use as a large HMO with high occupancy and very poor access to public transport, would result in significantly higher levels of comings / goings and intensive activity over and above that of a single dwelling house or small HMO resulting in a detrimental impact to the amenity of adjoining residents from noise and disturbance associated. The proposals would therefore be contrary to Policies 7 and 8 of the Havering Local Plan 2021. For the reasons given it is not considered that this could be overcome through a restrictive condition.",
    "The proposal fails to provide adequate levels of off-street parking for the level of occupation proposed, resulting in increased pressure on on-street parking to the detriment of the safe and efficient operation of the highway and convenience of occupiers of neighbouring properties. In this respect, the proposal would be contrary to Policies 8 and 24 of the Local Plan 2021.",
    "The proposal fails to provide adequate room sizes for all the first floor bedrooms and two of the second floor bedrooms, resulting in substandard level of accommodation to the detriment of the living conditions of the future occupiers. In this respect, the proposal would be contrary to the East London HMO guidance.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, it was necessary to issue a decision as close to the statutory timeframe as possible as opposed to seeking amendments which would have significantly delayed the application."
