    "The proposed extension by reason of its design would unacceptably compromise the architectural composition/feature of the building. In particular the proposed two storey front extension in combination with the protruded car portico would dominate the existing two storey wing to both sides which forms the main feature in the front elevation of the host property contrary to Policies DC61 and DC69 of the London Borough of Havering LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD 2008 and the London Borough of Havering Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD and the Emerson Park Policy Area SPD",
    "The proposed extensions to this previously extended property gives rise to a form of development that, by reason of the extent of the alterations and the excessive cumulative bulk, scale and mass of the  extensions and their degree of visibility in the wider streetscene would significantly harm the character of the host building and be an intrusive and unneighbourly development thereby having an adverse effect on the visual amenities and character of the area, contrary to Policies DC61 and DC69 of the London Borough of Havering LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD 2008 and the London Borough of Havering Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD and the Emerson Park Policy Area SPD.",
