    "The proposed dwellings through the site layout and plot coverage would form an incongruous and visually cramped form of development at odds with surrounding character and patterns of development in an environment of more consistent plot sizes. The proposals would therefore be contrary to Policies 10, 7 and 26 of the Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 and also Paragraph 130(a) of the NPPF which requires fundamentally that development add to the overall quality of the area whilst also establishing or maintaining a strong sense of place.",
    "In the absence of a Arboricultural Survey and Preliminary Ecological Appraisal the proposal cannot be adequately assessed against Policy 26 of the Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 and the National Planning Policy Framework.",
    "The proposed access for waste collection from Willow Way is not suitable for an RCV given it is not an adopted highway and its condition is not suitable for an RCV due to poor surface and narrow access from Homeway, alongside a lack of parking restrictions. Therefore, the proposal cannot demonstrate that adequate provision for waste colelction can be provided against Policy 35 of the Havering Local Plan 2016-2035.",
