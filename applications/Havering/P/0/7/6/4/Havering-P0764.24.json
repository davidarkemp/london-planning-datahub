    "The proposed roof alterations would create a visual bulk at a high level and reduce the space between the dwellings at roof level in a manner which be inconsistent with local character and detrimental to the street-scene. The shallow roof pitch of the existing dwellings as approved result in elongated rear dormers which would be highly visible. The design of the dormers and their number in conjunction would diminish the qualities of the scheme which had made it acceptable and would contribute to a cramped overdevelopment of the site. In this regard the proposals are contrary to the guidance set out in the Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD, and the polices Policies 7 and 26 set in Havering Local Plan 2016-2031, as well as the NPPF which requires fundamentally at Para 130 that development add to the overall quality of the area and maintain a strong sense of place.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to the agent in writing 29-07-2024",
    "The proposal, if granted planning permission on appeal, would be liable for the Mayor of London and Havering Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). Based upon the information supplied with the application, the Mayoral CIL payable would be £6,457.50 based on the calculation of £25.00 per square metre and the Havering Community Infrastructure Levy (HCIL) would be a charge of £32,287.50 based on calculation of £125 per square metre. Each would be subject to indexation.",
