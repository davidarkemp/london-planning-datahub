    "The proposed outbuilding, by reason of its configuration resulting in the subdivision of the plot and due to the scale and mass, would form an incongruous feature within the rear garden environment of Wykeham Avenue and street scene of Fanshawe Crescent, something which would be in contrast to other smaller domestic outbuildings typically found in the locality. As such, it would appear as uncharacteristic intrusion in the locality that would be contrary to the pattern of the development in the area, contrary to Local Plan Policies 7 and 26 and the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document.",
    "The proposed outbuilding would be likely to function as a self-contained residential unit in the rear garden scene would result in additional comings and goings associated with an independent use of a building, resulting in unacceptable impact upon the amenities of the adjoining neighbours, contrary to Policies 7 and 26 of the Havering Local Plan 2021 and the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document.",
