    "The original dwelling had a gross internal floor space of approximately 90.08 square metres, which fails to meet the standard of 120 square metres, thereby resulting in the unacceptable loss of a much needed larger family homes within the Borough, contrary to Policy 8(i) of the Havering Local Plan 2021.",
    "The development by reason of its housing typology, the sitting of the property and the nature of the use as a large HMO with high prospective occupancy and poor access to public transport, would result in significantly higher levels of comings / goings and intensive activity over and above that of a single dwelling house resulting in a detrimental impact to the amenity of adjoining residents from noise and disturbance associated. This would be exacerbated by vehicle ownership and use of the shared access and the proposals would therefore be contrary to Policies 8 and 34 of the Havering Local Plan 2016-2031. For the reasons given it is not considered that this could be overcome through a restrictive condition.",
