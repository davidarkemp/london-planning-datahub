    "The proposed development would, by reason of its site constraints and design approach including the site coverage and quantum of development, resulting in an overdevelopment, cramped layout, compromised outlook, loss of privacy to the front bedroom of Plot 2, shallow rear amenity spaces, and proximity of units with some habitable room windows to the boundaries of the site, give rise to an unsatisfactory relationship between the proposal and the site boundaries and leading to a substandard and poor quality of living accommodation environment, as well as a harmful relationship with the rear of 26 Albert Road, to the detriment of the amenity of both the existing and future occupiers and the character of the surrounding area contrary to Policies 7 and 26 of the Local Plan 2021.",
    "The proposal, by reason of its failure to provide a safe dedicated pedestrian and cyclist access to the site, coupled with the poor layout, would result in an overly cramped development to the detriment of highway safety and the residential amenity of the existing and future occupiers. The development would be contrary to Local Plan policy 7 and London Plan policies D5 and D6 and paragraph 110 of the NPPF (2021).",
    "The proposed development by reason of its scale and sitting would result in an overdominant, discordant and unduly prominent form of development that fails to respect the established pattern of development, to the detriment of the character and appearance of the site and surrounding area contrary to Policy 26 of the Local Plan 2021.",
    "The proposal, if granted planning permission on appeal, would be liable for both the Mayor of London Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and the Havering Council's Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) . Based upon the information supplied with the application, the CIL payable would be a total £46,350.00. Further details with regard to CIL are available from the Council's website.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, it was necessary to issue a decision as close to the statutory timeframe as possible as opposed to seeking amendments which would have significantly delayed the application."
