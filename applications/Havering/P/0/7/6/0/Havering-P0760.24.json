    "The unauthorised development by definition is inappropriate development in green belt and has a harmful impact on the character and appearance of the green belt by incorporating a significant area of the site for the display of cars thus introducing forms of development that is detrimental to the character and appearance of the green belt and reduce the openness. The proposed development, by reason of intensity of the use of the site through the excessive site coverage by car parking, devoid of any soft landscaping conflicts with the fundamental aim of Green Belt Policy and conflicts with the Framework, London Plan Policy G2, Policies 26 and 27 of the Local Plan",
    "The proposal, if granted planning permission on appeal, would be liable for the Havering Community infrastructure Levy (HCIL) and Mayoral Community Infrastructure Levy (MCIL). Based upon the information supplied with the application, the Levy would be £3171.25  payable are (subject to indexation). Further details with regard to CIL are available from the councils website.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to the agent of the applicant.",
    "You are inform that currently there is no planning permission for the site. The temporary planning permission granted has now expired and the current operation on site together with the structures on site are thus unauthorised. In addition there are and have been significant breaches of planning condition with respect to the previously approved scheme, in particular with respect to soft landscaping, boundary treatment, the number of cars for sales. The erection of the new steel structure is also unauthorised. Finally, the issue of the drainage has not been resolved."
