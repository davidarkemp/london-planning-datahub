    "The proposed building would, by reason of its scale, bulk and proximity to the neighbouring property be an intrusive, overbearing and unneighbourly development that would have an adverse effect on the amenities of the adjacent occupiers at no.1 Queens Park Road resulting in a loss of outlook and an increased sense of enclosure with an overbearing impact contrary to Policy 7 of the Havering Local Plan and the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document.",
    "The proposal would result in a dominant and visually intrusive feature within the street scene resulting in a cramped form of development contrary to Policies 7 and 26 of the Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 and NPPF which requires fundamentally that development add to the overall quality of the area whilst also establishing or maintaining a strong sense of place.",
    "The proposal has the potential for loss of on-street parking on Queens Road. The proposed parking layout would involve removing a restricted parking bay in front of the planned extended dropped kerb, which currently accommodates 3 to 1 cars. No information has been provided demonstrating parking capacity survey on Queens Park Road to assess whether the existing and proposed parking arrangement meets the parking demands during peak times. As such, the proposal would likely result in increase in parking on the neighbouring highway(s) would be detrimental to the free flow and safety of traffic on the neighbouring highway(s) and the amenity of neighbouring residents, contrary to Policy 24 of the Local Plan and T6 of the London Plan.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, it was necessary to issue a decision as close to the statutory timeframe as possible as opposed to seeking amendments which would have significantly delayed the application.",
    "The proposal, if granted planning permission on appeal, would be liable for the Mayor of London and Havering Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). Based upon the information supplied with the application, the Mayoral CIL payable would be £2275 based on £25.00 per square metre and the Havering Community Infrastructure Levy (HCIL) would be a charge of £11,375 based on calculation of £125 per square metre. Each would be subject to indexation.",
    "Further details with regard to CIL are available from the Council's website."
