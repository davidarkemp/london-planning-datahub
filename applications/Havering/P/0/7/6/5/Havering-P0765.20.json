    "The proposed two storey front extension, by reason of its excessive depth, scale, bulk, mass and gabled roof design  would appear as an unduly obtrusive and prominent feature in the street scene disrupting the relatively harmonious appearance of the terraced group and causing harm to its character. The development is therefore contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document, the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document and Policy 7.4 of the London Plan.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to Mr Mulry by e-mail on 30/07/20."
