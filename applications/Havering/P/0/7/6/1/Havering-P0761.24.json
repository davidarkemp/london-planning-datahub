    "The proposed extension to the existing vehicular crossover and driveway to the front of units 1 and 2 would by reason of its layout would result in unsatisfactory parking arrangement for the future occupiers of the site and by reason of its proximity close to the nearby junction, would likely to result in road safety hazards and the free flow of the traffic detrimental to the safety of pedestrians and other road users, contrary to London Plan Policies T4 and T6, the Havering Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD and Domestic Vehicle Dropped Kerb Policy April 2023.",
    "The proposal to alter the approved forecourt of the semi-detached property on site would adversely impact on the appearance, character and nature of site and surrounding area, and would further impact on the amenity of occupiers at unit 1 of the approved scheme, contrary to the aims and objectives of Policies 7, 26 and 27 of the Local Plan 2021.",
