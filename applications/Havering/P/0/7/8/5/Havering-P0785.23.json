    "Reason: To comply with the requirements of Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended by Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004).",
    "No above ground works shall take place in relation to any of the development hereby approved until details of all materials to be used in the external construction of the building including details of the privacy screening to serve the patio area are submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority and thereafter the development shall be constructed with the approved materials.",
    "Reason: To ensure that the appearance of the proposed development will harmonise with the character of the surrounding area.",
    "The development hereby permitted shall not be carried out otherwise than in complete accordance with the approved plans (as set out on page one of this decision notice).",
    "Reason: For the avoidance of doubt and to ensure that the development is carried out as approved.",
    "Any planting, seeding or turfing as indicated on submitted plans shall be carried out in the first planting season following completion of the development unless otherwise agreed in writing by the local Planning Authority. Any hard landscaping to be replaced shall be permeable unless otherwise agreed in writing with the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason: To ensure that the development achieves a satisfactory level of landscape quality.",
    "All hard-surfaces comprising this development (including any sub-base) shall be made of porous materials or provision shall be made to direct run-off water from the hard surface to a permeable or porous area or surface within the curtilage of the dwellinghouse.",
    "Reason:-",
    "In order to ensure no water run-off from the hard surface which would contribute to risk of flooding",
    "Notwithstanding the provisions of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 in accordance with the Order, no extension or enlargement (excluding additions to roofs) shall be made to the dwellinghouse hereby permitted without the express permission in writing of the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:-",
    "In the interests of amenity and to enable the Local Planning Authority to retain control over future development.",
    "Should the ASHP shown on drawing no.  2023-238-P-501 Rev B not be implemented then prior to the first occupation of the development, details shall be submitted to and agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority for the installation of Ultra-Low NOx boilers with maximum NOx Emissions less than 40 mg/kWh. Where any installations do not meet this emissions standard it should not be operated without the fitting of suitable NOx abatement equipment or technology as determined by a specialist to ensure comparable emissions. The installation of the boilers shall be carried out in strict accordance with the agreed details and shall thereafter be permanently retained.",
    "Reason: To minimise the impact of building emissions on local air quality.",
    "Water efficiency - All dwellings hereby approved shall comply with Regulation 36 (2)(b) and Part G2 of the Building Regulations - Water Efficiency.",
    "Reason: In order to comply with Policy SI 5 of the London Plan..",

The applicant shall otherwise submit for the approval of the Local Planning Authority a full scheme of boundary treatment for consideration. Boundary treatment compliant with the provisions of the GPDO, or a scheme otherwise agreed by the LPA shall be installed prior to first occupation of the dwelling hereby approved.",

    "Notwithstanding the details shown on submitted plans the installation of any Air Source Heat Pump as is shown indicatively on drawing no. 2023-238-P-501 Rev B shall be designed to comply with  \"MCS Planning Standards for Permitted Development Installations of Wind Turbines and Air Source Heat Pumps on Domestic Premises\". The applicant shall otherwise submit for the approval of the Local Planning Authority full details of any ASHP for consideration.",
    "Reason: In the interests of sustainability and amenity.",
    "Prior to first occupation of the dwelling privacy screens of the proportions shown on drawing nos. 2023-238-P-521, 2023-238-P-501 Rev B shall be installed to the satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority in accordance with details to be previously submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority.
