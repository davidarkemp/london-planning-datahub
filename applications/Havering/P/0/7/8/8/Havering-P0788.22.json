    "The proposed dwelling through its design, mass and site layout would form an isolated, incongruous and visually cramped form of development at odds with surrounding character in an environment more familiar with subordinate outbuildings. The proposals would therefore be contrary to Policies 10, 7 and 26 of the Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 and also Paragraph 130(a) of the NPPF which requires fundamentally that development add to the overall quality of the area whilst also establishing or maintaining a strong sense of place.",
    "The proposed dwelling would form a visually intrusive and overbearing feature from adjacent rear gardens detrimental to neighbouring amenity and therefore contrary to Policies 10, 7 and 26 of the Havering Local Plan 2016-2031. There would also be conflict with paragraph 130 of the National Planning Policy Framework which seeks to ensure a high standard of amenity for existing and future occupiers.",
    "The proposals would result in the loss of off-street parking for the donor dwelling. The applicant has not evidenced satisfactorily that any adverse impacts associated with this deficit could be mitigated and the development would accordingly be contrary to Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 Policies 10 and 24 and also London Plan Policy T6.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to the agent in writing 22-07-2022.",
