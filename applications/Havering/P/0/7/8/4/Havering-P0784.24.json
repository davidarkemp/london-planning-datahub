    "To comply with the requirements of Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended by Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004).",
    "The development hereby permitted shall not be carried out otherwise than in complete accordance with the approved plans (as set out on page one of this decision notice).",
    "Reason:-",

    "Furthermore, during construction of the development, the trees located within Upminster Park shall not be lopped or felled without the written consent of the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Any trees which become seriously damaged, diseased or die during the course of the development shall be replaced in the next planting season with others of a similar size and species unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority.",

    "Notwithstanding the provisions of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015, no window or other opening (other than those shown on the submitted and approved plans) shall be formed in the flank walls of the building hereby permitted, unless specific permission under the provisions of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 has first been sought and obtained in writing from the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:-",
    "In order to ensure a satisfactory development that will not result in any loss of privacy or damage to the environment of neighbouring properties which exist or may be proposed in the future.",

    "(a) a Biodiversity Gain Plan should be submitted to the planning authority, and",
    "(b) the planning authority has approved the plan.",
    "The planning authority, for the purposes of determining whether to approve a Biodiversity Gain Plan if one is required in respect of this permission would be Havering Borough Council.",
    "There are statutory exemptions and transitional arrangements which mean that the biodiversity gain condition does not always apply. These are listed in paragraph 17 of Schedule 7A of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 and the Biodiversity Gain Requirements (Exemptions) Regulations 2024.",
    "Based on the information available this permission is considered to be one which will require the approval of",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: In accordance with paragraph 38 of the National Planning Policy Framework, improvements required to make the proposal acceptable were negotiated with the planning agent via email. The revisions involved design, bulk, scale and massing of the proposed developments. The amendments were subsequently submitted on 05/02/2025."
