    "The proposal gives rise to undersized and poor standard of accommodation, to the detriment of the living conditions of future occupiers, in particular by reason of the insufficient gross internal floor area and the lack of amenity space afforded to the second floor flats. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy 3.5 of The London Plan, Policies DC4 and DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD.",
    "The proposed development would, by reason of its height, bulk and mass, appear as an unacceptably dominant and visually intrusive feature in the streetscene harmful to the appearance of the surrounding area contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD.",
    "The proposed rear parking area would result in an increase of noise and disturbance causing harm to neighbouring residential amenity and adversely effecting the living conditions of adjacent occupiers, contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD.",
    "The proposed rear amenity space, by reason of its position and proximity to windows to habitable rooms of proposed Flat 1  would cause overlooking and loss of privacy which would have a serious and adverse effect on the living conditions of occupiers of this flat, contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reasons for it was given to the agent and applicant via email on 15/07/2019.",
    "The proposal, if granted planning permission on appeal, would be liable for the Mayor of London Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). Based upon the information supplied with the application, the CIL payable would be £3675.. Further details with regard to CIL are available from the Council's website.",
    "Additionally, approval of this application from 1st September 2019 (either by Havering Council, or subsequently by PINS if allowed on appeal following a refusal by Havering Council) will attract a liability payment of £18,375 plus indexation in Havering Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL)."
