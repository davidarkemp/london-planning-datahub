    "The proposed extension, by reason of its bulk and design, including lack of first floor setback, roof height and fenestration design, would form a visually intrusive and overly dominant form of development which would be detrimental to the character of host property and the wider terrace, detrimental to the wider street-scene and therefore contrary to Havering Local Plan Policies 7 and 26 and the design guidance within the Council's Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD. There would be conflict also with the NPPF which at Para 130(a) which requires development add to the overall quality of the area.",
    "The proposed extension, by reason of its scale, bulk, mass, height and proximity to shared boundary of the adjoining site where a permission has been implemented for a new dwelling, would form an intrusive and overbearing feature which would be detrimental to the outlook and result in an increased sense of enclosure to the future occupiers of the dwelling. The development is therefore be contrary to Havering Local Plan Policies 7 and 26 and the design guidance within the Council's Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document.",
