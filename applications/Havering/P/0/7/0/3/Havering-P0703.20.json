  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed development would not demonstrate a suitably high quality living environment for future occupiers, with the accommodation in the loft area providing a poor quality residential environment due to the low ceiling levels and lack of useable space; as well as the lack of provision of usable private amenity space, and poor quality pedestrian access to the site.  This would be to the detriment of the amenity of future occupiers giving rise to a poor quality living environment contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD, the Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD, the Residential Design SPD and Policy 3.5 of the London Plan.",
    "The proposed development would, by reason of its height, bulk and mass, appear as an unacceptably dominant and visually intrusive feature in the streetscene. The gable end roof form would be at odds with the surrounding pattern of development and given the bulk and mass of the development at roof level and its prominent siting and location within the Parsonage Road streetscene would be harmful to the character and appearance of the surrounding area contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD and Policy 7.4 of the London Plan.",
    "The proposed development would, by way of the location of the external staircase and limited separation from shared boundaries represent a dominant and oppressive feature which would give rise to harm to the privacy and amenity of occupiers of the adjacent residential property contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to the agent in writing 8 September 2020.",
    "Please note also that should permission be granted, from 1st September 2019 (either by London Borough of Havering, or subsequently by PINS if allowed on appeal following a refusal by London Borough of Havering) will attract a liability payment of £14,100 plus indexation in Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This charge has been levied under s.206 of the Planning Act 2008 and includes both the Mayor of London's CIL and Havering Council's CIL.",
    "London Borough of Havering, as CIL collecting authority, has responsibility for the collection of the Mayoral CIL, in addition to Havering's CIL, on commencement of the development. Based upon calculations undertaken by the case officer and information supplied with the application your proposal is subject to a CIL Liability Notice indicating a levy of £2,350 plus indexation for the application, based on the Mayoral CIL levy rate for Havering of £25/sq.m plus Havering's charging rate for residential of £125/sq.m (Zone A) and the floorspace of 9"
