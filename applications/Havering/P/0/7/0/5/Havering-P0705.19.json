  "description": "PROPOSED NEW 2 BED DWELLING",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed development would by reason of its design and the width of the dwelling plot, and the inadequate internal size of the unit, give rise to an unacceptably cramped development being visually obtrusive, incongruous and harmful to the character and appearance of the street scene, contrary to the aims and objectives of Policy DC61 of the Development Control Policies Development Plan Document.",
    "The proposed development would, by reason of its position and proximity to neighbouring properties cause a loss of outlook which would have a serious and adverse effect on the living conditions of the adjacent occupier at No.9 Harcourt Mews, contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to Mr Perkins (Agent) by phone on 29/08/19.",
    "For Residential Development Only",
    "Please be advised that approval of this application from 1st September 2019 (either by London Borough of Havering, or subsequently by PINS if allowed on appeal following a refusal by London Borough of Havering) will attract a liability payment of £8,400 plus indexation in Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This charge has been levied under s.206 of the Planning Act 2008 and includes both the Mayor of London's CIL and Havering Council's CIL.",
    "London Borough of Havering, as CIL collecting authority, has responsibility for the collection of the Mayoral CIL, in addition to Havering's CIL, on commencement of the development.",
    "Your proposal is subject to a CIL Liability Notice indicating a levy of £1,400 plus indexation for the application, based on the Mayoral CIL levy rate for Havering of £25/sq.m plus Havering's charging rate for residential of £125/sq.m (Zone A) and the floorspace of 56 square metres.",
