    "The proposed rear extension, by reason of its excessive depth and position close to the boundaries of the site, would form a dominant and intrusive feature which would have an overbearing impact, resulting in a significant loss of outlook and an increased sense of enclosure to the detriment of the amenity of the occupiers of No.65 Philip Road. In addition, the cumulative depth of extensions would not be subordinate to the host building and would appear to unbalance the pair of semis when viewed from the context of the rear garden area, contrary to the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document, policies D1, D3 and D4 of The London Plan (2021) and Policy 7 of the Local Plan.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, it was necessary to issue a decision as close to the statutory timeframe as possible as opposed to seeking amendments which would have significantly delayed the application."
