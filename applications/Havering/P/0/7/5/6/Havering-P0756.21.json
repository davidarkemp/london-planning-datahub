    "The proposed development would, by reason of its uncharacteristically narrow configuration and plot-width as well as cramped appearance, be out of keeping with the pattern of development in the local area and harmfully inconsistent with the prevailing character of the local area, contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Design Guide. The proposal would also fail to accord with the core principle set out in Paragraph 127 of the National Planning Policy Framework which seeks to ensure a high standard of amenity for existing and future occupants of land and buildings.",
    "The proposed development would result in living conditions that do not create a suitably high quality living environment for future occupiers. The proposal would be substandard for a three person dwelling, with the overall dimension failing to meet the internal space standards of the nationally described space standards. The lack of internal space, narrow and cramped configuration would be in direct contrast to the aims of London Plan Policy D6, the nationally described space standard and Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD.",
    "The proposed development would provide inadequate on-site car parking provision. The submitted drawings indicates a car being positioned at an angle which would restrict manoeuvring when entering and existing the site, in particular if there is another car (belonging to a separate occupier) is parked on the hardstanding. Further, the proposal by providing significant amount of hardstanding together to the front garden would be inconsistent with the pattern of development in the local area contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD",
