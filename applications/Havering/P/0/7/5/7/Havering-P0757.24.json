    "The proposed hip to gable roof extension and the rear dormer by reason of its height, bulk and mass would not appear suitably subservient to the scale of the existing dwelling and it would appear as a dominant and bulky feature in the immediate area. Furthermore, the hip to gable extension, would unbalance the pair of semi-detached houses and be out of character with the prevailing pattern of development in this cul-de-sac, appearing as an unacceptably dominant and visually intrusive development harmful to the appearance of the both the host dwelling, the pair of semi-detached houses and the surrounding area contrary to Policies 7 and 26 of the Havering Local Plan and the Council's Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document.",
