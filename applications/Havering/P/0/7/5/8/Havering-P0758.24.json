    "The proposal to convert the existing dwellinghouse with an original floorspace of less than 120sqm would be unacceptable in principle as it would result in the loss of a family sized dwelling and fail to re-provide a family sized home of where there is a recognised shortage of family accommodation in the Borough. As such, the proposal would result in the loss of a family sized home and would undermine the objective of ensuring mixed and balanced communities to meet current and future housing needs contrary to Local Plan Policies 5 and 9.",
    "The ground floor 2B4P flat would fall below the minimum internal floor space of 70sqm required to comply with the standards set out in Table 3.1 of the London Plan and the first floor 2B4P flat would fail to have floor-to-ceiling heights that would be 2.50m for at least 75% of its gross internal area, thereby meaning the flats would fail to provide an acceptable standard of accommodation for future occupiers contrary to Local Plan Policy 7 and London Plan Policy D6.",
    "The proposal would result in a first floor living room adjoining an upper floor bedroom within the adjoining dwelling of no. 46 Cecil Avenue detrimental to the residential amenity of this property contrary to Local Plan policy 9 and London Plan policy D13.",
