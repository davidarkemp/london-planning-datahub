  "site_name": "5 Oaklands Avenue",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed development would, by reason of its combined height, bulk, mass, design and proximity to the common boundary with no.7 Oakland Avenue, appear as an unacceptably dominant and overbearing development to the detriment of both adjoining neighbours and be a visually intrusive feature in the street scene and garden scene harmful to the appearance of the surrounding area and character, which is contrary to the Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD 2011 and Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD.",
    "The proposal, if granted planning permission on appeal, would be liable for the Mayor of London Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and Havering CIL. The proposal includes the creation of an additional 260 square metres of additional gross internal area (GIA) of residential space. Mayoral CIL is charged at £25 per square metre resulting in £6,500. Havering CIL is charged at £125 per square metre (for Residential development in Zone A - North), resulting in £32,500.",
    "Based upon the information supplied with the application, the total CIL payable would be £39,000. Further details with regard to CIL are available from the Council's website at the following link.",

    "It is noted that no CIL form or exemption has been submitted with this application.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to Mr Carl Biagioni, via email on 28 July 2020."
