Written records of the vehicle loads and tonnages removed from and imported to the site shall be kept for the duration of the operations on site and made available to the Mineral Planning Authority on request within seven working days.",
    "Reason:",
    "The development has been assessed on the basis that a given amount of material will be transported to and from the site per annum.",
    "In relation to this site and the wider site granted planning permission under ref P0271.14, heavy goods vehicle movements into the approved mineral extraction and infilling areas (land adjoining East Hall Lane), shall not exceed 96 movements in and 96 movements out per day in relation to the New Road site access, for the duration of the development, unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Mineral Planning Authority. Written records detailing the daily vehicle movements to and from the site over the duration of the development, including the tonnages of material imported and exported, shall be retained at the site at all times, and shall be made available for inspection by the Mineral Planning Authority. A copy of the aforementioned record shall also be provided to the Mineral Planning Authority on request within seven working days of request.",
    "Reason:",
    "The development has been assessed on the basis that a given amount of material will be transported to and from the site per annum.",
    "With the exception of the topsoil, subsoil, and overburden bunds and storage indicated on the approved plans, no material, either extracted from the site or imported for infilling, shall be stored beyond the extraction void(s), and within the voids shall not exceed the heights of the nearest void walls.",
    "Reason:",
    "In the interests of visual amenity",
    "The whole of the application site, shall be fully restored, in accordance with the approved restoration scheme, within 3 years of the commencement of development.",
    "Reason:",
    "In the interests of ensuring the site is restored as soon as possible.",
    "No infiltration of surface water drainage into the ground is permitted other than with the express written consent of the Mineral Planning Authority, which may be given for those parts of the site where it has been demonstrated that there is no resultant unacceptable risk to controlled waters. The development shall be carried out in accordance with the approval details.",
    "Reason:",
    "To ensure no detrimental impact on ground or surface water quality and the Inner Thames SSI. There may be a risk of reduction in groundwater treatment by discharging the dewatered groundwater to soakaway downgradient and it is important that this considered prior to the discharge location being finalised. To ensure compliance with the Water Framework Directive.",
    "As part of the restoration process all soils and overburden shall be placed to the same original average depths that they were stripped at.",
    "Reason:",
    "To ensure that the proposed activity will not increase flood risk off site and to third parties. To ensure that the material used to backfill the site will not result in a reduction in permeability and resultant increase in surface water run-off from the site when compared to the pre-developed site.",
    "Following commencement and during of on-site operations, measurements of noise from on-site operations must be taken and a report demonstrating that the site operations meets the design predictions of the submitted Environmental Statement report dated February 2014 and the results shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:",
    "To minimise the impact of the development on the surrounding area in the interests of amenity.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: In accordance with paragraph 38 of the National Planning Policy Framework, improvements required to make the proposal acceptable were negotiated with the agent of the applicant. The revisions involved, the alteration to the position of the bound and additional archaeological study.  The amendments were subsequently submitted during the process of the application.",
    "Throughout the period of working, restoration and aftercare, the operator should take all reasonable steps to ensure that the approved operations do not result in any damage to the highway, or result in any impairment of highway safety.",
    "You are informed that, \"The Environmental Permitting (England and Wales) Regulations 2016 require a permit to be obtained for any activities which will take place:",
    "Â· on or within 8 metres of a main river (16 metres if tidal)",
    "Â· on or within 8 metres of a flood defence structure or culvert (16 metres if tidal)",
    "Â·on or within 16 metres of a sea defence",
    "Â·involving quarrying or excavation within 16 metres of any main river, flood defence (including a remote defence) or culvert",
    "Â·in a floodplain more than 8 metres from the riverbank, culvert or flood defence structure (16 metres if it's a tidal main river) and you don't already have planning permission.\"",
    "Planning approval does not constitute approval for changes to the public highway. Highway Authority approval will only be given after suitable details have been submitted considered and agreed. If new or amended access as required (whether temporary or permanent), there may be a requirement for the diversion or protection of third party utility plant and it is recommended that early involvement with the relevant statutory undertaker takes place. The applicant must contact Engineering Services on 01708 433751 to discuss the scheme and commence the relevant highway approvals process. Please note that unauthorised work on the highway is an offence.",
    "The access works will be subject to an agreement made under S278 of the Highways Act 1980 (as amended) and will cover the installation and final removal of the accesses. It is likely that part of the agreement will have a requirement for the ongoing maintenance of the section of East Hall Lane being used to cross between sites.",
    "The developer (including their representatives and contractors) is advised that planning consent does not discharge the requirements of the New Roads and Street Works Act 1991 and the Traffic Management Act 2004. Formal notifications and approval will be needed for any highway works (including temporary works of any nature) required during the construction of the development. Please note that unauthorised work on the highway is an offence.",
    "The developer is advised that if construction materials are proposed to be kept on the highway during construction works then they will need to apply for a license from the Council. If the developer requires scaffolding, hoarding or mobile cranes to be used on the highway, a licence is required and Streetcare should be contacted on 01708 434343 to make the necessary arrangements. Please note that unauthorised use of the highway for construction works is an offence.",
    "The development of this site is likely to damage heritage assets of archaeological and historical interest. The applicant should therefore submit detailed proposals in the form of an archaeological project design. The design should be in accordance with the appropriate English Heritage guidelines.",
    "The applicant is reminded that the proposed location of the refuse and recycling storage may be contrary to the Building Regulations requirements. It is recommended that this matter be discussed with the Council's Building Control officers prior to the commencement of development.",
    "Throughout the period of working, restoration and aftercare, the operator should take all reasonable steps to ensure that drainage from areas adjoining the site is not impaired or rendered less efficient by the permitted operations. The operator shall take all reasonable steps, including the provision of any necessary works, to prevent damage by erosion, silting or flooding and to make proper provision for the disposal of all water entering, arising on or leaving the site during the permitted operations.",
    "Any oil, fuel, lubricant, paint or solvent within the site should be stored so as to prevent such material from contaminating topsoil, subsoil, soil forming material, or reaching any watercourse.",
    "Throughout the period of working, restoration and aftercare, the operator should have due regard to the need to adhere to the precautions laid out in the leaflet entitled \"Preventing the Spread of Plant and Animal Diseases\", published by Defra."
