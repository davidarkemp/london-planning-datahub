    "The proposed ground floor side/rear and first floor rear extensions, by reason of their excessive bulk, scale, massing and widths, would result in extensions to the main dwelling that would appear as unacceptably dominant and visually intrusive within the street and rear garden scenes and therefore would be harmful to the character, appearance and visual amenity of the host property and surrounding area, contrary to Local Plan Policies 7 and 26 as well as the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document.",
    "The proposed rear dormer window, by reason of its excessive bulk, scale, massing and width, would appear as a dominant and visually intrusive feature within the rear roof slope of the host property that would be detrimental to the character and appearance of the subject dwelling and the visual amenity of the rear garden environment, contrary to Local Plan Policies 7 and 26 and the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reasons for it was given to the agent by e-mail on 28/07/2025.",
    "Were the decision of this application to be subject of an appeal, the Inspector should note that the existing and proposed site plans shown on the drawing FV-2025-03 do not accurately depict the layout of the attached neighbouring property no. 53 Broadstone Road."
