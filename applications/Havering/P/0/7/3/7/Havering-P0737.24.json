    "The site is within the area identified in the Local Plan as Metropolitan Green Belt. The Local Plan, as well as the London Plan and the Guidance Given in the National Planning Policy Framework emphasise that in order to achieve the purposes of the Metropolitan Green Belt it is essential to retain and protect the openness of Green Belt, and that only limited new development will permitted for development, unless there is especial circumstance which would outweigh the harm it would cause. The proposal on its own and in particular in combination with that already already approved under application no. Y0232.19, would result in disproportionate addition to the existing modest scale building and would constitute   inappropriate development of the site which would cause undue harm to the openness of the Green Belt. Further, there is no cogent case to established very special circumstances which would outweigh the harm of the inappropriate development. Therefore, the proposal would be inappro",
