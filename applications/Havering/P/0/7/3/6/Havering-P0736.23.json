    "The proposal to increase the activities in the early hours of the day of this unit, would be likely to result in an unacceptable degree of noise and disturbance to the detriment of the amenity of nearby residents at a time of the day when the residents would reasonably expect a degree of peace and quiet. As such the proposals would be contrary to Policies 7 and 34 of the Havering Local Plan.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: The notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to the agent of the applicant on 4th August 2023. It should however be noted that the council provided additional opportunity for the applicant to provide responses to the council's concern with respect to adverse impact of noise upon the amenities of the adjoining occupiers. The noise consultant appointed by the applicant confirmed that noise activities by customers visiting the site could potentially occur but suggested that such activities should be controlled under environmental legislation. The council is on the assumption that the effective control in safeguarding the amenities of the adjoining occupier is through  restriction in hours of operation."
