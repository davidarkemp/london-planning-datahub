    "The proposed extension, in particular the single storey rear extension, by reason of its excessive depth be an intrusive and unneighbourly development which would appear as an unacceptably dominant and overbearing development to the detriment of adjoining neighbours at No. 49 Hainault Road and be a visually intrusive feature garden scene harmful to the appearance of the surrounding area and character, which is contrary to the Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD 2011 and Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, it was necessary to issue a decision as close to the statutory timeframe as possible as opposed to seeking amendments which would have significantly delayed the application."
