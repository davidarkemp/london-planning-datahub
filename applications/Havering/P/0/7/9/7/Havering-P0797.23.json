    "The proposed development would, by reason of its site constraints, location, sitting, the shallow and inadequate provision of external amenity space, limited outlook, sense of enclosure and relationship to adjoining properties would materially harm the living conditions of future occupiers, which would be contrary to Policy 7 of the Local Plan 2021. The proposal would also fail to accord with the core principle set out in Section 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework which seeks to ensure a high standard of amenity for existing and future occupants of land and buildings.",
    "The application fails to demonstrate that the proposal, having regard to the side access road with the presence of highway tree in close proximity, is able to make adequate provision for the servicing of the site, including adequate provision for refuse collection and access arrangements for emergency and rescue vehicles,  resulting in inadequate servicing arrangements contrary to Polices 24 and 35 of the Local Plan 2021.",
    "The proposed parking arrangements, with the loss of parking provision (the existing garage) to no. 177, Mawney Road, and the unsatisfactory parking arrangement would adversely impact on the living condition of prospective occupiers of the proposed development at dwelling no. 2 and result in an unacceptable overspill onto the adjoining roads to the detriment of highway safety and residential amenity contrary to Policy 24 of the Havering Local Plan and Policies T6 and T6.1 of the London Plan and paragraph 111 of the National Planning Policy Framework.",
    "In the absence of a full Tree Survey, the proposed development would result in the removal and/or harm to trees on/adjacent site, which would be materially harmful to the character and amenity of site and surrounding area, contrary to Policies 27 and 26 of the Local Plan 2021 and the Protection of Trees during Development Supplementary Planning Document.",
    "The proposal, if granted planning permission on appeal, would be liable for the Mayor of London Community Infrastructure Levy and Havering CIL. Based upon the information supplied with the application, the CIL payable would be £20,850. Further details with regard to CIL are available from the Council's website.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, it was necessary to issue a decision as close to the statutory timeframe as possible as opposed to seeking amendments which would have significantly delayed the application."
