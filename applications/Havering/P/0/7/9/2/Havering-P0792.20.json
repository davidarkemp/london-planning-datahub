    "The proposed removal of hedging between no. 64 Crossways and the adjacent public right of way and the extended area of hard surfacing by reason of its overall expanse, combined with the loss of soft landscaping, would set an undesirable precedent, detrimental to the open and verdant character of the Gidea Park Conservation Area. The proposal would neither preserve nor enhance the character and appearance of the host property and the wider Gidea Park Conservation Area setting, contrary to the NPPF 2019, London Plan policies 7.4 and 7.8 and policies DC61 & DC68 of the Local Development Framework Development Plan Document, and the Heritage Supplementary Planning Document.",
