    "The proposed development would by virtue of their poor design, scale and mass fail to integrate with the existing dwelling, compromise the architectural composition of the building and would appear incongruous and visually intrusive in the rear garden environment and front street scene and would further unbalance the pair of semi-detached property contrary to policies 7.4 and 7.6 of The London Plan (2016), policy DC61 of the London Borough of Havering LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD 2008, and the London Borough of Havering Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD 2011.",
    "The proposed development would, by reason of its position to neighbouring property will have direct views into neighbouring garden and give rise to overlooking and loss of privacy which would have a serious and adverse effect on the living conditions of adjacent occupiers at No. 58 Byron Way, contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD.",
