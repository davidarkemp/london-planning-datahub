    "The original dwelling has a gross internal floor space of 117 square metres, which fails to meet the standard of 120 square metres contrary to Policy 8 of the Havering Local Plan. The proposal would therefore have an adverse impact on the supply of family housing within the Borough, the loss of which is not adequately justified and which could set an undesirable precedent for similar development in the locality.",
    "The communal living/dining room of approximately 11sqm on the ground floor fails to meet the area of 16 square metres of communal space, which would provide a poor quality living environment harmful to the amenity of future occupiers contrary to Policy 8 of the Havering Local Plan and the HMO East London Guidance.",
    "The rear single bedroom on the first floor and the front single bedroom on the second floor both have a gross internal area of 6.8 square metres, which fail to meet the gross internal floor space of 8.5 square metres for one occupier and would be harmful to the amenity of future occupiers contrary to Policy 8 of the Havering Local Plan and the HMO East London Guidance.",
    "The proposal would result in an intensification of the site and result in significant harm to residential amenity from noise, disturbance and activity, contrary to Policies 7 and 8 of the Havering Local Plan.",
    "The proposed layout would result in inadequate and impractical access and egress arrangements for the tandem parking spaces for the five occupants of the proposed HMO and is likely to result in increased parking congestion in surrounding streets, contrary to Policies 8 and 24 of the Havering Local Plan, Policy T6.1 of the London Plan and the guidance contained in the National Planning Policy Framework.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to Parkers Design via email on 16th November 2023."
