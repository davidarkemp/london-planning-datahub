    "The proposed extension, by reason of its design, position and bulk would appear out of scale and character with the host dwelling, unbalance the pair of semis and materially harmful to the visual amenity of the surrounding area, contrary to Policy DC61 of the London Borough of Havering LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD 2008.",
    "The proposed two storey side/rear extension would, by reason of its excessive depth, height and position close to the boundaries of the site, be an intrusive and unneighbourly development as well as having an adverse effect on the amenities of adjacent occupiers contrary to Policy DC61 of the London Borough of Havering LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD 2008.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: In accordance with paragraph 38 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2018, improvements required to make the proposal acceptable were negotiated with the applicant in person in July 2019 and the agent (L'Autre Monde) via email in March 2020.  The revisions involved corrections to existing plans to reflect what is on site as well as amendments to the proposed development and application documents to align with planning requirements. The applicant failed to submit the suggested revisions."
