    "The development to which this permission relates must be commenced not later than three years from the date of this permission.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To comply with the requirements of Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended by Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004).",
    "Before the building(s) hereby permitted is first occupied, provision shall be made within the site for two car parking spaces and thereafter this provision shall be made permanently available for use, unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To ensure that adequate car parking provision is made off street in the interests of highway safety.",
    "All new external finishes shall be carried out in materials to match those of the existing building(s) to the satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To safeguard the appearance of the premises and the character of the immediate area, and in order that the development accords with the Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policy DC61.",
    "No dwelling hereby approved shall be occupied until there has been submitted to and approved by the Local Planning Authority a scheme of hard and soft landscaping, which shall include indications of all existing trees and shrubs on the site, and details of any to be retained, together with measures for the protection in the course of development. All planting, seeding or turfing comprised within the scheme shall be carried out in the first planting season following completion of the development and any trees or plants which within a period of 5 years from completion of the development die, are removed or become seriously damaged or diseased shall be replaced in the next planting season with others of a similar size and species, unless otherwise agreed in writing by the local Planning Authority. The implemented landscaping scheme shall be retained and maintained as such thereafter, unless an alternative scheme is submitted and approved by the local planning authority.",
    "Reason:-",
    "Insuff",
    "The proposals should provide a 2.1 by 2.1 metre pedestrian visibility splay on either side of the proposed access, set back to the boundary of the public footway.  There should be no obstruction or object higher than 0.6 metres within the visibility splay.",
    "Reason:-",
    "In the interests of highway safety, and in order that the development accords with the Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policy DC32.",
    "The development hereby permitted shall not be carried out otherwise than in complete accordance with the approved plans (as set out on page one of this decision notice).",
    "Reason:-",
    "For the avoidance of doubt and to ensure that the development is carried out as approved.",
    "The roof area of the extension hereby permitted shall not be used as a balcony, roof garden or similar amenity area without the grant of further specific permission from the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:-",
    "In the interests of the amenity of the occupiers of neighbouring dwelling, and in order that the development accords with the  Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policy DC61.",
    "No building shall be occupied or use commenced until refuse and recycling facilities are provided in accordance with details which shall previously have been submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority. The refuse and recycling facilities shall be permanently retained thereafter.",
    "Reason:-",
    "Insufficient information has been supplied with the application to judge how refuse and recycling will be managed on site.  Submission of this detail prior to occupation in the case of new building works or prior to the use commencing in the case of changes of use will protect the amenity of occupiers of the development and also the locality generally and ensure that the development accords with the Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policy DC61.",
    "No building shall be occupied or use commenced until the details of all proposed walls, fences and boundary treatment have been submitted to, and approved in writing by, the Local Planning Authority.  The boundary development shall then be carried out in accordance with the approved details prior to first occupation and retained permanently thereafter to the satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:",
    "Insufficient information has been supplied with the application to judge the appropriateness of any boundary treatment.  Submission of this detail prior to commencement will protect the visual amenities of the development, prevent undue overlooking of adjoining property and ensure that the development accords with the Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policy DC61.",
    "No building shall be occupied or use commenced until cycle storage is provided in accordance with details previously submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority. The cycle storage shall be permanently retained thereafter.",
    "Reason:-",
    "Insufficient information has been supplied with the application to demonstrate what facilities will be available for cycle parking.  Submission of this detail prior to occupation in the case of new building works or prior to the use commencing in the case of changes of use is in the interests of providing a wide range of facilities for non-motor car residents and sustainability.",
    "No works shall take place in relation to any of the development hereby approved until a scheme for protecting the proposed dwelling(s) from noise (air born and impact) from one another and for protecting the neighbouring attached dwelling from noise from the proposed dwellings is submitted to and approved by the Local Planning Authority. Any works which form part of the scheme shall be completed before any of the permitted dwelling(s) is occupied and retained permanently thereafter in accordance with the approved details.",
    "Reason:-",
    "Insufficient information has been supplied with the application to judge the appropriateness of the noise insulation measures to be employed. Submission of the information prior to commencement will prevent noise nuisance to the development from one another and neighbouring dwellings in accordance with Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policies DC55 and DC61.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015:improvements required to make the proposal acceptable were negotiated with the applicant's agent with respect to provision of amenity space, with the revision being submitted on the 15th June 2021.",
    "The proposal is liable for the Mayor of London Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). The Mayoral CIL levy rate for Havering is Ã?????????????????Â£25/mÃ?????????????????Â² and is chargeable for each additional square metre of residential gross internal [floor] (GIA).  Based upon the information supplied with the application, Ã?????????????????Â£450  would be payable due to result in a new residential property with 18mÃ?????????????????Â² of GIA, however this may be adjusted subject to indexation.",
    "The proposal is also liable for Havering Council's CIL. Havering's CIL charging rate for residential is Ã?????????????????Â£125mÃ?????????????????Â² (Zone A) [amend where Zone B] for each additional square metre of GIA. Based upon the information supplied with the application, Ã?????????????????Â£2250  would be payable, subject to indexation.",
    "These charges are levied under s.206 of the Planning Act 2008.  CIL is payable within 60 days of commencement of development. A Liability Notice will be sent",
    "This planning permission does not remove the need to obtain any separate consent of the owner of the adjoining property prior to commencing building works on, under, above or immediately adjacent to their property (e.g. foundations or guttering). The Party Wall Etc. Act 1996 contains requirements to serve notice on adjoining owners of property under certain circumstances, and a procedure exists for resolving disputes. This is a matter of civil law between the two parties, and the Local Planning Authority are not involved in such matters.",
