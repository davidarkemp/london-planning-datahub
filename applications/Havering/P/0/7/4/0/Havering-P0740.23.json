    "In the absence of any evidence otherwise the development would introduce uses which by their definition are more appropriate in residential settings rather than in a Strategic Industrial Location. Whilst there may be other benefits to the proposals, they are unlikely to outweigh the in principle harm to the SIL and there would consequently be conflict with Policy 9 of the Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 and London Plan Policies E4/E5 requires amongst other things that potential industrial activities in a SIL are not compromised or curtailed.",
    "The proposed change of use through limited information provided over the proposed use and limited site area fails to make adequate provision for parking associated. The proposed change of use is therefore contrary to Havering Local Plan Policies 23 and 24, as well as the London Plan T6. There would also be conflict with the NPPF which requires at Para 104(e) that parking and other transport considerations are integral to the design of schemes.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to the agent in writing 17-08-2023."
