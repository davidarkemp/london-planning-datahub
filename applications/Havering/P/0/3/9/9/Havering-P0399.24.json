    "The site is within the area identified in the Local Development Framework as Metropolitan Green Belt. The National Planning Policy Framework (Green Belts) states that in order to achieve the purposes of the Metropolitan Green Belt it is essential to retain and protect the openness of the so allocated and that new development will only be permitted outside the existing built up areas in the most exceptional circumstances. The proposal by reason introduction new housing with a significant physical presence  would amount to a substantial suburban incursion into the Green Belt. The residential nature of the proposals including its associated curtilages, would create a formalised domestic layout with gardens to the side and rear and a parking area. The proposals would introduce an urban layout and character which would significantly harm openness and would be materially harmful to the character and appearance of the Green Belt. The development is inappropriate in principle in the Green Belt",
    "The site is located in a Countryside Conservation Area and partly in a Site of Importance for Nature Conservation.  Policy 30 of the Local Plan states that developers should demonstrate that the impact of proposals on protected sites and species have been fully assessed when development has the potential to impact on such sites or species. Appropriate mitigation and compensation measures will also need to be identified where necessary. If significant harm resulting from a development cannot be avoided (through locating on an alternative site with less harmful impacts), adequately mitigated, or, as a last resort, compensated for, then planning permission will normally be refused.  Insufficient information has been provided to assess the impact on ecology and biodiversity on this site, in the absence of such information it is feared that the proposal would have a significant adverse impact upon the ecology and biodiversity of the site.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, it was necessary to issue a decision as close to the statutory timeframe as possible as opposed to seeking amendments which would have significantly delayed the application.",
    "The proposal, if granted planning permission on appeal, would be liable for the Mayor of London and Havering Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). Based upon the information supplied with the application, the Mayoral CIL payable would be £6500 based on the calculation of 25.00 per square metre and the Havering Community Infrastructure Levy (HCIL) would be  £32,500 based on calculation of £125 per square metre. Each would be subject to indexation.",
    "Further details with regard to CIL are available from the Council's website."
