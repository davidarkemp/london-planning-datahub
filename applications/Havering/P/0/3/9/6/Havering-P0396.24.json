    "The proposed rear extension would, by reason of its cumulative depth, height and positioning close to the boundary with the adjacent neighbour at No. 83 Briscoe Road, represent an intrusive and unneighbourly form of development. It would reduce the level of light and outlook into the rear of the neighbouring dwelling while contributing to an overbearing sense of enclosure, dominant and intrusive feature along the common boundary, and be unacceptable, contrary to Policy 7 of the Local Plan and the Council's Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD 2011.",
    "The proposed rear extension would, by reason of its excessive depth and cumulative footprint be out of scale and character with the pattern of rear garden development in the immediate surrounding area, harmful to the rear garden environment of neighbouring dwellings and, therefore, introduce an incongruous element to the setting of neighbouring dwellings, contrary to Policy 7 and 26 of the Local Plan and the Council's Residential and Extensions SPD 2011.",
