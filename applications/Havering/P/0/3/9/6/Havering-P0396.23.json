    "The development to which this permission relates must be commenced not later than three years from the date of this permission.",
    "Reason:-",

    "The development hereby permitted shall not be carried out otherwise than in complete accordance with the approved plans (as set out on page one of this decision notice).",
    "Reason:-",
    "For the avoidance of doubt and to ensure that the development is carried out as approved.",

    "Reason:-",
    "In the interests of the amenity of the occupiers of neighbouring dwelling.",
    "Prior to the commencement of any groundworks or development of the site, details shall be submitted to and agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority setting out suitable has protection measures to be employed on site including, but not necessarily limited to, the installation of a suitable has resistant membrane, in compliance with BS 8485:2015.
