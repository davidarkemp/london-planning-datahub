    "The Motor Trade Showroom use, in particular with respect to cramming of cars to the front of the premises, turning the front of the site into storage space for motor display as well as the harass fencing has significantly detracted from the character of the area, the scheme would appear visually intrusive, one which significantly detract from the character and appearance of the area, contrary to local policies 26 Urban design and 27 Landscaping, policy D1 of London Plan as well as policy advice within National Planning Policy Framework 2023, which all seek preservation and enhancement of the local environment, public realm and local character.",

In addition the manner in which the cars are parked onto this forecourts blocks the sightlines from the adjacent access road to the highway thereby further increasing the risk of hazards to the road users. It is considered that the proposal would be likely to result in hazards to pedestrian and vehicular users in this section of the road, thereby having adverse impact upon the highways safety and the free flow of traffic in this section of busy thoroughfare contrary to policy 23 Transport Connections of the Local Plan, Policy T6 of the London Plan and the advice given in National Planning Policy Framework 2023, which all seek preservation protect the safety of the highways condition and the free flow of traffic.",
    "The evidence from the site as well as the experiences expressed by the neighbouring occupiers clearly reveals that the proposal has given rise to substantial disturbances in particular with respect to the coming and going onto the narrow passageway adjacent to the site and the illegal and unauthorised parking, on parking spaces belonging to local residents. The proposal is therefore considered to have an adverse impact upon the quality of the life of the local residents contrary to policy 34 of the Local Plan, the policies in London Plan as well as the policy advice within NPPF 2023 which all seek to protect the quality of the life of local neighbourhood.",
