  "description": "Retrospective application for change of use from use class other storage yard to use class B8 storage.",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The site is within the area identified as Metropolitan Green Belt. The Local Development Framework and Government Guidance as set out in the NPPF is that in order to achieve the purposes of the Metropolitan Green Belt it is essential to retain and protect the existing rural character of the area so allocated and that the new building will only be permitted outside the existing built up areas in the most exceptional circumstances. The proposed development is an inappropriate form of development and by definition harmful to the open character of the Green Belt. No special circumstances have been submitted in this case and the proposal is therefore contrary to Policy DC45 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD and the provisions of the NPPF 2019.",
    "The development, comprising the change of use and various unauthorised structures has resulted in a visually intrusive form of development, which is detrimental to the open character of the Green Belt. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy DC45 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document, as well as the provisions of the National Planning Policy Framework 2019.",
    "No detail has been provided in plan form showing to what extent the yard areas would be used for storage, nor how vehicles would be accommodated within the site to park or visit in connection with the storage uses. The applicant has failed to set out clearly the implications for vehicle movement in an arrangement that is both high quality and promotes a safe arrangement for non-car mode users through intensification of any shared spaces. The red-line plan also fails to include the entirety of the site to the extent that parking, waste and servicing arrangements could not be secured. The proposals are contrary to Policies DC32, DC33, DC36 and DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal was given to the applicant's agent on 08-06-2020."
