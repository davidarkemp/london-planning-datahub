    "The proposal, by reason of the cramped internal layout, the relationship between the ground floor bedrooms and the kitchen/ communal areas, and the intensification of the existing residential use, would fail to create a high quality living environment for future occupiers and would instead represent a limited and poor quality standard of accommodation. As a result, the proposal would not provide acceptable living conditions for all of the future occupants, to the detriment of residential amenity and contrary to Policies DC4 and  DC61 of the London Borough of Havering LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD 2008.",
    "The proposed change of use, by reason of the increased amounts of activity within the building and outdoor areas, together with an intensification of the existing residential use would result in unacceptable levels of noise and disturbance to the detriment of residential amenity of neighbouring occupiers, and results in a distinct change in the character of the locality, which is typically defined by single family dwelling houses.The proposals are therefore contrary to Policies DC4 and  DC61 of the London Borough of Havering LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD 2008.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to the agent in writing 30-04-2019."
