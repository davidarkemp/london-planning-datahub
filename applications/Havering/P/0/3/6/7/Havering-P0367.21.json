  "decision_conditions": [
    "The development to which this permission relates must be commenced not later than three years from the date of this permission.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To comply with the requirements of Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended by Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004).",
    "The development hereby permitted shall not be carried out otherwise than in complete accordance with the approved plans (as set out on page one of this decision notice).",
    "Reason:",
    "For the avoidance of doubt and to ensure that the development is carried out as approved.",
    "Prior to commencement of the approved development, details and samples of the materials to be used in the exterior of the building shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the Local planning Authority. The development shall then be carried out in accordance with the approved specified materials.",
    "Reason:",
    "Submission of samples prior to commencement will ensure that the appearance of the proposed development will harmonise with the character of the surrounding area and comply with Policy DC61 of the Development Control Policies Development Plan Document.",
    "Notwithstanding the provisions of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015, the office, gym, and studio hereby permitted shall be used only for purposes ancillary to the principal operation of the site for a use falling within B2 and B8 uses, as detailed within the Town and Country Planning (Use Classes) Order 1987 (as amended) (or any provision equivalent to that Class in any Statutory Instrument revoking and/or re-enacting that Order).",
    "Reason:-",
    "The application has been assessed in context of these suggested uses and in view that this is a strategic industrial designation it is considered appropriate to restrict the office use as such.  This restriction is furthermore to comply with policy DC9 of the Development Control Policies Development Plan Document.  Applications for alternativ",
    "Prior to the first use of the development hereby approved, details of secure and covered cycle parking and electric vehicle charging points shall be submitted to the Local Planning Authority (LPA) for approval. The number of cycle parking spaces and electric vehicle charging points shall be based on the Adopted London Plan standards unless special circumstances can be demonstrated to the satisfaction of the LPA. The approved details shall be implemented in full prior to the first use of the building and shall be made permanently available for use, unless otherwise agreed in writing with the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To ensure that cycle parking accommodation and electric charging point are made permanently available within the development and that the development accords with policy DC35 of the Development Control Policies Development Plan Document and policy T5 of the London Plan.",
    "All building operations in connection with the construction of external walls, roof, and foundations; site excavation or other external site works; works involving the use of plant or machinery; the erection of scaffolding; the delivery of materials; the removal of materials and spoil from the site, and the playing of amplified music shall only take place between the hours of 8.00am and 6.00pm Monday to Friday, and between 8.00am and 1.00pm on Saturdays and not at all on Sundays and Bank Holidays/Public Holidays.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To protect nearby residential amenity, and in order that the development accords with the Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policy DC61.",
    "The necessary agreement, notice or licence to enable the proposed alterations to the Public Highway shall be entered into prior to the occupation of development.",
    "Reason:-",
    "In the interests of ensuring good design and ensuring public safety and to comply with Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policies CP10, CP17 and DC61.",
    "Prior to the commencement of relevant works, a scheme of hard and soft landscaping proposed to the front of site shall be submitted to and approved by the Local Planning Authority, which shall include indications of all existing trees and shrubs on the site, and details of any to be retained, together with measures for the protection in the course of development. All planting, seeding or turfing comprised within the scheme shall be carried out in the first planting season following completion of the development and any trees or plants which within a period of 5 years from completion of the development die, are removed or become seriously damaged or diseased shall be replaced in the next planting season with others of a similar size and species, unless otherwise agreed in writing by the local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:-",
    "Insufficient information has been supplied with the application to judge the appropriateness of the hard and soft landscaping proposed.  Submission of a scheme prior",
    "Before the development hereby permitted is first occupied, the area set aside for car parking shall be laid out and surfaced to the satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority and retained permanently thereafter for the accommodation of vehicles visiting the site and shall not be used for any other purpose.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To ensure that car parking accommodation is made permanently available to the standards adopted by the Local Planning Authority in the interest of highway safety, and that the development accords with the Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policy DC33.",
    "The development shall be undertaken in accordance with the tree protection measures detailed in the submitted 'Arboricultural Impact Assessment' Ref : 832, prepared by Greenwood Arboriculture, dated July 2020. Such  measures shall be implemented before development commences and kept in place until the approved development is completed.",
    "Reason:-",

    "The development shall be undertaken in accordance with the additional measures detailed in the submitted 'Mechanical Noise Report' Issue: 2, prepared by Base Energy Building Assessments for a Sustainable Environment, dated June 2020.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To protect nearby residential amenity and in order that the development accords with the Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policies DC55 and DC61.",
    "The proposed windows located on the northern elevation of the single storey rear extension hereby approved shall be permanently glazed with obscure glass not less than Level 4 on the standard scale of obscurity and shall thereafter be maintained.",
    "Reason:-",
    "In the interests of privacy, and in order that the development accords with the Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policy DC61.",
    "The Applicant is advised that planning approval does not constitute approval for changes to the public highway.  Highway Authority approval will only be given after suitable details have been submitted, considered and agreed. Any proposals which  involve building over the public highway as managed by the London Borough of Havering, will require a licence and the applicant must contact StreetCare, Traffic & Engineering on 01708 433750 to commence the Submission/ Licence Approval process.",
    "Should this application be granted planning permission, the developer, their representatives and contractors are advised that this does not discharge the requirements under the New Roads and Street Works Act 1991 and the Traffic Management Act 2004.  Formal notifications and approval will be needed for any highway works (including temporary works) required during the construction of the development.",
    "The developer is advised that if construction materials are proposed to be kept on the highway during c",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: No significant problems were identified during the consideration of the application, and therefore it has been determined in accordance with  the National Planning Policy Framework 2018.",
    "The developer is advised that if construction materials are proposed to be kept on the highway during construction works then they will need to apply for a license from the Council. If the developer requires scaffolding, hoarding or mobile cranes to be used on the highway, a license is required and Streetcare should be contacted on 01708 434343 to make the necessary arrangements.  Please note that unauthorised works on the highway is an offence.",
    "The developer is advised that surface water from the development in both its temporary and permanent states should not be discharged onto the highway.  Failure to prevent such is an offence.",
    "A Groundwater Risk Management Permit from Thames Water would be required for discharging groundwater into a public sewer. Any discharge made without a permit is deemed illegal and may result in prosecution under the provisions of the Water Industry Act 1991. Thames Water would expect the developer to demonstrate what measures would be proposed to minimise groundwater discharges into the public sewer. Permit enquiries should be directed to Thames Water's Risk Management Team on 02035779483 or at wwqriskmanagement@thameswater.co.uk.",
    "This permission relates solely to the proposed extensions and to no other development. The new signage will require separate advertisement application.",
    "Applicant is advised to adhere to the existing hours of operation on site.",
    "The proposal is liable for the Mayor of London Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). Based upon the information supplied with the application, the CIL payable would be an estimated Â£30,750 (this figure is based on the information supplied within the CIL form) subject to indexation. CIL is payable within 60 days of commencement of development.",
    "A Liability Notice will be sent to the applicant (or anyone else who has assumed liability) shortly and you are required to notify the Council of the commencement of the development before works begin. Further details with regard to CIL are available from the Council's website."
