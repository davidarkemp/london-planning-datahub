There would be conflict also with the National Planning Policy Framework, specifically Paras 130/134 which fundamentally require good design and that development add to the overall quality of the area.  Further to this the proposals would fail to respect minimum separation distances required by the Emerson Park Policy Area SPD and would therefore appear visually cramped which would be detrimental to the spacious character of the local area.The development would therefore be contrary also to Havering Local Plan Policies 7 and 26 and the design guidance within the Council's Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD.",
