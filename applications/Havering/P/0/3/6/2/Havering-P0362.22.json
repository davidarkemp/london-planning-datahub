    "The proposed hip-to-gable roof conversion would alter the basic shape of the roof on the semi-detached property which is unacceptable as it would imbalance between the pair and creates a visually heavy roof to one half causing a negative effect on the street scene via the loss of symmetry. Accordingly the proposal is of a poor quality design which is contrary to the purposes and intent of Local Plan Policy 7 and the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document.",
    "The proposed rear dormer window, by reason of its bulk and massing, would occupy an unacceptably large area of the rear roof slope,  forming a dominant, incongruous and visually intrusive feature, detrimental to the character and appearance of the property and materially harmful to the visual amenity of the surrounding area contrary to Local Plan Policy 7 and the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document.",
    "The proposed side/rear extension, by reason of its depth, would be an intrusive and unneighbourly development and have an adverse effect on the amenity of adjacent occupiers at No. 80 Sunnyside Gardens, contrary to Local Plan Policy 7 and the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to City Scape (agent) by e-mail on 16/05/22."
