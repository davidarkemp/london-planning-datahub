    "The proposed development would intensify the use of the site which would be harmful to the appearance and established character of the surrounding area contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD.",

The proposals are therefore contrary to Policy DC4, Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD, the Residential Design SPD and Policy 3.5 of The London Plan and the Mayor's housing SPG.",
    "The proposed rear extension would, by reason of its excessive depth and position close to the boundaries of the site, be an intrusive and unneighbourly development as well as having an adverse effect on the amenities of adjacent occupiers at No. 9 Glenwood Avenue contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to Mr Breden via email on 02/05/19."
