    "The development to which this permission relates must be commenced not later than three years from the date of the original permission P1499.20.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To comply with the requirements of Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended by Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004).",
    "The development hereby permitted shall not be carried out otherwise than in complete accordance with the approved plans of the original permission P1499.20.",

    "Reason:-",
    "Insufficient information has been supplied with the application to demonstrate what facilities will be available for cycle parking.
