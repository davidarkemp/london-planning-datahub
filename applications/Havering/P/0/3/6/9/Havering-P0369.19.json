    "The proposed development would, by reason of its scale, bulk and mass, appear incongruous and as be unacceptably dominant and visually intrusive feature in the street and rear garden scene, harmful to the character and appearance of the surrounding area, contrary to the Residential Extension and Alteration Supplementary Planning Document,Policies DC61 and DC69 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document and Policy 7.4 of the London Plan and the National Planning Policy Framework 2018.",
    "The site is within the area identified in the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document as Metropolitan Green Belt.  The proposed development would, by reason of its scale, bulk and mass, taking into account the cumulative impact of the enlarged replacement dwelling, result in disproportionate additions over and above the size of the original building and therefore, would be inappropriate in principle within the Green Belt. No special circumstances have been submitted in this case and the proposal is therefore contrary to Policies CP14 and DC45 of the adopted LDF Development Control Policies Development Plan Document, Policy 7.16 of the London Plan 2016 and the National Planning Policy Framework 2018.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to Ms Ram (Agent) by phone on 10/05/19.",
    "The proposal, if granted planning permission on appeal, would be liable for the Mayor of London Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). Based upon the information supplied with the application, the CIL payable would be Â£4,575. Further details with regard to CIL are available from the Council's website."
