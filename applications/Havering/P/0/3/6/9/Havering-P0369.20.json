  "description": "The erection of a two-storey, 1-bed, detached dwelling with associated parking and amenity space.",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed development would - by reason of its form, massing, appearance, prominent siting in relation to No.3 Southern Way, as well as its siting within the plot and distances from the boundary - result in a cramped form of development, would be unacceptable and uncharacteristic for the area, and would adversely impact on visual amenity in the street scene, and would be unacceptable when assessed against the National Planning Policy Framework 2019 [as amended], policies 7.4, 7.5 and 7.6 of the London Plan 2016 (MALP),  policies DC3 and DC61 of the Havering Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD 2008, and the Residential Design SPD 2010.",
    "The proposed extension would - by reason of its excessive depth, height, position and being close to the boundaries of the site - be an intrusive and unneighbourly development as well as having an adverse effect on the amenities of adjacent occupiers, and would be unacceptable when assessed against the National Planning Policy Framework 2019 [as amended], policies 7.4, 7.5 and 7.6 of the London Plan 2016 (MALP),  policies DC3 and DC61 of the Havering Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD 2008, and the Residential Design SPD 2010.",
    "Please be advised that approval of this application from 1st September 2019 (either by London Borough of Havering, or subsequently by PINS if allowed on appeal following a refusal by London Borough of Havering) will attract a liability payment of £6225 plus indexation in Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This charge has been levied under s.206 of the Planning Act 2008 and includes both the Mayor of London's CIL and Havering Council's CIL.",
    "London Borough of Havering, as CIL collecting authority, has responsibility for the collection of the Mayoral CIL, in addition to Havering's CIL, on commencement of the development.",
    "Based on an additional floorspace of 41.5 sq m, your proposal is subject to a CIL Liability Notice indicating a levy of £1037.50 plus indexation for the application, based on the Mayoral CIL levy rate for Havering of £25/sq.m, plus £5187.50 plus indexation based on Havering's charging rate for residential of £125/sq.m (Zone A).",
    "You are advised to visit the planning",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy and that no amendments to the scheme could not reasonably be achieved without further substantial delay to the application, it was considered necessary to assess the application as close to the statutory deadline as possible, in line with the expectations under paragraph 47 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2019 [as amended]."
