    "The proposed development materially change the contribution of the dwelling to street-scene, closing down lateral separation to the detriment of and inconsistent with local character. The additions cumulatively, namely the proposed first floor side extension and roof alterations would lack subservience and would contribute to a sense of overdevelopment and a dwelling which would be overly dominant and visually intrusive to the detriment of the street-scene and local character contrary to Policy DC61 of the London Borough of Havering LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD 2008, and the London Borough of Havering Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD 2011.",
    "The proposed development would through the alterations to the form of the roof, namely increased overall height, scale and bulk and lack of articulation would worsen the relationship with neighbouring dwellings through loss of light/overshadowing; loss of outlook resulting in an uncomfortable overbearing effect and an increased sense of enclosure. Furthermore the provision of a raised terraced area would lead to an increase sense of being overlooked/loss of privacy at odds with surrounding character and harmful to neighbouring amenity of those premises over greater distances. As such the development would be contrary Policy DC61 of the London Borough of Havering LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD 2008, and the London Borough of Havering Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD 2011.",
