  "description": "Two storey, 2-bed dwelling with cycle store and amenity space, following demolition of existing garage.",
  "site_name": "2 St Matthews Close",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The dwelling would form an incongruous feature in the area and would be conspicuous through its positioning and lack of spacing to the rear and it would present as visually cramped within the site to the detriment of the character of the area and visual amenity of the locality.  The proposals would therefore be contrary to Policies 10, 7 and 26 of the Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 and also the NPPF which requires fundamentally that development add to the overall quality of the area whilst also establishing or maintaining a strong sense of place.",
    "There would be a poor outlook to the rear of the new dwelling from the ground floor habitable room due to the proximity to the site boundaries and poor private amenity spaces for both the new and the host dwelling.  It is considered that the proposed development would result in a poor quality living environment for future occupiers, resulting in substandard residential accommodation to the detriment of the amenity of future occupants of the existing and proposed dwelling.  The proposals would therefore be contrary to Policies 10, 7 and 26 of the Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 and Policy D6 of the London Plan.",
    "The proposed development would, by reason of the loss of on-site parking for the host dwelling and no on-site car parking provision for the new dwelling, result in unacceptable overspill onto the adjoining roads to the detriment of highway and pedestrian safety and residential amenity and contrary Policies 23 & 24 of the Havering Local Plan 2016-2031.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, it was necessary to issue a decision as close to the statutory timeframe as possible as opposed to seeking amendments which would have significantly delayed the application.",
    "In the event that this application is allowed through the appeals process the proposals would be liable for the following CIL contributions:",
    "Mayoral CIL (MCIL2) contribution of £1850 (x £25 per sqm).",
    "Havering CIL (HCIL) contribution of £9250 (x £125 per sqm).",
    "Each contribution would be subject to indexation."
