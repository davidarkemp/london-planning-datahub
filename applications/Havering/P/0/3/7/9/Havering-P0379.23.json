    "The applicant has not provided any compelling evidence why Clause B should be removed from the S106 Agreement pursuant to Application reference P0743.93 which prevented the freehold of that land subject of that application from being sold or leased separately from the sale or lease of other land subject of that application. The agreement was required to ensure a close connection with occupiers of the main dwelling and annexe building as a result of the circumstances of the site which rendered independent occupation unacceptable through the quality of accommodation and close relationship to occupiers of the main dwelling.  Given that the relevance of the purpose for which the obligation was originally applied has not changed or diminished over the passage of time, the Council refuses this application to remove this obligation.",
