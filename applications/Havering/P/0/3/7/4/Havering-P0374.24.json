    "The site is within the Metropolitan Green Belt and the proposed development would not align fully with any of the exceptions set out in Section 13 of the NPPF and would therefore be comprised of inappropriate development. The proposed dwellings would through their number, scale, bulk, mass and position within the site form an unwanted urbanisation of the site which would have a profound and material impact on the openness of the Green Belt in this location and would conflict with the purposes of including land within it. In the absence of any Very Special Circumstances which would outweigh the harm of inappropriateness and harm to openness the proposed development is unacceptable in principle and in contrast to the objectives of the NPPF and Policy G2 of the London Plan 2021",
    "The proposed dwellings through their design, massing and arrangement on the site including relationship to shared boundaries would present as visually cramped when viewed from the street and the would form a visually dominant and overbearing feature in particular when travelling in an easterly direction on Shepherds Hill. The development would fail to reflect prevailing patterns of development and the established urban grain, as well as the constraints of the application site. The proposals would therefore be contrary to Policies 7 and 26 of the Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 and also Paragraph 130(a) of the NPPF which requires fundamentally that development add to the overall quality of the area whilst also establishing or maintaining a strong sense of place.",
    "Through the urbanisation of the site, quantum of development and arrangement of dwellings they would present as highly incongruous to the prevalent setting of the Grade II listed buildings nearby. They would read as visually dominant and would distract views of the assets. The scheme would therefore fail to contribute positively to the local character and distinctiveness, as required by Paragraph 197(c) of the NPPF as well as being contrary to Havering Local Plan Policy 28, London Plan Policy HC1 and the objectives of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (in particular sections 16, 66 and 72).",
