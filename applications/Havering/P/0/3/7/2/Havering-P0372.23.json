    "The development to which this permission relates must be commenced not later than three years from the date of this permission.",

    "To comply with the requirements of Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended by Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004).",
    "All new external finishes shall be carried out in materials to match those of the existing building(s) to the satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To safeguard the appearance of the premises and the character of the immediate area.",
    "During construction of the development hereby permitted, any trees within or near to the site shall be protected in accordance with the requirements of BS 5837 (2012) 'Trees in Relation to Design, Demolition and Construction'.  The protection measures shall be implemented prior to any below ground works and shall be retained for the entire period of the duration of any work at the site, in connection with the development hereby permitted.",
    "Reason: In order to maintain the existing vegetation at the site, which makes an important contribution to the character of the area, and to accord with Policies 27 of the Council's Local Plan.",
    "During construction of the development hereby permitted, the tree(s) located (36 Herbert Road, Hornchurch) shall not be lopped or felled without the written consent of the local planning authority.",
    "Reason: In order to maintain the existing vegetation at the site, which makes an important contribution to the character of the area, and to accord with Policy 27 of the Council's Local Plan.",
    "The development hereby approved shall be carried out strictly in accordance with the details set out on the Arboricultural Report November 2022 hereby approved. These measures shall be implemented before development commences and kept in place until the approved development is completed.",
    "Reason:-  In order that the preserved trees on site and in the vicinity of the site will be adequately protected during construction.",
    "The proposed 1.8m high obscured privacy screens on either side of the roof terrace as shown on drawings JS/SP1510/1/12, JS/SP1510/1/13 & JS/SP1510/1/14 shall be permanently glazed with obscure glass not less than level 4 on the standard scale of obscurity and shall thereafter be maintained.",
    "Reason:-",
    "In the interests of privacy.",
    "The development hereby permitted shall not be carried out otherwise than in complete accordance with the approved plans (as set out on page one of this decision notice).",
    "Reason:-",
    "For the avoidance of doubt and to ensure that the development is carried out as approved.",
    "Notwithstanding the provisions of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015, no window or other opening (other than those shown on the submitted and approved plan,) shall be formed in the flank wall(s) of the building(s) hereby permitted, unless specific permission under the provisions of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 has first been sought and obtained in writing from the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:-",
    "In order to ensure a satisfactory development that will not result in any loss of privacy or damage to the environment of neighbouring properties which exist or may be proposed in the future.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35(2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management) Order 2015: No significant problems were identified during the consideration of the application, and therefore it has been determined in accordance with paragraph 38 of the National Planning Policy Framework."
