    "The proposed side dormer and roof extensions, viewed cumulatively, would, by reason of their design, scale and bulk at roof level, appear as a visually intrusive and incongruous development  which is harmful to the character of the street scene and the building's appearance, contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD and Havering's Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD.",
    "The proposed side dormer would, by reason of its siting and design incorporating openings facing the neighbouring property, appear as an unneighbourly development which adversely impacts amenity by way of loss of privacy and overlooking between the two properties, contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD and the relevant polices of the London Plan and NPPF.",
