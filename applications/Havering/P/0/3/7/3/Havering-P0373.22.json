This is an intrusive site investigation including factors such as chemical testing, quantitative risk assessment and a description of the sites ground conditions.  An updated Site Conceptual Model should be included showing all the potential pollutant linkages and an assessment of risk to identified receptors.",

    "a) If, during development, contamination not previously identified is found to be present at the site then no further development (unless otherwise agreed in writing with the local planning authority) shall be carried out until a remediation strategy detailing how this unsuspected contamination shall be dealt with has been submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority. The remediation strategy shall be implemented as approved.",
    "b) Following completion of the remediation works as mentioned in (a) above, a 'Verification Report' must be submitted demonstrating that the works have been carried out satisfactorily and remediation targets have been achieved.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To ensure that any previously unidentified contamination found at the site is investigated and satisfactorily addressed in order to protect those engaged in order to protect those engaged in construction and occupation of the development from potential contamination.",

    "In order to ensure no water run-off from the hard surface which would contribute to risk of flooding.",
    "Prior to first occupation of the development, details shall be submitted to and agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority for the installation of Ultra-Low NOx boilers with maximum NOx Emissions less than 40 mg/kWh. Where any installations do not meet this emissions standard it should not be operated without the fitting of suitable NOx abatement equipment or technology as determined by a specialist to ensure comparable emissions. The installation of the boilers shall be carried out in strict accordance with the agreed details and shall thereafter be permanently retained. Following installation emissions certificates will need to be provided to the Local Planning Authority to verify boiler emissions.",

    "The development hereby approved shall be carried out strictly in accordance with the details set out on the Arboricultural Report and Impact Assessment and as per drawing no. RS/FAR/01, hereby approved. These measures shall be implemented before development commences and kept in place until the approved development is completed.",
    "Reason:-  In order that the preserved trees on site and in the vicinity of the site will be adequately protected during construction.",
    "The proposed development would create a new floor area equivalent to 74sqm new gross internal floor space. The proposal is therefore liable for Mayoral CIL (MCIL2) and would incur a charge of Â£1,850 based on the calculation of Â£25.00 per square metre.",
    "In addition the development would be liable for the Havering Community Infrastructure Levy (HCIL) which was adopted on September 1st 2019. In this location it translates to a charge of Â£125 per sqm of new floor space. This equates to a charge of Â£9,250.",
    "Each would be subject to indexation.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: In accordance with paragraph 38 of the National Planning Policy Framework, improvements required to make the proposal acceptable were negotiated with the agent in writing and on phone. The revisions involved setting the proposed building back from the existing front building line and internal layout alterations to provide at least one double bedroom. The amendments were subsequently submitted on 04/05/2022",
    "The developer is advised that if construction materials are proposed to be kept on the highway during construction works then they will need to apply for a license from the Council. If the developer requires scaffolding, hoarding or mobile cranes to be used on the highway, a license is required and Streetcare should be contacted on 01708434343 to make the necessary arrangements.",
    "Please note that unauthorised works on the highway is an offence.",
    "The granting of planning permission does not discharge the applicant from responsibilities under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 the contravention of which is a criminal offence.",
    "Precautionary advice for birds",
    "Birds are legally protected during the breeding season and need to be considered in respect of any impact from the proposed work. Work involving vegetation clearance must take place outside the optimum breeding season (March to August inclusive), unless it can be confirmed there are no breeding birds in the proposed work area. Note that birds frequently nest outside of the optimum period, particularly during spells of milder weather. It should never be assumed work can always take place without prior investigation.",
    "Birds generally tend to nest in dense shrub beds and mature trees. Where such vegetation may be affected by the proposed work it will require inspection for nesting birds. For example, but not exclusively, blackbird, dunnock, robin, blue and great tit, pigeons, magpies and crows.",
    "When reinstating vegetation and hardstand following building, install permeable surfaces, water butts and rain gardens. Plant a diverse mix of trees, shrubs and her",
