    "The modification sought to remove the Section 106 legal agreement for planning permission reference P0859.12 dated 13/11/2012 would remove the granny annex status of the building for use by dependent relatives of the occupants of the main dwelling (No. 3 Heath Close, Romford) as part of the same planning unit, sharing facilities including access, parking and amenity space and as such, would result in a separate detached dwelling unit which would be out of character with the Gidea Park Conservation Area and would have a substandard living accommodation for existing and future occupiers contrary policies 7 and 26 of Havering Local Plan 2021 and the National Planning Policy Framework which seeks to ensure a high standard of amenity for existing and future occupants of land and buildings. There is no other evidence to justify why the Section 106 legal agreement should be removed over the passage of time.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to the agent via email on 23rd May 2024.",
    "The applicant is advised that any subsequent application would be likely not to be validated and to exercise the right of appeal."
