    "The proposed development would by reason of the non-subservient side extension and uncharacteristic design for that row of terraces, would cause harm to the character and appearance of the host dwelling and the established character of the subject row of terraces and surrounding area, as well as prejudicing the non-attached neighbour to do a similar first floor side extension due to the siting of the extension on the boundary and closing of the characteristic gap and diminishing the open space character of the area. As such, the proposal is contrary to Policy DC61 of the London Borough of Havering LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document 2008, the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document 2011 and Policy 7.4 of the London Plan 2016.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to Mr Paul Robinson via email on 29 April 2020."
