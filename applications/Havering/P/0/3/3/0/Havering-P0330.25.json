  "description": "Retrospective application to retain a two storey side and part two storey, part single storey rear extensions, loft conversion with roof alterations, front and rear dormers  and proposed replacement of wooden fence with metal fence and installation of an extractor flue and canopy connection to the rear elevation for the proposed  conversion of the ground floor to restaurant",
  "site_name": "121 Mawney Road",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed use of the ground floor as a restaurant beyond 6pm, as restricted by Condition 7 of planning permission reference P1179.22, by reason of its location and relationship to surrounding residential properties, would result in an unsatisfactory relationship by way of noise and disturbance that would be detrimental of the amenity and living conditions of neighbouring occupiers in the evenings and late at night. Also, in the absence of any compelling evidence otherwise, such as a parking stress survey, the proposed use as a restaurant beyond 6pm is also deemed likely to contribute unacceptably to existing levels of parking stress and limited on-street spaces within the locality the evenings and late at night, to the detriment of the amenity of surrounding occupiers. Accordingly, the proposed use of the ground floor as a restaurant is considered contrary to the purposes and intent of Local Plan Policy 14 and Policies D14 and T6 of the London Plan.",
    "The proposed extractor flue, by reason of its bulk, scale and massing, would appear as a incongruous and visually intrusive feature within the street scene that would have an adverse impact on the character and appearance of the locality. Furthermore, by reason of its location and relationship to nearby sensitive receptors in particular surrounding residential properties, it would result in an unsatisfactory relationship by way of noise and disturbance from the ventilation equipment associated with the use which would be to the detriment of the amenity and living conditions of neighbouring occupiers. The proposed extractor flue would therefore contrary to Policies 7 and 26 of the Havering Local Plan and Policy D14 of the London Plan 2021 and the provisions of the NPPF.",
    "The two storey side and part two storey, part single storey rear extensions and loft conversion including rear dormers, when viewed cumulatively, together appear as a dominant and visually intrusive feature within the street scene that is detrimental to the character and appearance as well as the visual amenity of the subject building and surrounding locality. Accordingly, the extensions are of a poor quality design contrary to the purposes and intent of Local Plan Policies 7 and 26 as well as the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reasons for it was given to the agent via email on 11/07/2025.",
