    "The proposed side dormer windows by virtue of their excessive scale, bulk, mass, depth and lack of set back would appear incongruous, dominant, visually intrusive and be harmful to the appearance of the surrounding area contrary to the Havering Local Plan Policies 7 and 26, London Plan Policy D4 and the design guidance within the Council's Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD.",
    "The proposed development would, by reason of its position and proximity to neighbouring properties cause overlooking and loss of privacy which would have a serious and adverse effect on the living conditions of adjacent occupiers, contrary to Policy 7 of the Havering Local Plan and the design guidance within the Council's Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD.",
    "The proposed extension to the loft with its gabled roof, the side dormer window and the cumulative depth of the existing and proposed ground floor rear extensions would, by reason of its excessive depth, height and position close to the boundaries of the site, be an intrusive and unneighbourly development as well as having an adverse effect on the amenities of adjacent occupiers at No.118 Hubert Road, Rainham contrary to Policy 7 of the Havering Local Plan and the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document.",
