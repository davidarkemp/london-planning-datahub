  "site_name": "9 Barton Road",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed annexe would, by reason of its cramped appearance, scale, bulk, mass and position close to the boundaries of the site and projection forward of the neighbouring property, appears as an unacceptably dominant and visually intrusive feature in the street scene and rear garden environment harmful to the appearance of the surrounding area and inconsistent with the prevailing open character of the rear garden scene and pattern of development within the locality, contrary to Policy 26 of the Local Plan 2021, the Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD (2011), Policy D4 of the London Plan and also the guidance within the NPPF.",
    "The proposed development, by reason of its excessive depth, height, position close to the boundaries of the site and projection forward of No.1 Saunton Road, would be an intrusive and unneighbourly development as well as having an adverse effect on the amenities of adjacent occupiers contrary to Policy 7 of the Havering Local Plan and the Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD (2011).",
    "Preparation for Re-submission Informative",
    "The applicant should note that the proposal shown would be built up to all three boundaries. The proposal would have a pitched roof. It is noted that Certificate A on the application has been completed which means that no part of the development should encroach outside of the application site including guttering. Mindful that a gutter is required on the rear elevation due to the roof design, there may be encroachment. This matter would need to be clarified on any re-submission.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to Mr Karim (Agent) by e-mail on 20/05/25."
