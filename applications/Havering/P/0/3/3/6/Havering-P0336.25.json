  "description": "Erection of a two storey, 2-bed dwelling house with associated parking and amenities following demolition of existing detached dwelling house",
  "site_name": "17 King Edward Avenue",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed two-storey dwelling, by reason of its bulk, scale, proximity to shared boundaries and design poorly relates to the character of the adjacent properties, which is detrimental to the character and appearance of the immediate locality of the street scene. It therefore conflicts with the objectives of policy 26 of the Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 and policy D3 of the London Plan 2021.It furthermore conflicts with the National Planning Policy Framework to secure high quality design that maintains or enhances the character and appearance of the local area.",
    "The proposed dwelling would, by reason of its positioning, scale, bulk and proximity to the nearby properties, but particularly at no.19 King Edward Road, be an intrusive, overbearing and unneighbourly development that would have a significant adverse effect on the amenities of these adjacent occupiers resulting in an increased sense of enclosure with an overbearing impact contrary to Policy 7 of the Havering Local Plan and the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document.",
    "please be advised that approval of this application from 1st September 2019 (either by London Borough of Havering, or subsequently by PINS if allowed on appeal following a refusal by London Borough of Havering) will attract a liability payment in Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This charge has been levied under s.206 of the Planning Act 2008 and includes both the Mayor of London's CIL and Havering Council's CIL.",
    "London Borough of Havering, as CIL collecting authority, has responsibility for the collection of the Mayoral CIL, in addition to Havering's CIL, on commencement of the development.",
    "Your proposal is subject to a CIL Liability Notice indicating a levy of £1950 and £9750 plus indexation for the application, based on the Mayoral CIL levy rate for Havering of £25/sq.m plus Havering's charging rate for residential of £125/sq.m.",
    "You are advised to visit the planning portal website where you can download the appropriate document templates.",
    "http://www.planningportal.gov.uk/",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, it was necessary to issue a decision as close to the statutory timeframe as possible as opposed to seeking amendments which would have significantly delayed the application."
