  "site_name": "35 Pemberton Avenue",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed two storey side staircase extension would, by reason of its proportions, height and design, including flat roof, appear as an incongruous development in relation to the existing host building, and appear as an alien and visually intrusive feature in the street scene, and the surrounding area, especially from the junction with Hall Road. As such, the proposal is contrary to Policies 7 & 26 of the Havering Local Plan and the Council's Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD (2011).",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to Mrs C Sayer via e-mail on 10 June 2025."
