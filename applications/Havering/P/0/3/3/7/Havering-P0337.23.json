    "The proposed development would, by reason of its positioning, depth and proximity to the northern neighbour at No. 92 Plumpton Avenue dominate the outlook of the common property boundary and reduce the availability of light into the rear garden environment of the neighbouring property which would have a serious and adverse effect on the living conditions of adjacent occupiers, contrary to Policy 7 of the Local Plan.",
