    "The site is within the area identified as Metropolitan Green Belt. Government Guidance as set out in the National Planning Policy Framework is that in order to achieve the purposes of the Metropolitan Green Belt it is essential to retain and protect the existing open character of the area so allocated and that the new buildings will only be permitted in certain circumstances. The proposed extension would result in disproportionate addition to the property over and above its original form and would also by way of the overall bulk and amount of development, reduce the openness of the Green Belt and therefore cause harm. No special circumstances have been submitted in this case. The development proposals are therefore contrary to Policy G2 of the London Plan and the guidance in the National Planning Policy Framework.",
