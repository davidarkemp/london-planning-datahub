    "The proposal gives rise to undersized and poor standard of accommodation, to the detriment of the living conditions of future occupiers, in particular by reason of the insufficient gross internal floor area and the lack of amenity space afforded to the first floor flat. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy 3.5 of the London Plan 2016, and Policies DC4 and DC61 of the London Borough of Havering LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD 2008.",
    "The proposal by reason of the inadequate on site car parking provision and arrangement, would result in unacceptable overspill onto the adjoining roads and conflict with pedestrians and highway users, to the detriment of highway safety and residential amenity, contrary to Policies DC32 and DC33 of the London Borough of Havering LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD 2008.",
    "The proposal results in an increase of noise and disturbance at the property, causing harm to neighbouring residential amenity and adversely effecting the living conditions of adjacent occupiers, contrary to Policy DC61 of the London Borough of Havering LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD 2008.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reasons for it was given to the agent and applicant via email on 15/07/2019."
