    "The development to which this permission relates must be commenced not later than three years from the date of this permission.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To comply with the requirements of Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended by Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004).",
    "The development hereby permitted shall not be carried out otherwise than in complete accordance with the approved plans (as set out on page one of this decision notice).",
    "Reason:-",
    "For the avoidance of doubt and to ensure that the development is carried out as approved.",
    "The proposed development hereby approved shall be constructed in accordance with the materials detailed on the plans hereby approved with the colour to closely match the finished material as those existing unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason: To ensure that the appearance of the proposed development will harmonise with the character of the surrounding area and comply with Policy DC61 of the Development Control Policies Development Plan Document",
    "All building operations in connection with the construction of external walls, roof, and foundations; site excavation or other external site works; works involving the use of plant or machinery; the erection of scaffolding; the delivery of materials; the removal of materials and spoil from the site, and the playing of amplified music shall only take place between the hours of 8.00am and 6.00pm Monday to Friday, and between 8.00am and 1.00pm on Saturdays and not at all on Sundays and Bank Holidays/Public Holidays.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To protect residential amenity, and in order that the development accords with the Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policy DC61.",
    "No works shall take place in relation to any of the development hereby approved until a Construction Method Statement to control the adverse impact of the development on the amenity of the public and nearby occupiers is submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority. The Construction Method statement shall include details of:",
    "a)  parking of vehicles of site personnel and visitors;",
    "b)  storage of plant and materials;",
    "c)  dust management controls;",
    "d)  measures for minimising the impact of noise and ,if appropriate, vibration arising from construction activities;",
    "e)  predicted noise and, if appropriate, vibration levels for construction using methodologies and at points agreed with the Local Planning Authority;",
    "f)  scheme for monitoring noise and if appropriate, vibration levels using methodologies and at points agreed with the Local Planning Authorities;",
    "g)  siting and design of temporary buildings;",
    "h)  scheme for security fencing/hoardings, depicting a readily vis",
    "Statement Required by Article 35(2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management) Order 2015: No significant problems were identified during the consideration of the application, and therefore it has been determined in accordance with paragraph 38 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2018.",
    "This planning permission does not remove the need to obtain any separate consent of the owner of the adjoining property prior to commencing building works on, under, above or immediately adjacent to their property (e.g. foundations or guttering). The Party Wall Etc. Act 1996 contains requirements to serve notice on adjoining owners of property under certain circumstances, and a procedure exists for resolving disputes. This is a matter of civil law between the two parties, and the Local Planning Authority are not involved in such matters.",
