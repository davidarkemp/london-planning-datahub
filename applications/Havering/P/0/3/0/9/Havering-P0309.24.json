    "The original dwelling has a gross internal floor space of approximately 71 square metres, which fails to meet the standard of 120 square metres,  thereby resulting in the unacceptable loss of a much needed family homes within the Borough, contrary to Policy 8(i) of the Havering Local Plan 2021.",
    "The intensification of the site would generate high levels of activity and result in an unacceptable impact on neighbouring residential occupiers in terms of noise and general disturbance associated with the proposed HMO use contrary to Policies 7 and 8 of the Havering Local Plan 2021.",
    "The size of the kitchen/dining and living area is insufficient and would be harmful to the amenity of the future occupiers of the HMO, failing to meet with the requirements of the East London HMO guidance and would therefore fail to provide an adequate living environment for all occupants, contrary to Policies 7 and 8 of the Local Plan 2021 and Policy D6 of the London Plan 2021 and the London Housing Design Guide 2023.",
    "The proposal fails to provide adequate levels of off-street parking for the level of occupation proposed, resulting in increased pressure on on-street parking to the detriment of the safe and efficient operation of the highway and convenience of occupiers of neighbouring properties. In this respect, the proposal would be contrary to Policies 8 and 24 of the Local Plan.",
