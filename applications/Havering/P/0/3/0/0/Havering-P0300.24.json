    "The proposed development does not provide a lift and therefore fails to meet M4(2) and achieve the highest standards of accessible and inclusive design. As such the proposals are contrary to Policy 7 of the Havering Local Plan, Policies D5 and D7 of the London Plan and the guidance in the National Planning Policy Framework.",

    "Flats 2, 4, 5, 7 & 8 would, by reason of their single aspect layout and siting, result in a poor quality living environment for future residents through limited outlook, contrary to Policy 7 of the Havering Local Plan and Policy D6 of the London Plan.",
    "The proposed development would, by reason of its siting, layout and proximity to the boundaries of the site, prejudice the development potential of the adjoining land to the north, east and south of the site contrary to Policy 10 of the Havering Local Plan.",
    "The petrol filling station located to the north west of the site would result in unacceptable noise levels for the private amenity areas of the proposed flats at the first and second floor levels, which would be harmful to the amenity of future occupiers contrary to Policies 7 and 34 of the Havering Local Plan, Policy D14 of the London Plan and the guidance in the National Planning Policy Framework.",
    "The proposed development would, by reason of its layout, result in inadequate servicing arrangements contrary to Policy 35 of the Havering Local Plan and Policy T7 of the London Plan.",
    "In the absence of a Section 106 agreement to provide a contribution towards relocating the bollard and signage adjacent to the north of the site, the proposal is contrary to Policy 23 of the Havering Local Plan and Policy T4 of the London Plan.",
    "The proposed development does not adequately assess the development's impact on the nearby culvert including assessment of the flood risk impact of development close to the culvert contrary to Policy 32 of the Havering Local Plan, Policy SI 12 of the London Plan 2021 and the guidance contained in the National Planning Policy Framework.",
    "In the absence of a Section 106 agreement to provide a contribution towards funding delivery of active transport improvements, in the vicinity of the site in Rainham village, the development would conflict with the requirements of Policies 2, 12 (vi), and 23 of the Havering Local Plan and Policies T2, T4, and T5 of the London Plan.",
