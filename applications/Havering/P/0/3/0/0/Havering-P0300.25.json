    "In the absence of a noise report, sufficient evidence of the exact character and nature of the use, it can be concluded that the proposal would, by reason of its location and relationship to neighbouring properties, result in an unsatisfactory relationship by way of noise and disturbance caused by levels of activity, delivery and vehicle movements and associated plant and machinery within the premises and combined with the proposed hours of use, be unacceptably detrimental to the amenities of occupiers of adjacent residential properties. Furthermore, the nature of the business proposed and location in residential environment would be detrimental to the character of the area. In this respect, the proposal is contrary to Policies 7, 34 and 35 of the Havering Local Plan and the National Planning Policy Framework.",
    "The proposal fails to demonstrate adequate levels of off street parking and the ability of the shared access to accommodate the level of use proposed. The proposed shared alleyway access, combined with the insufficient details regarding the scale and level of proposal is considered likely to lead to increased vehicle use of the access and overspill, which would contribute unacceptably to existing levels of parking stress and limited on-street spaces within the locality to the detriment of the amenity of surrounding occupiers. The absence of any compelling evidence otherwise, such as a parking stress survey, means that it has not been demonstrated that there would not be conflict with Policy 24, London Plan T6 and Para 115 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2024.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, it was necessary to issue a decision as close to the statutory timeframe as possible as opposed to seeking amendments which would have significantly delayed the application."
