    "The site is situated on a small cul-de-sac within a residential area where the level of pedestrian and vehicular traffic is proportionate with the surrounding houses in the street against a relatively low level of background noise.  A seven room HMO would generate a significant amount of vehicle movement and the coming and goings of residents throughout the day and night, and the associated activities such as the use of gardens by an increased number of residents, would be harmful to the amenity of neighbouring dwellings. As such the proposal would result in an intensification of the site and result in significant harm to residential amenity from noise, disturbance and the associated activities with a large HMO in a quiet area, contrary to Policies 7 and 8 of the Havering Local Plan and the guidance contained in the National Planning Policy Framework.",
