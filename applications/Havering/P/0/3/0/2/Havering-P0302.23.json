    "The proposed outbuilding through its excessive depth, width and overall height would form a prominent and intrusive feature out of character the surrounding environment, that would have a signficant adverse impact to the detriment of the openness of the Green Belt. The development would fail to align fully with any of the exceptions given within the NPPF and no Very Special Circumstance case has been made which overcomes the in principle and other harm identified, and be contrary to Policy G2 of the London Plan.",
    "The proposed development would by reason of its scale, bulk and mass and lack of subservience appear as an unacceptably dominant and visually intrusive feature within the landscape and to the area more generally. It would be contrary to the objectives of the NPPF, specifically Para 130 which requires development add to the overall quality of the area, Policies 7 and 26 of the Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 and the Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD 2008.",
