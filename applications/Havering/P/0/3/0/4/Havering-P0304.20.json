    "The proposed development would by reason of its gable ended roof design and limited set back from the front of the dwelling at first floor level appear as a non-subservient addition to the property, resulting in unbalancing to the existing dwelling and appear as an unacceptably dominant and visually intrusive feature in the streetscene harmful to the character and appearance of the host dwelling and surrounding area. As such, the proposal is contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD, and Policy 7.4 of the London Plan 2016.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to the agent Mr Jeeten Patel by email on 14/05/2020"
