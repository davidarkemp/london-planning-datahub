  "decision_conditions": [
    "The development hereby permitted shall not be carried out otherwise than in complete accordance with the approved plans (as set out on page one of this decision notice).",
    "Reason:-",
    "The Local Planning Authority consider it essential that the whole of the development is carried out and that no departure whatsoever is made from the details approved, since the development would not necessarily be acceptable if partly carried out or carried out differently in any degree from the details submitted.  Also, in order that the development accords with Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policy DC61.",
    "Notwithstanding the provisions of the Town and Country Planning (Use Classes) Order 1987 (as amended) the use hereby permitted shall be as a beauty salon only and shall be used for no other purpose(s) whatsoever unless otherwise submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To restrict the use of the premises to one compatible with the surrounding area and to enable the Local Planning Authority to exercise control over any future use not forming part of this application, and that the development accords with the Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policy DC61",
    "The premises shall not be used for the purposes hereby permitted other than between the hours of 10:00 and 18:00 Mondays to Fridays and 08:00 and 18:00 on Saturdays, without the prior consent in writing of the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To enable the Local Planning Authority to retain control in the interests of amenity, and in order that the development accords with Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policy DC61.",
    "Within three months of the date of this decision notice details of a waste management scheme must be submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority. The scheme shall include details of the method and location of refuse and recycling storage, including provision for all refuse to be properly contained within the approved facility, together with arrangements for refuse disposal. The scheme shall be implemented on site, in accordance with the approved details, prior to the first occupation or commencement of the use hereby approved and retained permanently thereafter.",
    "Reason:-",
    "Insufficient information has been supplied with the application to judge how waste will be managed on site.  Submission of this detail prior to occupation in the case of new building works or prior to the use commencing in the case of changes of use will protect the amenity of occupiers of nearby premises, and ensure that the development accords with the Development Control Policies Developme",
    "The applicant is advised that the display of advertisements or signage in association with the business premises may require the consent of the local authority.",
    "The applicant is advised that this decision only gives planning permission for the use as a beauty salon.  The applicant is reminded that separate licences may be required for the operation of a beauty salon and is advised to contact the London Borough of Havering Environmental Health (Public Protection team) regarding any other operational licences that may be required.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: No significant problems were identified during the consideration of the application, and therefore it has been determined in accordance with paragraphs 186-187 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2012."
