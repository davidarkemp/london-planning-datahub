    "The proposed development would, by reason of its, limited internal communal space and poor layout result in a poor quality living environment harmful to the amenity of the existing and future occupiers of the site contrary to Policies 7 and 8 of the Havering Local Plan, the East London HMO Guidance and the policy guidance contained in National Planning Policy Framework.",
    "The site is situated on a small cul-de-sac within a residential area where the level of pedestrian and vehicular traffic is proportionate with the surrounding houses in the street against a relatively low level of background noise.   It is considered that the eight room HMO would generate a significant amount of vehicle movement and the coming and goings of residents throughout the day and night, and the associated activities such as the use of gardens by increased number of residents, would be likely to give rise to amenities of the nearby dwelling. As such the proposal would result in an intensification of the site and result in significant harm to residential amenity from noise, disturbance and the associated activities with a large HMO dwelling in a quiet area, contrary to Policies 7 and 8 of the Havering Local Plan and the guidance contained in the National Planning Policy Framework.",
    "The proposal would result in increased parking congestion in an area with limited capacity for on street parking spaces, thereby having adverse impact upon the safety of highways condition and the free flow of traffic, contrary to Policies 8 and 24 of the Havering Local Plan and the guidance contained in the National Planning Policy Framework.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to STATE WHO, HOW (EMAIL/PHONE/MEETING) AND WHEN."
