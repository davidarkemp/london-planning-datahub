    "The proposed parking arrangements would result in an over-provision of car parking spaces, which would exceed the maximum parking standards set out in the London Plan failing to promote sustainable travel and reduce car dominance and act as a discouragement to using public transport. The proposals are contrary to policy 24 of the Local Plan 2021 and London Plan (2021) policies T6 and T6.1.",

To relocate one of the car parking spaces to the rear and propose only one space within the forecourt. No response has been received.",
    "The proposal, if granted planning permission on appeal would be liable for mayoral CIL and Havering CIL. The site lies in the south (Zone B) Havering CIL charging area, and therefore would have a total of £12,000.00 CIL liability subject to indexation.",
