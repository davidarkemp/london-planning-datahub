    "The proposed development would, by reason of its excessive scale, bulk, height and mass, and close proximity to neighbouring boundaries appear as an unacceptably dominant, oppressive and visually intrusive feature in the streetscene, and in the rear garden environment, resulting in harm to the amenity of adjoining occupiers as well as the  wider area and be harmful to visual amenity and detrimental to the character and appearance of the surrounding area contrary to Local Plan Policies 26 and 28.",
    "In the absence of a daylight and sunlight report to demonstrate otherwise, the proposed development is judged likely to have an unacceptable impact on the daylight and sunlight received within the rear rooms of No. 14 Nelmes Way and due to the close proximity to the boundary with this would overshadow its rear garden contrary to Local Plan Policy 7.",
    "The proposal, if granted planning permission on appeal, would be liable for the Mayor of London and Havering Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). The proposed development will create 1 new residential unit with 671sqm of new gross internal floorspace. The proposal is liable for LB Havering CIL and will incur a charge of £68,250 (subject to indexation) based on the calculation of £125.00 per square metre. The proposal is also liable for Mayoral CIL and will incur a charge of £13,650 (subject to indexation) based on the calculation of £25.00 per square metre.",
