    "The proposal would create an overly bulky roof form, with an element of flat roof in the form of a crown roof. This type of roof form for two storey dwellings in the street would be an isolated roof type and hence it is judged the proposed development would appear as an uncharacteristic and visually intrusive development within the street that would be detrimental to the appearance of the street scene. Furthermore, the angle of the main roof are designed with steeper pitch than that of the front gable feature, something which would form an incongruous feature of the dwelling and thereby compromise the integrity of its architectural design. In these respects, the proposal would be contrary to Local Plan Policies 7 and 26 as well as Paragraph 135(d) of the NPPF which requires fundamentally that development add to the overall quality of the area whilst also establishing or maintaining a strong sense of place.",
