  "description": "Change of use from a use class C3 (dwellinghouse) to a six person HMO",
  "site_name": "43 COWPER ROAD",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The original dwelling has a gross internal floor space of 63.73 square metres, which fails to meet the standard of 120 square metres contrary to Policy 8 of the Havering Local Plan. The proposal would therefore have an adverse impact on the supply of family housing within the Borough, the loss of which is not adequately justified and which could set an undesirable precedent for similar development in the locality.",
    "The communal living room fails to meet the area of 16 square metres of communal space, the kitchen would be more than one floor away from the occupiers on the second floor and with the addition of the kitchen being less than 9.5 square metres for 6 sharers, which would provide a poor quality living environment harmful to the amenity of future occupiers contrary to Policies 7 and 8 of the Havering Local Plan, the HMO East London Guidance and the policy guidance contained in National Planning Policy Framework.",
    "The poor layout of the site creates conditions that result in undue overlooking and loss of privacy to the ground floor  bedroom 1 of the HMO from the communal rear garden, which provides a poor quality living environment harmful to the amenity of existing occupiers contrary to Policies 7 and 8 of the Havering Local Plan and the guidance contained in the National Planning Policy Framework.",
    "The proposal would result in an intensification of activity at the site and result in significant harm to residential amenity from noise, disturbance and activity, where comings and goings are likely to be particularly noticeable given the nature of the residential cul-de-sac location contrary to Policies 7 and 8 of the Havering Local Plan and the policy guidance contained in National Planning Policy Framework.",
    "The HMO would result in an intensification of use, mindful that there is no on-site parking with the proposal creating a HMO for up to 6 occupiers and would give rise to increased parking stress and competition for on street parking spaces contrary to Policies 8 and 24 of the Havering Local Plan, Policy T6.1 of the London Plan and the guidance contained in the National Planning Policy Framework.",
    "Planning Enforcement Investigation Informative",
    "This application is subject to a Planning Enforcement investigation and given the refusal of this application formal enforcement action may therefore be taken.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to Mrs Nawab via email on 02/06/2025."
