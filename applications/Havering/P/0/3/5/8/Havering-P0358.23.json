    "The proposed outbuilding through the design concept progressed, siting and massing would appear unacceptably dominant and visually intrusive feature in the rear garden environment, crowding the site with development and reducing the amenity areas to 7 and 7A Birkbeck Road unacceptably and would therefore be harmful to the character and appearance of the surrounding area, contrary to Policiy 26 of the Havering Local Plan 2016-2031,  the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document and the guidance contained within the NPPF.",
    "The proposal outbuilding would by reason of its scale, bulk mass and coverage of the site have an impact on the amenity of existing and future occupants of nos. 7, 7A and 9 Birkbeck Road through reducing further constrained amenity areas leading to a sense of overbearing and enclosure, whilst also impeding further the amount of light received to areas which were already of limited overall quality.  It would be contrary to Policies 7 and 26 of the Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 and the Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD through this resultant harm and the guidance contained within the NPPF.",
