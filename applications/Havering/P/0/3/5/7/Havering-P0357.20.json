    "The proposed development by reason of its siting, design, scale and bulk, would result in the unbalancing of the pair of semi-detached properties and disrupt the pattern of development along Cedar Road, that would be harmful to the character of the original dwelling as well as the streetscape. Therefore the proposal is contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD and the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document (Adopted 2011).",
