    "The proposed additional use (sui generis) would, by reasons of its location and relationship to the communal area with no clear layout plan, design, materials, seating area and the general operational management of the proposed use, result in an encroachment onto the communal area, unsatisfactory relationship and its proximity to the residential uses by way of noise and general disturbance which would be to the detriment of the amenity and living conditions of neighbouring occupiers. The proposed development is therefore contrary to Policy 7 of the Local Plan 2021 and Policy HC7 of the London Plan 2021.",
