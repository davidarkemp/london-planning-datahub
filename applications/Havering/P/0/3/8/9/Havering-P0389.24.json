Accordingly it is considered that a householder application has been submitted prematurely as the subject of the full planning application has not been completed in accordance with the approved plans.",
    "The proposed gabled end would represent a significant increase in mass at roof level, which would not reflect the character of the terraced row, or the scheme as it was approved. The resultant dwelling would upset the rhythm of the terraced row and would present as visually dominant, detrimental to local character and the street-scene. As such the development would be detrimental to the character and appearance of the host property and local character and would therefore be contrary to Havering Local Plan Policies 7 and 26 and the design guidance within the Council's Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD.",
