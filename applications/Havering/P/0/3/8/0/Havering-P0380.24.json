    "The scale and bulk of the proposed loft conversion including the hip to gable roof alteration and rear dormer window  would appear as an incongruous and unacceptably visually harmful feature in the street scene and rear garden environment harmful to the appearance of the host property and the prevailing character of development in the surrounding area contrary to Policy 26 of the Havering Local Plan, D4 of the London Plan and the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document.",
    "The proposed development would, by reason of its excessive scale, bulk, mass and position close to the boundaries of the site, give rise to  an intrusive and unneighbourly development resulting in a loss of outlook and having an intrusive and overbearing effect on the amenities of adjacent occupiers within Oldmead Close and 120 Gooshays Drive, contrary to Policies 7 and 26 of the Havering Local Plan and the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document.",
    "The proposal would result in a loss of the existing photovoltaics on the existing dwelling which would be contrary to condition No.31 of planning application P1451.10 and Policy 36 of the Havering Local Plan, Policies Policy SI 2 and Policy SI 3 of the London Plan 2021 and the NPPF.",
