    "The proposed windows and doors shall be as outlined on the approved plans with Eco Slide PVC-U sash windows finished in white and the appearance of the windows as similar to the existing as possible, including vertical sliders and sash horns unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason: To ensure that the appearance of the proposed development will harmonise with the character of the surrounding area and comply with Policies 7, 26 and 28 of the Havering Local Plan Adopted November 2021.",
