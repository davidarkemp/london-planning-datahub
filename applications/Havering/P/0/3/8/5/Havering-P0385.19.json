    "The proposed single storey rear extension in addition to the existing single storey rear extension would result in an overall depth and scale which would be excessive, lack subservience to the existing dwelling and appear dominant and visually intrusive in the rear garden environment  contrary to policy DC61 of the LDF and the Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD.",
    "The proposed single storey rear extension would, by reason of its excessive scale, height and bulk be un-neighbourly which would give rise to an uncomfortable overbearing effect such as an increased sense of enclosure, loss of outlook and overshadowing and be harmful to the amenity of No.28 Whitethorn Gardens contrary to Policy DC61 of the London Borough of Havering LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD 2008, and the London Borough of Havering Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD 2011.",
