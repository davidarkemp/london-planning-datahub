    "The proposed development would, by reason of roof form, faÃ¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿§ade design and fenestration arrangement, give rise to a contrived form of development that is incongruous with the local character and would materially detract from the built form character of the local street scene. In addition, the introduction of the design will introduce a visually intrusive feature in the streetscene harmful to the appearance of the surrounding area contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD.",
    "The proposed development would result in living conditions that create a poor quality living environment for future occupiers. The proposed design will result in an unacceptable relationship between the shared amenity space and Unit 8 and Unit 5 which will result in disturbance and a loss of privacy for future occupants of the units, contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to the agent via email and telephone on 23/4/20.",
    "The proposal, if granted planning permission on appeal, would be liable for the Mayor of London Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and Havering CIL. Based upon the information supplied with the application, the CIL payable would be £1,215. Further details with regard to CIL are available from the Council's website."
