    "The proposed development would, by reason of its scale, bulk and mass, appear incongruous and cramped and be unacceptably dominant and visually intrusive feature in the street and rear garden scene, harmful to the character and appearance of the surrounding area, contrary to the Residential Extension and Alteration Supplementary Planning Document and Policy DC61 and DC69 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to Mr Matambanadzo (Agent) by phone on 10/05/19.",
