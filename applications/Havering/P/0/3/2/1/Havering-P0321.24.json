    "To comply with the requirements of Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended by Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004).",
    "The development hereby permitted shall not be carried out otherwise than in complete accordance with the approved plans (as set out on page one of this decision notice).",
    "Reason:-",
    "For the avoidance of doubt and to ensure that the development is carried out as approved.",
    "Notwithstanding the details shown on the submitted and approved drawings accompanying the application, the proposed ground floor rear extension hereby approved shall be finished in timber cladding unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To safeguard the appearance of the premises and the character of the immediate area.",

The amendments involved revisions to the roof design of the proposal and of the dwelling and were subsequently submitted on 25/04/2024."
