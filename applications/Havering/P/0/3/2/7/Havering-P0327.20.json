    "The proposed self-contained unit would result in living conditions that do not create a suitably high quality living environment for future occupiers. The constraints of the site and approach result in significant failings in respect of internal spacing standards which, combined with the absence of suitable outdoor amenity space, would be to the detriment of the amenity of future occupiers. The arrangement of living accommodation would be substandard and would give rise to an overwhelming sense of enclosure in direct contrast to the aims of London Plan Policy 3.5, Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD and the National Planning Policy Framework.",
