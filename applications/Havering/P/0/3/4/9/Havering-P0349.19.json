  "description": "Demolition of existing single storey garage block and the erection of a new three-storey building consisting of 4 residential units (2 X 1-bed, 2 X 2-bed) and 9 car spaces at ground floor level.",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed development would, by reason of its height, bulk and massing, appear as an unacceptably dominant and visually intrusive feature in the streetscene. The proposed development would therefore be harmful to the character and appearance of the surrounding area contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD, Policy 7 of the Draft Havering Local Plan, and Policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan.",
    "The proposed development would, by reason of its height, scale, siting and proximity to neighbouring properties result in a significant loss of outlook, an increased sense of enclosure and have an overbearing impact, which would have a serious and adverse effect on the living conditions of adjacent occupiers, contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD and Policy 7 of the Draft Havering Local Plan.",
    "Insufficient information has been submitted with the application in order to demonstrate that the proposed development would not result in an inadequate on-site car parking provision, resulting in an unacceptable overspill onto the adjoining roads to the detriment of the safety of pedestrians and other road users and residential amenity, contrary to Policy 33 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD and Policy 24 of the Draft Havering Local Plan.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to the agent via email.",
    "The proposal, if granted planning permission on appeal, would be liable for the Mayor of London and Havering Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). Based on a lack of the information supplied with the application, it is not possible to calculate the CIL payable for the Mayoral CIL and Havering CIL. Further details with regard to CIL are available from the Council's website."
