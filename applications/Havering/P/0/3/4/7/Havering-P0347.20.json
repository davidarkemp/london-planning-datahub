  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed dwelling would through its design and appearance, resultant plot size and arrangement represent a departure from the established urban grain. It would read in the context of its surroundings as an outcast and incongruous form of development disjointed from its surroundings detrimental to and at odds with local character, thereby contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD and the National Planning Policy Framework.",
    "The proposed development would result in living conditions that do not create a suitably high quality living environment for future occupiers. The constraints of the site in conjunction with the design approach adopted would be to the detriment of the amenity of existing and future occupiers. The constrained plot and arrangement of living accommodation would be substandard and give rise to an overwhelming sense of enclosure in direct contrast to the aims of London Plan Policy 3.5, Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD and the National Planning Policy Framework.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to the agent in writing 29-04-2020",
    "Please note also that should permission be granted, from 1st September 2019 (either by London Borough of Havering, or subsequently by PINS if allowed on appeal following a refusal by London Borough of Havering) will attract a liability payment of £2,550 plus indexation in Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This charge has been levied under s.206 of the Planning Act 2008 and includes both the Mayor of London's CIL and Havering Council's CIL.",
    "London Borough of Havering, as CIL collecting authority, has responsibility for the collection of the Mayoral CIL, in addition to Havering's CIL, on commencement of the development. Based upon calculations undertaken by the case officer and information supplied with the application your proposal is subject to a CIL Liability Notice indicating a levy of £425 plus indexation for the application, based on the Mayoral CIL levy rate for Havering of £25/sq.m plus Havering's charging rate for residential of £55/sq.m (Zone B) and the floorspace of 17 sq",
    "Due to the COVID-19 pandemic and social distancing measures implemented, a site visit was not undertaken by the case officer. For the purposes of assessing the proposed development a combination of historic photographs, including those from the previous submission, street-view, relevant aerial photography and historic records including drawings were utilised."
