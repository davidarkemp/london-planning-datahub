  "decision_conditions": [
    "The development to which this permission relates must be commenced not later than three years from 18/9/20.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To comply with the requirements of Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended by Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004).",

    "Reason:-",
    "The Local Planning Authority consider it essential that the whole of the development is carried out and that no departure whatsoever is made from the details approved, since the development would not necessarily be acceptable if partly carried out or carried out differently in any degree from the details submitted.  Also, in order that the development accords with Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policy DC61.",
    "The building is to be constructed in accordance with the materials approved under planning permission Q0036.21 dated 08/04/2021 unless otherwise agreed in writing with the local planning authority.",

    "Reason: To protect public health and to manage and prevent further deterioration of existing low quality air across London in accordance with London Plan policy 5.3 and 7.14, and NPPF 181.",
    "Notwithstanding the approved elevations, no French doors are to be installed on the northern elevation of the building.",
    "Reason:- To preserve the amenity of the neighbouring residential property to the north.",
    "Refuse and recycling facilities are to be implemented prior to occupation of the development in accordance with the details approved under planning permission Q0036.21 dated 08/04/2021 unless otherwise agreed in writing with the local planning authority.",

    "Reason:-",
    "In the interests of amenity and to enable the Local Planning Authority to retain control over future development, and in order that the development accords with Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policy DC61.",
    "The dwelling hereby approved shall be constructed to comply with Part M4(2) of the Building Regulations - Accessible and Adaptable Dwellings.",
    "Reason:-",
