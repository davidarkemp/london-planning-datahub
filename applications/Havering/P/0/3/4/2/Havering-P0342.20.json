    "The proposed development would, by reason of its narrow subdivision configuration and bulk, mass and scale within close proximity of the side boundaries, incorporating gable end walls and large front dormer windows, appears unacceptably dominant and visually intrusive feature in the streetscene harmful to the appearance of the surrounding area and inconsistent with the prevailing character of the local area, contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD, the Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD and the relevant polices of the London Plan and NPPF.",
    "The proposed development would, by reason of its siting, scale, bulk and positioning close to the boundary including openings to habitable rooms, be an intrusive and unneighbourly development having an adverse effect on the amenities of adjacent occupiers by way of overshadowing, outlook, sense of enclosure, and loss of privacy, contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD, the Residential Design SPD, the London Plan and the NPPF.",
    "The proposed development would result in poor living conditions that do not create a suitably high quality living environment for future occupiers. The constraints of the first floor bedrooms and design approach adopted would be to the detriment of the amenity of future occupiers. The proposed single and master bedroom in the three bedroom dwelling fail to meet the minimum area and minimum width, respectively, outlined in nationally described space standards and would provide cramped and awkward bedrooms with constrained ceiling heights. On this basis the design would result in substandard living conditions for future occupants, in direct contrast to the aims of London Plan Policy 3.5 and Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD.",
    "The proposal, if granted planning permission on appeal, would be liable for the Mayor of London and Havering Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). Based upon the information supplied with the application, the CIL payable would be Â£18,456 based on 123.04sqm of additional residential floor space. Further details with regard to CIL are available from the Council's website.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to the agent via email on 19/6/20."
