    "The proposed development by reason of the resultant scale, bulk and mass of the host property and design concept of the extensions proposed cumulatively would appear dominant and visually intrusive to the detriment of the character and appearance of the area and the proposal would be able to retain the distinctive 'A' frame appearance exacerbating its visual prominence and unbalancing the pair of semi-detached houses.  The dwelling would be out of character for the built form in this locality and adversely disrupt the established pattern of development.  The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policies 10, 7 and 26 of the Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 and also the NPPF which requires fundamentally that development add to the overall quality of the area whilst also establishing or maintaining a strong sense of place.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, it was necessary to issue a decision as close to the statutory timeframe as possible as opposed to seeking amendments which would have significantly delayed the application."
