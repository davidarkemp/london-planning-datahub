    "The proposal would, by reason of its layout on the plot provide unsatisfactory access to the detriment of amenity and contrary to Policy DC61 DC32 and DC34 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD.",
    "The access by way of its width length and sight distances is unsatisfactory for emergency purposes and would create an unsafe living environment for future occupiers and contrary to Policy 7.13 of the London Plan.",
    "The proposed development would, by reason of its position and proximity to neighbouring properties as well as the likely loss of existing mature and semi-mature trees, cause overlooking and loss of privacy, noise and disturbance from the carrying of daily life as well as traffic arriving manoeuvring on and leaving the site, which would have a serious and adverse effect on the living conditions of adjacent occupiers, contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD.",
    "In the absence of a legal agreement to secure contributions towards the demand for school places arising from the development, the proposal fails to satisfactorily mitigate the infrastructure impact of the development, contrary to the provisions of Policies DC29 and DC72 of the Development Control Policies DPD and Policy 8.2 of the London Plan.",
    "The proposed layout of the development would be inadequate resulting in substandard accommodation for future residents through lack of internal space and quality accommodation and contrary to Policies DC4 and DC61 of the London Borough of Havering LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD 2008, Policy 3.5 of the London Plan the DCLG Technical Housing Standards March 2015, and as amended, and the London Borough of Havering Residential Design SPD 2011.",
    "The proposed development does not provide for refuse or cycle storage facilities and therefore is in contravention of DC35 and DC36 of the Development Control Policies DPD and Policy 5.17 and 6.9 of the London Plan",
    "The proposal, if granted planning permission on appeal, would be liable for the Mayor of London Community  infrastructure Levy (CIL). Based upon the information supplied with the application, the CIL payable would be Â£4350  (subject to indexation). Further details with regard to CIL are available from the Council's website"
