  "description": "Retrospective application for C4 HMO for up to 6 people",
  "site_name": "65 Charlbury Crescent",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The original property had a gross internal floor area of less than 120sqm and therefore fails to meet the requirements of Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 Policy 8(i) and would therefore not be regarded as an appropriate for conversion as it would have a negative impact on the supply of family housing in the borough.",
    "The development by reason of its housing typology, the siting of the property and the nature of the use as a HMO with high prospective occupancy would result in significantly higher levels of comings / goings and intensive activity over and above that of a single dwelling house resulting in a detrimental impact to the amenity of adjoining residents from noise and disturbance associated. The development would therefore be contrary to Policies 8 and 34 of the Havering Local Plan 2016-2031.",
    "The proposals fail to make adequate provision for the amenity of all six occupants through low quality and proportion of communal space and failure to comply with the East London HMO Guidance through limited size of Bedroom 3 the proposals are thereby in conflict with the requirements of Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 Policy 8(vi) and 8(vii).",
    "The proposals fail to demonstrate adequate levels of off-street parking. The nature of the HMO use by unrelated occupants combined with the level of occupancy is considered likely to lead to increased vehicle ownership and overspill which would contribute unacceptably to existing levels of parking stress and limited on-street spaces within the locality to the detriment of the amenity of surrounding occupiers. The absence of any compelling evidence otherwise, such as a parking stress survey, means that it has not been demonstrated that there would not be conflict with Policy 8(iv), London Plan T6 and Para 116 of the Framework.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to the agent in writing 12-05-2025"
