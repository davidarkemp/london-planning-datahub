    "The proposed dwellings would appear as a cramped and constrained incongruous form of development, entirely out of character with the established pattern of development and architectural style in the local area, therefore harmful to local character, contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD.",
    "The proposed development would result in living conditions that do not create a suitably high quality living environment for future occupiers. The constrained width of the site in conjunction with the design approach adopted would be to the detriment of the amenity of future occupiers and is inconsistent with the pattern of development of the local area. The constrained internal and external spaces will result in a cramped living spaces including amenity space which would be substandard and give rise to an overwhelming sense of enclosure, in direct contrast to the aims of London Plan Policy 3.5 and Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to the agent via email.",
    "The proposal, if granted planning permission on appeal, would be liable for the Mayor of London Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and Havering CIL. Based upon the information supplied with the application, the CIL payable would be £9,800. Further details with regard to CIL are available from the Council's website.",
    "The proposal is liable to Mayoral CIL based on 56sqm of gross internal floor space created, calculated at £25.00 per square metre this would incur a liability of £1400.",
    "Havering Community Infrastructure Levy (HCIL) is charged at an approved rate of £125/sqm of gross internal area (GIA), therefore would generate a liability of £8,400."
