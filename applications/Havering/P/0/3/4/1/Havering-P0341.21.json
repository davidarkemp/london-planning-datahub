Future occupiers would need to enter the site from Boundary Road and access the rear of the building via an undercroft, which would be impractical, convoluted and would not adhere to Secured by Design principles, detrimental to future residential amenity and contrary to Policies DC3, DC61 and DC63 of the Local Development Framework Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document, the Residential Design Supplementary Planning Document and Policies D6 and D11 of the London Plan.",
    "The proposed building would, by reason of its form, scale, mass, lack of an active frontage and articulation, poor design, materiality and position close the front boundary of the site, appear incongruous, visually intrusive, unduly bulky and out of character in the streetscene harmful to the character and appearance of the surrounding area contrary to Policy DC61 of the Local Development Framework Core Strategy and Development Control Polices Development Plan Document and the guidance contained in the National Planning Policy Framework.",
    "In the absence of a legal agreement to secure £5,000 for the Council to implement the parking restrictions, the proposal is contrary to Policies DC32 and DC72 of the Local Development Framework Core Strategy and Development Control Polices Development Plan Document, Policy DF1 of the London Plan and the guidance contained in the National Planning Policy Framework.",
