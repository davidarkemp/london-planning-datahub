  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed development, due to its excessive depth and roof pitch height would present an unneighbourly visually intrusive development that is harmful to outlook from neighbouring residential properties and detrimental to neighbouring residential amenity, contrary to Policy DC61 of the London Borough of Havering LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD 2008.",
    "The proposed development would result in cramped living conditions that do not create a suitably high quality living environment for future occupiers. The constraints of the site in conjunction with the design approach adopted would be to the detriment of the amenity of future occupiers. The dwelling design fails to provide ample bedroom sizes and fails to provide the minimum built-in storage, in direct contrast to the aims of the NPPF, the London Plan Policy D6 and Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD.",
    "The submitted plans do not demonstrate adequate vehicular access to the site, as access from the public road is reliant on the adjoining parcel of land which does not form part of the application site or the red line site plan. Accordingly the proposal is unacceptable from an access arrangement in conflict with provisions of Policy DC33 and Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to the agent in email on 20/4/21.",
    "The proposal, if granted planning permission on appeal, would be liable for the Mayor of London Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and Havering CIL. Based upon the information supplied with the application, the CIL payable would be £225 and £1125. Further details with regard to CIL are available from the Council's website."
