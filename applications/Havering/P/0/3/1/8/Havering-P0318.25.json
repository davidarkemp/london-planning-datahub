    "The proposed development, by reason of its cramped nature within the plot, close proximity to the eastern boundary of the site, narrow plan form and lack of ground floor front projection would appear visually at odds with other dwellings within the existing terraced row of houses and thereby form a visually intrusive piece of development that together with the loss of part of the grass verge opposite the site would be detrimental to the character and appearance of the surrounding area and detract from the soft open vista of this corner of Northolt Way, contrary to Policies 7, 26 and 27 of the Havering Local Plan, Policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan and Paragraph 135(d) of the NPPF.",
    "The proposed development would, by reason of its limited storage space and the size and proximity of the rear amenity area to the pergola of donor property, result in a dwelling of low quality design that would be detrimental to future occupants, particularly through providing limited space for storage within the proposed dwelling, a small and cramped amenity area that would be insufficient for the occupants of a 3-bedroom dwelling and poor outlook and a sense of enclosure from both the dining room and rear garden areas of the proposed dwelling, contrary to the provisions of Policies D5 and D6 of the London Plan, Policies 7 and 10 of the Havering Local Plan and Paragraph 135(f) of the NPPF.",
    "The proposed development, by reason of the resultant size of the rear amenity area of the donor property, would be detrimental to the living conditions of the occupants of the donor dwelling through resulting in a small and cramped rear amenity space for this property that would be insufficient for the occupants of a 4-bedroom dwelling, contrary to the provisions of Policies D5 and D6 of the London Plan, Policies 7 and 10 of the Havering Local Plan and Paragraph 135(f) of the NPPF.",
    "Insufficient information has been submitted as part of the application for the ecological impacts of the proposed development to be assessed, contrary to Policies 10 and 30 of the Havering Local Plan, Policy G7 of the London Plan and paragraph 193(d) of the NPPF.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to the agent in writing 22/05/2025.",
