    "The modification sought to remove clause 3(b) of section 106 legal agreement for planning permission reference P0859.12 dated 13/11/2012 would remove the granny annex status of the building for use by dependent relatives of the occupants of the main dwelling (No. 3 Heath Close, Romford) as part of the same planning unit, sharing facilities including access, parking and amenity space and as such, would result in a separate detached dwelling unit which would be out character with the area and would have a substandard living accommodation for existing and future occupiers contrary policies 7 and 26 of Havering Local Plan 2021 and the National Planning Policy Framework which seeks to ensure a high standard of amenity for existing and future occupants of land and buildings. There is no other evidence to justify why clause 3 (b) should be removed over the passage of time.",
