    "The development to which this permission relates must be commenced not later than six months from the date of this permission.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To ensure the exiting unsightly structures are removed and replaced to reduce the impact of the development upon the oppeness of the green belt.",
    "The development hereby permitted shall not be carried out otherwise than in complete accordance with the approved plans (as set out on page one of this decision notice).",
    "Reason:-",
    "For the avoidance of doubt and to ensure that the development is carried out as approved.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35(2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management) Order 2015: No significant problems were identified during the consideration of the application, and therefore it has been determined in accordance with paragraph 38 of the National Planning Policy Framework.",
    "The applicant's attention is drawn to the fact that the existing boundary fence, Lamp post and CCTV Columns are unauthorised and have been found to have an adverse impact upon the openness of the Green Belt and rural character of the area. Hence it is essential that all works are carried out in accordance to time limit set out in condition 1. The evidence for the implementation of the scheme shall be submitted to the council within a month of the completion of the work. In the event that such evidence were not to be provided the Council would be likely to take appropriate action to remedy the breach of planning control."
