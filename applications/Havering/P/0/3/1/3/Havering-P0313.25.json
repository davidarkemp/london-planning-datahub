    "Reason: To ensure that the appearance of the proposed development will harmonise with the character of the surrounding area.",
    "Notwithstanding the provisions of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015, no window or other opening (other than those shown on the submitted and approved plans) shall be formed in the flank walls of the buildings hereby permitted, unless specific permission under the provisions of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 has first been sought and obtained in writing from the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:-",
    "In order to ensure a satisfactory development that will not result in any loss of privacy or damage to the environment of neighbouring properties which exist or may be proposed in the future.",
    "The works hereby permitted shall be carried out entirely in accordance with the Arboricultural Report and Method Statement for Tree Protection Measures authored by Andrew Day Arboricultural Consultancy Ltd dated 17 July 2024.",
    "Reason: In order to maintain the existing vegetation at the site, which makes an important contribution to the character of the area, and to accord with Policy 27 of the Council's Local Plan.",
    "During construction of the development hereby permitted, no trees located within or adjacent to the application site 60 Rush Green Road Romford RM7 0QB shall not be lopped or felled without the written consent of the local planning authority.",
