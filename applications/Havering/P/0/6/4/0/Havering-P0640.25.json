    "The proposed development, by reason of its bulk, scale and massing would, when viewed in the context of the smaller scale of the buildings in the immediate vicinity of the plot and the limited size of the plot in which it would be situated, appear as out of keeping with prevailing spacious character in the immediate locality and this part of Emerson Park, thereby having an adverse impact on the character and appearance of the street scene and Emerson Park Policy Area, contrary to Local Plan Policies 7, 26 and 28, the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document and the Emerson Park Policy Area Supplementary Planning Document.",
    "The proposed development, by reason of its height, bulk, scale, massing and position close to the shared boundary of the site with no. 1 Ernest Road, would form a dominant, visually intrusive and overbearing feature in relation to the rear garden environment of this neighbouring property which would have a serious and adverse effect on their living conditions, contrary to the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document and Local Plan Policy 7.",
    "The proposed development, through the provision of a first floor, rear dormers within the roof slope and projecting balcony as well as its orientation to no. 3 Ernest Road, would cause perceived and direct overlooking and a loss of privacy which would have a serious and adverse effect on the living conditions of these neighbouring occupiers, contrary to the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document and Local Plan Policy 7.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to the agent by e-mail on 25/07/2025."
