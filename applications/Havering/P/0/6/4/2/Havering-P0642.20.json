  "description": "Planning Application for the Erection of 3 x 2 Bedroom Dwellings",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed development would, by reason of its site constraints, in particular the relationship to the industrial site to the rear of the site,shallow north-facing rear garden; proximity to the rear boundary and limited separation distance from  the neighbouring industrial units  give rise to a cramped form of development which would materially harm the living conditions of future occupiers having particular regard to the provision of useable amenity space,  poor outlook and noise impact, which would be contrary to Policies DC51, DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD, the Residential Design SPD, Policy 7.4 of the London Plan and the NPPF 2019.",
    "The application fails to demonstrate that the proposal, having regard to the narrow access road, is able to make adequate provision for the servicing of the site, including adequate provision for refuse collection and access arrangements for emergency and rescue vehicles,  resulting in inadequate servicing arrangements contrary to Policy DC36 of the LDF Development Control Policies Development Plan Document.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to the agent in writing 25-09-2020.",
    "Please note also that should permission be granted by PINS if allowed on appeal following a refusal by London Borough of Havering will attract a liability payment of £37,350 plus indexation in Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) based on 249 square metres of additional floorspace.",
    "The Mayoral CIL levy rate for Havering is £25.00 per sqm and is chargeable for each additional square metre of  residential gross internal floorspace(GIA). Based upon the information supplied with the application, £6,225 would be payable with 249 sqm of  new GIA, however this may be adjusted subject to indexation.",
    "The proposal would also be liable for Havering Council's CIL. Havering's CIL charging rate for residential is £125.00 per sqm for each additional square metre of GIA in this location. Based upon the information supplied with the application, £31,125 would be payable, subject to indexation.",
    "These charges are levied under s.206 of the Planning Act 2008. CIL is payable within 60 days of commencemen"
