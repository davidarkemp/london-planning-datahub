    "In the absence of satisfactory information regarding the users, scale of the use, the staff, visitors, level of care required, including the property typology with no soundproofing details, it would be considered that the applicant has not demonstrated that proposed use would not lead to increased comings and goings to the site over and above the required level within a residential environment, resulting in a detrimental impact to the amenity of adjoining residents from noise and disturbance associated. The proposals would therefore be contrary to Policies 6 and 7 of the Havering Local Plan 2021. For the reasons given it is not considered that this could be overcome through a restrictive condition.",
    "The proposal fails to demonstrate that an adequate degree of visitor and carer parking facilities would be provided, would result in an increased pressure on on-street parking to the detriment of the safe and efficient operation of the highway and convenience of occupiers of neighbouring properties. In this respect, the proposal would be contrary to Policies 6 and 24 of the Local Plan as well as the objectives of the NPPF 2023.",
