    "The proposed development, by reason of its bulk and footprint, would result in disproportionate additions to the original house and garage over and above their original form and would result in material harm to the character and openness of the Green Belt.  No very special circumstances to justify such harm have been submitted. The proposal is therefore considered to be contrary to the provisions of the National Planning Policy Framework and Policy G2 of the London Plan.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, it was necessary to issue a decision as close to the statutory timeframe as possible as opposed to seeking amendments which would have significantly delayed the application."
