    "The proposed hip to gable roof conversion would alter the basic shape of the roof on the semi-detached property which is unacceptable as it leads to an imbalance between the pair and creates a visually heavy roof to one half causing a negative effect on the street scene by the loss of symmetry.  Accordingly the proposal is of a poor quality design which is contrary to the purposes and intent of Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document, the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document.",
    "The proposed rear dormer window, by reason of its bulk and massing would occupy an unacceptably large area of the rear roof slope,  forming a dominant, incongruous and visually intrusive feature, detrimental to the character and appearance of the property and materially harmful to the visual amenity of the surrounding area contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document and the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to the agent via email on 28/05/21.",
    "It should be noted that the incorrect property (No. 102 Gubbins Lane) is outlined in red on the drawings P210 and P211."
