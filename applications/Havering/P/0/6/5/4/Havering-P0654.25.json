    "The proposed first floor rear extension, by reason of its flat roof design and limited separation distances to adjoining properties, would result in an unacceptable form of development that fails to respect the established character of the area and the amenity of neighbouring occupiers, contrary to Policy 26 of the Havering Local Plan (adopted 2021) and the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document (2011).",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy a decision was made on the application, which will enable the applicant to exercise a right of appeal if they so wish."
