    "The proposed extension of operating hours would, by reason of its location and relationship to nearby sensitive receptors, result in an unsatisfactory relationship by way of noise and disturbance, which would be to the detriment of the amenity and living conditions of neighbouring occupiers. The proposal failed to provide adequate acoustic justification to demonstrate that residential amenity would not be adversely impacted. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies 7, 13, 14 and 34 of the Havering Local Plan, Policies D14 and HC6 of the London Plan and the National Planning Policy Framework.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to SA Maintenance via email on 25th July 2025."
