    "The site is within the Metropolitan Green Belt and the proposed development would not align fully with any of the exceptions set out in Section 13 of the NPPF and would therefore be comprised of inappropriate development. The proposed dwellings would through their design, arrangement and mass and use of the site form an unwanted urbanisation of the site which would have a profound and material impact on the openness of the Green Belt in this location and would conflict with the purposes of including land within it. In the absence of any Very Special Circumstances which would outweigh the harm of inappropriateness and harm to openness the proposed development is unacceptable in principle and in contrast to the objectives of the NPPF and Policy G2 of the London Plan 2021",
    "The proposed dwellings through their design concept, massing and arrangement on the site would be at odds with prevailing patterns of development and would not reflect the character of the existing site and wider surrounding area. The proposals would therefore be contrary to Policies 7 and 26 of the Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 and also Paragraph 135 of the NPPF which requires fundamentally that development add to the overall quality of the area whilst also establishing or maintaining a strong sense of place and be sympathetic to local character and history, including the surrounding built environment and landscape setting.",
    "The proposal fails to make provision for affordable housing and in the absence of any means to secure provision of affordable housing, such as through a legal agreement or any justification or mitigation measures to adequately justify the lack of on site provision the proposal is contrary to the provisions of Policy 4 of the havering Local Plan 2016-2031.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to the applicant in writing 12-07-2024",
    "The proposal, if granted planning permission on appeal, would be liable for the Havering Community infrastructure Levy (HCIL) and Mayoral Community Infrastructure Levy (MCIL). Based upon the information supplied with the application, the Levy payable are (subject to indexation).",
    "New floor area of 830 sqm offset by the demolition of approx 767 sqm of existing floor space.",
    "Havering CIL (125 per sqm) - £7875",
