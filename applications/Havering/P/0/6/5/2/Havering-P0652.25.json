    "- Together with other extensions, outbuildings etc, the decking or platforms cover no more than 50 per cent of the garden area.",
    "- None of the decking or platform is on land forward of a wall forming the principal elevation.",

    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: In accordance with paragraph 38 of the National Planning Policy Framework, improvements required to make the proposal acceptable were negotiated with Mr. Brown (Agent) by phone and e-mail.

The amendments were subsequently submitted on  23/05/25, 03/07/25 & 04/07/25.",
