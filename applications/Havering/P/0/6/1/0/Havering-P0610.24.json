This could include, but not necessarily limited to, the installation of a suitable gas resistant membrane, in compliance with BS 8485:2015+A1:2019, alternative gas protection measures, or suitable monitoring agreed in writing with the local planning authority, to demonstrate that the risk from landfill gas is adequately controlled.  Any gas protection measures shall be carried out in strict accordance with the agreed details.",
    "Upon completion of installation of any gas protection measures, a 'Verification Report' must be submitted demonstrating that the works have been carried out.",

This is an intrusive site investigation including factors such as chemical testing, quantitative risk assessment and a description of the sites ground conditions.  An updated Site Conceptual Model should be included showing all the potential pollutant linkages and an assessment of risk to identified receptors.",

The remediation strategy shall be implemented as approved.",

The revision included the improvement to landscaping to protect views from public vantage points.",
    "For any development where a flood risk is identified, the Council as the Lead Local Flood Authority want to see developers consider and implement flood resilience/resistance measures into the buildings themselves.
