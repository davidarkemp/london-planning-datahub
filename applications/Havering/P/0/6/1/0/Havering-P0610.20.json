  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed development would, by reason of its height, bulk, mass, design and proximity to common boundaries appear as an unacceptably dominant and overbearing development to the detriment of both adjoining neighbours at nos. 69 and 73 Farm Road and be a visually intrusive feature in the street scene harmful to the appearance of the surrounding area and character of the streetscape, which is contrary to the SPD, Policy DC61 and Policy DC69 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD.",
    "The proposal, if granted planning permission on appeal, would be liable for the Mayor of London Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and Havering CIL. The proposal includes the creation of an additional 117.42 square metres of additional gross internal area (GIA) of residential space. Mayoral CIL is charged at £25 per square metre resulting in £2935.50. Havering CIL is charged at £125 per square metre (for Residential development in Zone A - North), resulting in £14,677.50.",
    "Based upon the information supplied with the application, the total CIL payable would be £17,613.00. Further details with regard to CIL are available from the Council's website.",
    "It is noted that an exemption from CIL payments has been submitted with this application.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to Mr & Mrs  Rice, via email on 29 June 2020."
