    "The creation of three apartments within the rear garden of the host property would, by reason of their form and layout, including an excessive amount of hardstanding/accessway, appear incongruous in the rear garden environment and be materially harmful to the open and spacious local character of the surrounding area contrary to Policies DC61 and DC69 of the London Borough of Havering LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document 2008, the Hall Lane Policy Area Supplementary Planning Document 2009 and the guidance contained in the National Planning Policy Framework 2019.  The Hall Lane Policy Area Supplementary Planning Document 2009 states that existing long and well landscaped rear gardens to Hall Lane properties do contribute to the special character",
    "of the wider area, and therefore any frontage developments will be expected to have generous rear amenity space provision. This proposal would therefore be detrimental to this established character.",
    "By extending the access road with a ramp to the basement car park  would, by reason of its position, length and proximity to neighbouring properties, result in noise and disturbance harmful to the amenity of adjacent occupiers, including Hurstwood Court, contrary to Policy DC61 of the London Borough of Havering LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document 2008.",
    "In the absence of a legal agreement to secure contributions towards the demand for school places arising from the development, the proposal fails to satisfactorily mitigate the infrastructure impact of the development, contrary to the provisions of Policies DC29 and DC72 of the London Borough of Havering LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document 2008, and Policy 8.2 of the London Plan 2016.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reasons for it was given to Dovetail Architects Ltd via email on 11th June 2019.",
    "The proposal, if granted planning permission on appeal, would be liable for the Mayor of London Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). Based upon the information supplied with the application, the CIL payable would be Â£11,512.50. Further details with regard to CIL are available from the Council's website."
