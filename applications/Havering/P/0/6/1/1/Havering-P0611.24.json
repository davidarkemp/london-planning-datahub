    "Reason:-",
    "For the avoidance of doubt and to ensure that the development is carried out as approved.",
    "Notwithstanding the details submitted with the proposal hereby approved, prior to commencement of development a detailed schedule of the proposed external materials (including clear photographs/ drawings as appropriate), shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority. The development shall be implemented in accordance with the approved details.",
    "Reason: Insufficient information has been supplied with the application to judge the appropriateness of the extension proposed and its materiality. Submission of samples prior to commencement will safeguard the appearance of the building and the character of the immediate area, and will ensure that the development accords with Local Plan Policy 28.",
    "Prior to their installation on-site, additional drawings that show details of proposed new windows, doors, facia and sills to be used by section and elevation at scales between 1:20 and 1:1 as appropriate have been submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority. Works shall be implemented in accordance with the approved details and shall be permanently maintained as such.",
    "Reason: Insufficient information has been supplied with the application to judge the appropriateness of the extension proposed and its materiality. The submission of specific details prior to their installation on site will safeguard the appearance of the building and the character of the immediate area, and will ensure that the development accords with Local Plan Policy 28.",
    "Notwithstanding the provisions of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015, no window or other opening (other than those shown on the submitted and approved plan,) shall be formed in the flank wall(s) of the building(s) hereby permitted, unless specific permission under the provisions of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 has first been sought and obtained in writing from the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:-",
    "In order to ensure a satisfactory development that will not result in any loss of privacy or damage to the environment of neighbouring properties which exist or may be proposed in the future.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35(2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management) Order 2015: No significant problems were identified during the consideration of the application, and therefore it has been determined in accordance with paragraph 38 of the National Planning Policy Framework."
