    "The proposed first floor rear extension would, by reason of its positioning, height and proximity to the boundary with  no.58 Beltinge Way, Romford, be an intrusive, overbearing and unneighbourly development that would have a significant adverse effect on the amenities of these adjacent occupiers resulting in an increased sense of enclosure with an overbearing impact contrary to Policy 7 of the Havering Local Plan and the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document.",
