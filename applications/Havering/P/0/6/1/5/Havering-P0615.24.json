    "The development to which this permission relates must be commenced not later than three years from the date of this permission.",
    "Reason:- To comply with the requirements of Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended by Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004).",

Submission of samples prior to the commencement of above ground works will ensure that the appearance of the proposed development will harmonise with the character of the surrounding area.",

    "No above ground works shall take place in relation to the development hereby approved until details of all proposed walls, fences and boundary treatment shall be submitted to, and approved in writing by, the Local Planning Authority.  The boundary development shall then be carried out in accordance with the approved details and retained permanently thereafter to the satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason: Insufficient information has been supplied with the application to judge the appropriateness of any boundary treatment.  Submission of this detail prior to commencement will protect the visual amenities of the development and prevent undue overlooking of adjoining property.",
    "The proposed first floor flank windows of both proposed dwellings that would serve a bathroom, as shown on drawing '0143_00_120 (Revision: 04)' accompanying the application, shall be permanently glazed with obscure glass not less than level 3 on the standard scale of obscurity and shall thereafter be maintained and permanently fixed shut and thereafter maintained with the exception of any top hung fanlight(s).",

    "Reason:- In order to ensure no water run-off from the hard surface which would contribute to risk of flooding.",
    "All off street residential car parking spaces must provide infrastructure for electric or Ultra-Low Emission vehicles. At least 1 space shall have active charging facilities, with passive provision for all remaining spaces.",
    "Reason:- To minimise the impact of transport emissions on local air quality.",
    "No demolition or construction works, or deliveries, into the site shall take place other than between the hours of 08.00 to 18.00 on Monday to Friday and 08.00 to 13.00 hours on Saturdays unless agreed in writing with the local planning authority.
