    "All new external finishes shall be carried out in materials to match those of the existing building(s) to the satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:-",

    "The extension hereby permitted shall be used only for living accommodation as an integral part of the existing dwelling known as 1 Cloister Close, Rainham and shall not be used as a separate unit of residential accommodation at any time.",

    "Reason:-",
    "In the interests of the amenity of the occupiers of neighbouring dwelling.",
    "Before the building(s) hereby permitted is first occupied, the area set aside for car parking shall be laid out and surfaced to the satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority and retained permanently thereafter for the accommodation of vehicles visiting the site and shall not be used for any other purpose.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To ensure that car parking accommodation is made permanently available to the standards adopted by the Local Planning Authority in the interest of highway safety.",
