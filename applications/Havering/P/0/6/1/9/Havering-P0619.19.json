    "The proposed residential accommodation, by reason of both the internal layout and functionality, would create a poor quality living environment for future occupiers through poor rear outlook from the main living rooms, inter-looking, loss of privacy, noise and disturbance. As a result the proposal would not provide acceptable living conditions for all of the future occupants, to the detriment of residential amenity and contrary to Policy DC61 of the Local Development Framework Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document.",
    "The proposed additional storey fails to sufficiently take account of the art deco design of the existing building and would appear incongruous and out of character in the street scene, contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to Pegasus Group via email on 18th July 2019.",
    "The proposal, if granted planning permission on appeal, would be liable for the Mayor of London Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). Based upon the information supplied with the application, the CIL payable would be Â£2,600. Further details with regard to CIL are available from the Council's website."
