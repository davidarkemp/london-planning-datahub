    "The proposed restaurant (Class A3) use would give rise to an unacceptable concentration/grouping of non-retail uses within the relevant frontage, thereby harming the character and function of the area and undermining the vitality and viability of the Gidea Park Major Local Centre. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy DC16 of the Local Development Framework Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document.",
    "The proposed development would, by reason of the inadequate on site car parking provision, result in unacceptable overspill onto the adjoining roads to the detriment of highway safety and residential amenity and contrary to Policies DC32 and DC33 of the Development Control Policies Development Plan Document.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to the agent via email on 15 July 2020."
