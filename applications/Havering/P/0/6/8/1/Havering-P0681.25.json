    "Reason:-",
    "This restriction is to further comply with policies 19 and 20 of the Local Plan 2021. Applications for alternative uses would be considered on their individual merits.",
    "Notwithstanding the details shown on the approved plans, the development hereby approved shall not be occupied until the 6 car parking spaces and 3 loading bays in accordance with plan no. 202 Rev A, have been provided on site, the new parking shall be laid out, surfaced and drained, and shall be retained as such thereafter.",
    "Reason:-",
