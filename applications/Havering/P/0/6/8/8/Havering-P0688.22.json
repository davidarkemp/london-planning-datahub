As a result, the development represents an overdevelopment of the site contrary to Policy 7 of the Havering Local Plan and Policy D6 of the London Plan.",
    "The communal amenity space for the proposed flats is of poor quality, quantity and accessibility and combined with the site layout, would result in undue overlooking and loss of privacy to the ground floor flat, No. 82, harmful to the amenity of future occupiers contrary to Policy 7 of the Havering Local Plan and Policy D6 of the London Plan.",

This charge has been levied under s.206 of the Planning Act 2008 and includes both the Mayor of London's CIL and Havering Council's CIL.",
