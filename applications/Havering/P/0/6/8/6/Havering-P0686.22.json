    "The proposed additional front dormer window, by reason of its width, position and bulk, as well as its flat roof design would occupy an unacceptably area of the front roof slope, forming a dominant and visually intrusive feature, detrimental to the character and appearance of the property and materially harmful to the visual amenity of the surrounding area contrary to the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document, Policies D1, D3 and D4 of The London Plan (2021) and Policy 26 of the Local Plan.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, it was necessary to issue a decision as close to the statutory timeframe as possible as opposed to seeking amendments which would have significantly delayed the application.",
    "The applicant is informed that the hip to gable works and rear dormer shown as approved on the submitted drawings need to be completed in their entirety as per Certificate of Lawfulness ref: D0073.22. Otherwise the Certificate decision will not be lawful i.e. would cease to apply and would require planning permission which is less likely to be supported."
