    "The proposed front and rear dormers would, by reason of their detailed design, height, position and excessive bulk appear out of scale and character with the dwellings and materially harmful to the visual amenity of the surrounding area contrary to Local Plan policy 26, and the design guidance within the Councils Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD.",
    "The proposed 3B5P dwelling House A (91sqm) would fall below the minimum internal floor space of 99sqm required to comply with table 3.1 of the London Plan and therefore would fail to provide an acceptable standard of accommodation for future occupiers of this unit contrary to Local Plan policy 7 and London Plan policy D6.",
    "The proposal has failed to demonstrate that the proposed vehicular parking area within the front boundary of House A, due to its shallow depth would not increase road danger as parked vehicles would overhang the public highway and lead to pedestrian vehicle conflict which would be exacerbated given the proximity to the on-street parking bays located near front of the site. The proposal is therefore contrary to contrary to Local Plan policies 23 and 24 and London Plan policies T2 and T4.",
    "In the absence of a legal agreement to secure the development as car permit free to restrict eligibility of future occupiers from obtaining on-street residential parking permits, the proposals fail to promote sustainable travel and reduce car dominance and act as a discouragement to using public transport. The proposals are contrary to Local Plan Policies 23 and 24 and London Plan (2021) policies T2, T6 and T6.1.",
    "In the event that this application is allowed through the appeals process the proposals would be liable for the following CIL contributions:",
    "The proposed development would change the use of an existing building to residential and also construct 1 new residential unit with 111sqm of new gross internal floorspace. The proposal is liable for LB Havering CIL and will incur a charge of Â£13,875 (subject to indexation) based on the calculation of Â£125.00 per square metre. The proposal is also liable for Mayoral CIL and will incur a charge of Â£2,775 (subject to indexation) based on the calculation of Â£25.00 per square metre.",
