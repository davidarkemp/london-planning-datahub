It would represent a materially intrusive and overbearing form of development which reduces the availability of light and outlook therefore being materially harmful to the amenity of No. 62 Hyland Close contrary to Policies 7 and 26 of the Local Plan and the Council's Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD.",
