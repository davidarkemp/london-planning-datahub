    "The proposed single storey rear extensions would, by reason of its excessive depth, height and close proximity to the western shared boundary, be unneighbourly which would give rise to an uncomfortable and overbearing effect resulting in an increased sense of enclosure and loss of outlook to the amenity of the occupiers of no. 51 Larchwood Avenue contrary to Policy DC61 of the London Borough of Havering LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD 2008, and the London Borough of Havering Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD 2011.",
