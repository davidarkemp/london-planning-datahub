    "The proposed rear extension, by reason of its height, bulk and mass, in particular the excessive width of the first floor rear extension, would not appear suitably subservient to the scale of the existing dwelling. Given the proximity to the boundary with adjacent neighbours the rear extension would be an unacceptably dominant and visually intrusive feature in relation to the host dwelling and within the context of the rear garden environments of neighbours, having an overbearing, dominant and intrusive impact on occupiers of neighbouring property, in particular no. 16 Dover Close.  As such, the extensions would be harmful to the appearance of the both the host dwelling and the surrounding area while being detrimental to the amenity of neighbours contrary to Policies 7 and 26 of the Havering Local Plan and the Council's Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD.",
    "In the absence of further details confirming otherwise the proposed dormer would, by reason of its bulk, mass and positioning along the common boundary with the attached neighbour appear out of scale and character with the existing roof. It would appear overly dominate in the context of the roof and materially harmful to the character of the host dwelling and surrounds while being detrimental to the amenity of neighbours contrary to Policies 7 and 26 of the Havering Local Plan and the Council's Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD.",
