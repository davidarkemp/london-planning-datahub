  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed development would by virtue of its scale and bulk and the incompatible and insubordinate design of the flat roofed rear element of the extension appear as incongruous, dominant and visually intrusive form of development, which is harmful to the streetscene and rear garden environment, contrary to Policy DC61 of the London Borough of Havering LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD 2008, and the London Borough of Havering Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD 2011.",
    "The proposed development would, by reason of its excessive scale, height and bulk and its relationship close to the neighbouring detached dwelling at No. 7 Abbey Wood Lane, be unneighbourly which would give rise to an uncomfortable overbearing effect resulting in an increased sense of enclosure and loss of outlook and be harmful to the amenity of No. 7 Abbey Wood Lane contrary to Policy DC61 of the London Borough of Havering LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD 2008, and the London Borough of Havering Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD 2011.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to the agent Mark Fage by e-mail on 14/07/2020."
