    "The proposed dwelling through its design, mass and site layout would form an incongruous and visually cramped form of development at odds with surrounding character in an environment more familiar with subordinate outbuildings. The proposals would therefore be contrary to Policies 10, 7 and 26 of the Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 and also Paragraph 130(a) of the NPPF which requires fundamentally that development add to the overall quality of the area whilst also establishing or maintaining a strong sense of place.",
    "The proposed dwelling would form a visually intrusive and overbearing feature from adjacent rear gardens detrimental to neighbouring amenity and therefore contrary to Policies 10, 7 and 26 of the Havering Local Plan 2016-2031. There would also be conflict with paragraph 130 of the National Planning Policy Framework which seeks to ensure a high standard of amenity for existing and future occupiers.",
    "The proposed layout of the development would be inadequate resulting in substandard accommodation for future residents through lack of internal space. As a result, the development represents an overdevelopment of the site contrary to Policy 7 of the Havering Local Plan and Policy D6 of the London Plan.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to the agent in writing 05-07-2022.",
    "For Residential Development Only",
    "Please be advised that approval of this application from 1st September 2019 (either by London Borough of Havering, or subsequently by PINS if allowed on appeal following a refusal by London Borough of Havering) will attract a liability payment of £18,900 plus indexation in Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This charge has been levied under s.206 of the Planning Act 2008 and includes both the Mayor of London's CIL and Havering Council's CIL.",
    "London Borough of Havering, as CIL collecting authority, has responsibility for the collection of the Mayoral CIL, in addition to Havering's CIL, on commencement of the development.",
    "Your proposal is subject to a CIL Liability Notice indicating a levy of £18,900 plus indexation for the application, based on the Mayoral CIL levy rate for Havering of £25/sq.m plus Havering's charging rate for residential of £125/sq.m (Zone A), and the floorspace of 126 square metres.",
