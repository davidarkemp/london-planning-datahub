    "The proposed side and roof extensions would, by reason of their excessive height and position close to the boundaries of the site, be an intrusive and unneighbourly development as well as having an adverse effect on the amenities of adjacent occupiers contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD.",
    "The site is within the area identified in the Local Development Framework as Green Belt. Policy DC45 of the LDF and Government Guidance as set out in the National Planning Policy Framework (Green Belts) states that in order to achieve the purposes of the Green Belt it is essential to retain and protect the existing rural character of the area so allocated and that new development will only be permitted outside the existing built up areas in the most exceptional circumstances. The development is inappropriate in principle in the Green Belt and no very special circumstances have been submitted in this case to outweigh the harm caused by reason of inappropriateness and visual harm to the character and openness of the Green Belt. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy DC45 of the Local Development Framework Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document, Policy G2 of the London Plan 2021 and the National Planning Policy Framework.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reasons for it was given to the agent via email in June 2021."
