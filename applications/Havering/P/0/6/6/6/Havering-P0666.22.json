    "The proposed developments would, by reason of the cumulative impact of their bulk, mass, height and proximity to the neighbouring boundary with no. 52 Courtenay Gardens, appear over-dominant in the rear garden scene and be an intrusive and overbearing form of development in relation to this neighbour, resulting in an adverse impact on the living conditions of adjacent occupiers, contrary to Local Plan Policies 7 and 26.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Improvements to the proposal involving the inclusion of privacy screens and two amerlanchier lamarckii trees were negotiated as part of the scheme. However, the resultant bulk, mass and height of the proposals were considered at detailed assessment stage to still be unacceptable. Further significant alteration would have been required to bring the development within the realms of acceptability so it was decided to proceed to determine the application."
