    "The proposed single storey rear extension would, by reason of its excessive height and position close to the boundaries of the site, be an intrusive, overbearing and unneighbourly development as well as having an adverse effect on the amenities of adjacent occupiers with No. 209 Collier Row Lane, Romford contrary to Policy 7 of the Havering Local Plan and Havering's Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to Mr S Owen via e-mail on 23/07/25."
