    "The proposed development, by reason of its bulk, scale, mass and proximity to the non-attached boundary, would result in the unbalancing of the semi-detached pair of properties and contribute to the enclosure of the characteristic gap between the host dwelling and its detached neighbour, resulting in a terracing effect. Accordingly, the proposal would be of a poor design quality and result in a loss of local distinctive character and harm the character and appearance of the pair of dwellings and the streetscape, contrary to Local Plan Policies 7 and 26, Policy D4 of the London Plan and the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Improvements to the proposal to reduce the bulk of the proposal at first floor level were negotiated with the agent during the course of the application. However, the design of the extension was considered at detailed assessment stage to still be unacceptable. Further significant alteration would have been required to bring the development within the realms of acceptability so it was decided to proceed to determine the application."
