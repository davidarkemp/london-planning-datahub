  "description": "Proposed first floor extension to house and new access into site.",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The site is within the area identified as Metropolitan Green Belt. The Local Development Framework and Government Guidance as set out in the NPPF is that in order to achieve the purposes of the Metropolitan Green Belt it is essential to retain and protect the existing open character of the area so allocated and that the new buildings will only be permitted in certain circumstances.The proposed first floor extension would result in disproportionate addition to the property over and above its original form and would also by way of the overall bulk and amount of development, be disproportionate and reduce and therefore cause harm to the openness of the Green Belt. No special circumstances have been submitted in this case. The development proposals are therefore contrary to Policy DC45 of the London Borough of Havering LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document 2008 and the provisions of the National Planning Policy Framework 2019.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to Mr Hubbarde (agent) by e-mail on 06-08-20."
