    "The formation of a self-contained dwelling and associated curtilage as shown would be detrimental to the street-scene through the formation of a conspicuously narrow dwelling at odds with the surrounding environment and patterns of development, whilst also resulting in a proposed plot size which would be spatially cramped and at odds with prevailing plot sizes in the vicinity of the development to the detriment of established local character. The proposals are considered to be contrary to Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 Policies 9 and 26, as well as the NPPF which requires fundamentally at Para 130 that development add to the overall quality of the area and maintain a strong sense of place.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to the agent in writing 20-06-2022.",
    "The proposal, if granted planning permission on appeal, would be liable for the Mayor of London and Havering Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). Based upon the information supplied with the application, the Mayoral CIL payable would be £1450 based on the calculation of £25.00 per square metre and the Havering Community Infrastructure Levy (HCIL) would be a charge of £7250 based on calculation of £125 per square metre. Each would be subject to indexation.",
    "Further details with regard to CIL are available from the Council's website."
