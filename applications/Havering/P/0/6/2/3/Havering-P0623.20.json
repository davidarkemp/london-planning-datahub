    "The proposed development would, by reason of its excessive height, depth, bulk and position close to the boundaries of the site, be an intrusive and unneighbourly development as well as having an adverse effect on the amenities of adjacent occupiers contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD and the relevant polices of the London Plan and NPPF.",
    "The proposed development would, by reason of the combined bulk, scale, height, size, design and proximity to boundaries, would result in an overbearing development that would be incongruous within the rear garden scene and street scene of The Woodfines and not be in keeping with the character and context of the existing dwelling and those surrounding it, contrary to the Emerson Park Policy Area Supplementary Planning Document, the Residential Extension and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document 2011 and Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD.",
    "The proposal will result in loss of trees with certain degree of amenity values without an acceptable provision for any replacement. This is contrary to policy ENV1 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD.",
    "The proposal, if granted planning permission on appeal, would be liable for the Mayor of London Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and Havering CIL. The proposal includes the creation of an additional 164.31 square metres of additional gross internal area (GIA) of residential space. Mayoral CIL is charged at £25 per square metre resulting in £4,107.75. Havering CIL is charged at £125 per square metre (for Residential development in Zone A - North), resulting in £20,538.75.",
    "Based upon the information supplied with the application, the total CIL payable would be £24,646.50. Further details with regard to CIL are available from the Council's website.",
    "No CIL forms have been submitted with this application and no CIL exemption has been applied for.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to Tony Pearce (agent) via email on 01/07/2020."
