    "The proposed development would, by reason of its size, scale, position and proximity to neighbouring properties be an intrusive and overbearing development, which would have a serious and adverse effect on the living conditions of adjacent occupiers, contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD.",
    "The proposed development would, by reason of its size, scale and reduced plot size create development which would appear uncharacteristically cramped on the site which would have serious and adverse effects on the appearance and character of the streetscene contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to the applicant's agent via email on 15 July 2019.",
    "The proposal, if granted planning permission on appeal, would be liable for the Mayor of London Community Infrastructure Levy (MCIL) and Havering CIL (HCIL). Based upon the information supplied with the application, the Mayoral CIL payable would be £2,225.00 and the Havering CIL £11,125.00, or a total liability of £13,250, both amounts subject to indexation.",
    "Further details with regard to CIL are available from the Council's website."
