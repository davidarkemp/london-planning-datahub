    "The proposed development would, by reason of its scale, bulk and mass, design and prominent siting and position close to the boundaries of the site, appear incongruous, visually intrusive, unduly cramped and out of character with the prevailing pattern of development, detrimental to the visual amenity of the locality and the street scene and rear garden environment contrary to Policy 26 of the Havering Local Plan, Policy D4 of the London Plan and the guidance contained in the National Planning Policy Framework.",
    "The proposed development, by reason of its excessive depth and position on the shared boundary would be an intrusive and unneighbourly development resulting in an overbearing impact, a significant loss of outlook and light and an increased sense of enclosure to the detriment of the amenities of adjacent occupiers at the neighbouring flat at No.151 Avon Road and No. 251 Front Lane, Upminster contrary to Policies 7 and 26 of the Havering Local Plan, Policy D4 of the London Plan and Paragraph 130 of the NPPF.",
    "The proposed flats by reason of lack of private amenity space would result in a substandard accommodation for future residents, contrary to Policy 7 of the Havering Local Plan, Policy D6 of the London Plan and Paragraph 130 of the NPPF.",
    "The proposed development would, by reason of the proposed car parking spaces, compromise the operation and function of the rear access road off Front Lane, and be prejudicial to highway and pedestrian safety contrary to Policy 24 of the Havering Local Plan and Policy T6 of the London Plan.",
