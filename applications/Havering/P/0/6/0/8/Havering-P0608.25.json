    "The proposed development would, by reason of its poor design, height, bulk and mass, appear as an unacceptably dominant and visually intrusive feature in the streetscene on this prominent corner site, thereby having an adverse impact on the visual amenity of the surrounding area contrary to Policy 7 and 26 of the Havering Local Plan.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, it was necessary to issue a decision as close to the statutory timeframe as possible as opposed to seeking amendments which would have significantly delayed the application.",
    "It is noted that the driveway and the front porch are likely to require planning permission as they do not meet permitted development limitations.  In order to regularise these additions, a planning application is required",
    "You are also informed that there are significant inaccuracies in the drawings both in respect to the existing elevation (windows position with respect to roof level) and with respect to the proposal, which means that it would not be possible to ascertain that the proposed alterations would be actually practicably achievable."
