    "The proposed development would, by reason of its height, bulk and mass appear as an unacceptably dominant and visually intrusive feature in the streetscene harmful to the character and appearance of the surrounding area contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD.",
    "The proposed development, by virtue of its siting, scale, design and appearance would result in a loss of openness to the Green Belt which fails to assist with its essential characteristics. As such the proposal represents inappropriate development within the Green Belt. The Local Planning Authority considers that very special circumstances do not exist to outweigh the harm to the Green Belt and the other harm identified. The proposal therefore fails to comply with Policy DC45 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document 2009 and the provisions of the National Planning Policy Framework 2019.",
    "The proposal, if granted planning permission on appeal, would be liable for the Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). Based upon the information supplied with the application, the CIL payable would be Â£24,900.00. Further details with regard to CIL are available from the Council's website.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: In accordance with paragraph 38 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2019, further details in terms of floor plans and the actual location of the garage were negotiated with the agent via email on 08 July 2020.  Details requested were not provided, instead applicant requested an extension of time for decision, however given the policy objection to the proposal, the request was not considered."
