    "The site is within the area identified in the Local Development Framework as Metropolitan Green Belt. The National Planning Policy Framework (Green Belts) states that in order to achieve the purposes of the Metropolitan Green Belt it is essential to retain and protect the openness of the so allocated and that new development will only be permitted outside the existing built up areas in the most exceptional circumstances. The proposal by reason of the introduction of new housing with a significant physical presence  would amount to a substantial incursion into the Green Belt. The  proposal would introduce an urban character which would significantly harm openness and would be materially harmful to the character and appearance of the Green Belt. The development is inappropriate in principle in the Green Belt and it is considered that no very special circumstances have been submitted in this case to outweigh the harm caused by reason of inappropriateness and visual harm to the character a",
    "Insufficient information has been provided to assess the impact on ecology and biodiversity on this site as well as the impact on trees and a TPO tree.  Given the outline nature of the proposals, with all matters reserved, in the absence of such information it is considered that the proposal may have a significant adverse impact upon the ecology and biodiversity of the site as well as arboricultural implications contrary to Policy 30 of the Havering Local Plan.",
    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate that the proposed development would be capable of providing adequate parking and servicing facilities or adequate space for the turning of emergency vehicles within the site, contrary to Policies 23 & 24 of the Havering Local Plan 2016-2031.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, it was necessary to issue a decision as close to the statutory timeframe as possible as opposed to seeking amendments which would have significantly delayed the application.",
    "The proposal, if granted planning permission on appeal, would be liable for the Mayor of London and Havering Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). Based upon the information supplied with the application, the Mayoral CIL payable would be £4550 based on the calculation of 25.00 per square metre and the Havering Community Infrastructure Levy (HCIL) would be  £22,750 based on calculation of £125 per square metre. Each would be subject to indexation.",
    "Further details with regard to CIL are available from the Council's website."
