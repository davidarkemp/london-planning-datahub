    "The development to which this permission relates must be commenced not later than three years from the date of this permission.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To comply with the requirements of Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended by Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004).",
    "The development hereby permitted shall not be carried out otherwise than in complete accordance with the approved plans (as set out on page one of this decision notice).",
    "Reason:-",
    "For the avoidance of doubt and to ensure that the development is carried out as approved.",
    "No building shall be occupied or use commenced until cycle storage is provided in accordance with details previously submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority. The cycle storage shall be permanently retained thereafter.",
    "Reason:-",
    "Insufficient information has been supplied with the application to demonstrate what facilities will be available for cycle parking.  Submission of this detail prior to occupation in the case of new building works or prior to the use commencing in the case of changes of use is in the interests of providing a wide range of facilities for non-motor car residents and sustainability and to ensure compliance with Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 Policy 24",
    "No building shall be occupied or use commenced until refuse and recycling facilities are provided in accordance with details which shall previously have been submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority. Provision shall be made for the storage of commercial waste and general waste within the premises ahead of collection and at no time shall any waste in association with the business use hereby permitted be stored outside of the premises.",
    "Reason:-",
    "Insufficient information has been supplied with the application to judge how refuse and recycling will be managed on site.  Submission of this detail prior to occupation in the case of new building works or prior to the use commencing in the case of changes of use will protect the amenity of occupiers of the development and also the locality generally and ensure that the development accords with Policies 26 and 35 of the Havering Local Plan 2016-2031",
    "Prior to the uses hereby permitted commencing a scheme for any new plant or machinery shall be submitted to the local planning authority to achieve the following standard. Noise levels expressed as the equivalent continuous sound level LAeq (1 hour) when calculated at the boundary with the nearest noise sensitive premises shall not exceed LA90 -10dB and shall be maintained thereafter to the satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:  To prevent noise nuisance to adjoining/adjacent properties.",
    "The building and uses hereby permitted shall only be used as a laundry warehouse (B2 - unit 4 only) and storage (B8 units 1-3) in the manner shown on the approved drawings 18/793/006  and not for any other use including those which might fall within Class B2 of the Town and Country Planning (Use Classes) Order 1987 (as amended) or in the case of the B8 uses any other change of use unless otherwise agreed in writing with the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:-",
    "In the interests of amenity and in accordance with Policies 7, 26 and 34 of the Havering Local Plan 2016-2031.",
    "No storage of plant, materials or any paraphernalia assocaited with the business uses hereby permitted shall take place in the open air and access to and from the site must be kept clear at all times.",
    "Reason:-",
    "In the interests of amenity and to accord with Policy 26 of the Havering Local Plan 2016-2031.",
    "No deliveries or collections shall be dispatched or received from the site other than between the hours of 08:00 to 18:00 Monday to Friday, unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To enable the Local Planning Authority to retain control in the interests of amenity, and in order that the development accords with Policies 7, 26 and 34 of the Havering Local Plan 2016-2031.",
    "The premises shall not be used for the purposes hereby permitted other than between the hours of 08:00 and 18:00 hours on Monday to Friday, and not at all on Saturdays, Sundays, Bank or Public Holidays without the prior consent in writing of the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:-",
