    "The proposed development by reason of its excessive width, bulk and siting would lead to overdevelopment of the site and would form a disproportionate addition that would unbalance the existing character of the house. The development would also reduce the open characteristic gap between the detached houses and would represent an incongruous, cramped addition. The proposal would represent an intrusive form of development causing unacceptable harm to the street scene, contrary to Policies CP17, DC61 and DC69 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD (2008), along with the Residential Extensions and Alteration and Hall Lane Policy Area Supplementary Planning Documents.",
