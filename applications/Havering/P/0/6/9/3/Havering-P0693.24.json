    "The applicant has not demonstrated that the development by virtue of its use and scale including proposed occupancy and operation would not be at odds with the suburban nature of its surroundings and would not result in undue harm to the residential amenity of neighbouring occupiers through comings and goings, turnover of staff and residents. The proposals would therefore be contrary to Policies 6, 7, 24, and 34 of the Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 and Policies H12 of the London Plan as well as the objectives of the NPPF.",
    "The site is not well served by public transport. The applicant has not demonstrated that proposed use would not lead to increased comings and goings to the site over and above that of a single dwelling house and that an adequate degree of visitor and carer parking facilities would be provided. Therefore as a consequence this would result in an adverse impact on the safety and convenience of the local highway network through exacerbating pedestrian-vehicular conflict along pavements and traffic congestion within the area. As such there would be conflict with Policy 6 of the Havering Local Plan 2016-2031, Policy T6 of the London Plan as well as the objectives of the NPPF.",
    "Bedroom 3 would not be of a sufficient size for the intended occupant. The applicant has therefore not demonstrated that the property would be suitable for the intended occupiers in terms of the standard of facilities and the level of independence and there would then be conflict with Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 Policy 6(v)",
