    "The proposed roof alteration including the crowned roof and dormer windows, by reason of its excessive scale, bulk, mass and top heavy appearance would appear as an unacceptably dominant and visually intrusive feature in the street scene and rear garden environment harmful to the appearance of the surrounding area contrary to Policy 26 of the Havering Local Plan, D4 of the London Plan, Emerson Park Policy Area and the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Documents.",
    "The proposed development would, by reason of its position and proximity to neighbouring properties cause overlooking and loss of privacy which would have a serious and adverse effect on the living conditions of adjacent occupiers, contrary to Policy 7 of the Havering Local Plan and Havering's Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document.",
    "The proposed development by reason of its excessive scale, bulk and position close to the boundary of the site would appear dominant as well as being an intrusive and un-neighbourly development, which would have an adverse effect on the amenity of adjacent neighbours including a loss of outlook contrary to the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document and Policies 7 and 26 of the Local Plan.",

    "Please be advised that approval of this application from 1st September 2019 (either by London Borough of Havering, or subsequently by PINS if allowed on appeal following a refusal by London Borough of Havering) will attract a liability payment of £19,650 plus indexation in Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This charge has been levied under s.206 of the Planning Act 2008 and includes both the Mayor of London's CIL and Havering Council's CIL.",
    "London Borough of Havering, as CIL collecting authority, has responsibility for the collection of the Mayoral CIL, in addition to Havering's CIL, on commencement of the development.",
    "Your proposal is subject to a CIL Liability Notice indicating a levy of £19,650 plus indexation for the application, based on the Mayoral CIL levy rate for Havering of £25/sq.m plus Havering's charging rate for residential of £125/sq.m (Zone A) and the floorspace of 131 square metres.",
