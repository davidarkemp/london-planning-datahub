    "The proposed first floor rear extension would, by reason of its height and position close to the boundaries of the site, be an intrusive and unneighbourly development as well as having an adverse effect on the amenities of adjacent occupiers at No.246 Corbets Tey Road, Upminster contrary to Policies 7 and 26 of the Havering Local Plan and the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: In accordance with paragraph 38 of the National Planning Policy Framework, improvements required to make the proposal acceptable were negotiated with Mr Ellis (Agent) by phone and e-mail.  The revisions involved reducing depth of front and rear extensions.  The applicant declined to make the suggested revisions."
