    "The proposed garage roof alteration and infill extension would, by reason of its excessive width, scale, height and position close to the boundary of the site, be an intrusive development, having an adverse effect on the streetscene, contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document and the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document.",
    "The proposals, by reason of the excessive width, scale and height of the infill extensions and the resultant bulk and mass of the extended and raised garage roof, together with the combined bulk and mass of the proposed rear conservatory, would result in development of excessive scale and bulk, giving rise to an unsympathetic, visually intrusive development which would not preserve or enhance the special character of this part of the Gidea Park Conservation Area contrary to the NPPF 2019, Core Strategy Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policies DC61 and DC68 and the Heritage Supplementary Planning Document.",
