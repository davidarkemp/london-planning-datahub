  "description": "A new detached bungalow to the rear of 13 Lambs Lane South to accommodate one-bedroom dwelling with amenity space, car and cycle parking.",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed development would provide a poor standard of amenity for future occupiers, providing poor levels of outlook and privacy contrary to Policy D6 of the London Plan.",
    "The proposed development would appear poorly designed, out of character and contrived within the plot, detracting from the character of the streetscene and disrupting the visual amenity of the locality contrary to Policy 26 of the Havering Local Plan.",
    "The proposed development would provide poor pedestrian visibility when navigating to and from the proposed parking space to the detriment of pedestrian safety contrary to Policy 24 of the Havering Local Plan.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to the Agent via email on 10th Feb 2023.",
