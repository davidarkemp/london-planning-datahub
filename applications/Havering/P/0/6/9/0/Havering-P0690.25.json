    "The proposed side extension, by virtue of its excessive width and disproportionate scale in comparison to the host property, would result in a visually dominant and incongruous addition that fails to respect the architectural character of the original dwelling, leading to an adverse impact on the street scene and surrounding area. And would undermine the principles of good design set out in SPD, local and national planning policies, notably the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document, Local Plan Policy 26 and Paragraph 130 of the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF 2024), which seek to ensure developments are sympathetic to local character and visually attractive.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, it was necessary to issue a decision as close to the statutory timeframe as possible as opposed to seeking amendments which would have significantly delayed the application."
