    "The proposed rear projection by reason of its glazing on the side elevations would lead to an unacceptable loss of amenity to adjoining neighbours due to an overbearing impact and loss of privacy, contrary to Havering Local Plan Policy 7 and the guidance within the Council's Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, it was necessary to issue a decision as close to the statutory timeframe as possible as opposed to seeking amendments which would have significantly delayed the application."
