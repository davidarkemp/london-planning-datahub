    "The proposed development would, by reason of its overall bulk and massing, be out of character with the prevailing pattern of development and would present as a dominant feature, detrimental to the visual amenity of the street scene, contrary to Local Plan Policy 7 and the Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD 2011.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal was given to the agent via email on 5 July 2022.",
    "The proposal, if granted planning permission on appeal, would be liable for the Mayor of London Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and Havering CIL.",
    "The proposal includes the creation of an additional 141 square metres of additional gross internal area (GIA) of residential space. Mayoral CIL is charged at £25 per square metre resulting in £3,525. Havering CIL is charged at £125 per square metre (for Residential development in Zone A - North), resulting in £17,625.",
    "Based upon the information supplied with the application, the CIL payable would be £21,150, subject to indexation. Further details with regard to CIL are available from the Council's website."
