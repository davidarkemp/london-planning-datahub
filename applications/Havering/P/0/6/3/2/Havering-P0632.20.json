    "The proposed extension by reason of its scale, bulk and design would unacceptably compromise the architectural composition of the building and the other twin/pair property. In particular the proposed front extension would dominate the existing Tudor style feature which forms the main feature in the principal elevation and additionally would appear dominant, incongruous and visually intrusive in the street scene contrary to Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD 2011, Hall Lane Policy Area SPD 2009 and Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD 2008.",
