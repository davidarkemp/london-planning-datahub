    "The proposal, by reason of the gabling of the main roof and gabled roof over the side extension would unbalance this pair of semi-detached dwellings to the detriment of the appearance of the properties and the character of the streetscene.  Additionally, the roof alterations, in combination with the excessively large rear dormer, would appear as an overly dominant and visually intrusive alteration at roof level, to the detriment of the character and amenity of the surrounding area, contrary to the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document and Policy 7 of the Havering Local Plan.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: In accordance with paragraph 38 of the National Planning Policy Framework, improvements required to make the proposal acceptable were negotiated with the agent via email 5th July.  The revisions involved removing the proposed hip to gable conversion and reducing size of the rear dormer.  The agent was contacted multiple times to provide updated drawings but amended drawings were not received."
